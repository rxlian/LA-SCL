"Aim: Most studies on the determinants of psychosocial functioning in first-episode psychosis used few predictors. This study examines the effects of multiple cognitive domains and multiple symptoms on psychosocial functioning. Methods: A total of 162 patients with a first-episode psychosis were assessed within 3 months after referral to an early psychosis treatment department. Four psychopathological subdomains (positive and negative symptoms, depression and anxiety) and five subdomains of psychosocial functioning (work/study, relationships, self-care, disturbing behaviour and general psychosocial functioning) were measured. Neurocognitive and social cognitive factors were identified through principal component analyses (PCA) of a 15-measure cognitive battery. Stepwise backward regression models were computed to identify the determinants of psychosocial functioning. Results: The three neurocognitive and four social cognitive factors identified through PCA were largely independent of psychopathology. The strongest associations were between cognitive factors and anxiety. Higher levels of negative symptoms, poor general neurocognition and poor general social cognition showed strongest associations with impaired psychosocial functioning, followed by low verbal processing speed and low emotion processing speed. Together, these factors accounted for 39.4% of the variance in psychosocial functioning. Conclusions: The results suggest that negative symptoms, impaired neurocognition and poor social cognition are related to psychosocial problems in patients with first-episode psychosis. None of the affective or positive symptoms had a marked impact on psychosocial functioning.",62
"The use of cement based composites as strain sensors have been studied by different researchers. The effect of ""cross talk for which the strain is perpendicular to electric current in the cement based composite, is an important issue for using the cement based material as a strain sensor. In this study, steel fiber reinforced cement matrix composite was tested with two different compression tests, at which compressive strain and electric current were parallel or perpendicular. The ""cross talk compression test"" at which electric current and compressive strain was perpendicular has been conducted for the first time in this study. Also, split tensile tests at which tensile strain and electric current were parallel or perpendicular were applied for the first time in this study. The cross gage factors were higher than the gage factors which were explained by mechanisms on variations of electron transfer cross sections. Strong linear relationships between the perpendicular compressive strain-electrical resistance change (%R) and perpendicular tensile strain-electrical resistance change (%R) were obtained. These strong linear relationships can be used to decompose the effects of ""cross talk"" in cement based sensor applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",103
"Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the deposition of amyloid-beta as extracellular plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau as intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. Tau pathology characterizes not only Alzheimer's disease, but also many other tauopathies, presenting tau as an attractive therapeutic target. Passive tau immunotherapy has been previously explored; however, because only a small fraction of peripherally delivered antibodies crosses the blood-brain barrier, enters the brain and engages with tau that forms intracellular aggregates, more efficient ways of antibody delivery and neuronal uptake are warranted. In the brain, tau exists as multiple isoforms. Here, we investigated the efficacy of a novel 2N tau isoform-specific single chain antibody fragment, RN2N, delivered by passive immunization in the P301L human tau transgenic pR5 mouse model. We demonstrate that, in treated mice, RN2N reduces anxiety-like behaviour and phosphorylation of tau at distinct sites. When administration of RN2N was combined with focused ultrasound in a scanning mode (scanning ultrasound), RN2N delivery into the brain and uptake by neurons were markedly increased, and efficacy was significantly enhanced. Our study provides evidence that scanning ultrasound is a viable tool to enhance the delivery of biologics across the blood-brain barrier and improve therapeutic outcomes and further presents single-chain antibodies as an alternative to full-length antibodies.",106
"Background: Despite clinical practice guidelines recommending the routine provision of nicotine dependence treatment to smokers in inpatient psychiatric facilities, the prevalence of such treatment provision is low. The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a clinical practice change intervention in increasing clinician recorded provision of nicotine dependence treatment to patients in inpatient psychiatric facilities. Methods: We undertook an interrupted time series analysis of nicotine dependence treatment provision before, during and after a clinical practice change intervention to increase clinician recorded provision of nicotine dependence treatment for all hospital discharges (aged >18 years, N = 4175) over a 19 month period in two inpatient adult psychiatric facilities in New South Wales, Australia. The clinical practice change intervention comprised six key strategies: leadership and consensus, enabling systems and procedures, training and education, information and resources, audit and feedback and an on-site practice change support officer. Systematic medical record audit and segmented logistic regression was used to determine differences in proportions for each nicotine dependence treatment outcome measure between the 'pre', 'during' and 'post-intervention' periods. Results: The prevalence of all five outcome measures increased significantly between the pre and post-intervention periods, including clinician recorded: assessment of patient smoking status (36.43 to 51.95%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.39, 99% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.23 to 4.66); assessment of patient nicotine dependence status (4.74 to 11.04%; AOR = 109.67, 99% CI: 35.35 to 340.22); provision of brief advice to quit (0.85 to 8.81%; AOR = 97.43, 99% CI: 31.03 to 306.30); provision of nicotine replacement therapy (8.06 to 26.25%; AOR = 19.59, 99% CI: 8.17 to 46.94); and provision of nicotine dependence treatment on discharge (8.82 to 13.45%, AOR = 12.36; 99% CI: 6.08 to 25.14). Conclusions: This is the first study to provide evidence that a clinical practice change intervention may increase clinician recorded provision of nicotine dependence treatment in inpatient psychiatric settings. The intervention offers a mechanism for psychiatric facilities to increase the provision of nicotine dependence treatment in accordance with clinical guidelines.",26
"This paper presents an economical launching and accelerating mode, including four ordered phases: pure electrical driving, clutch engagement and engine start-up, engine active charging, and engine driving, which can be fit for the alternating conditions and improve the fuel economy of hybrid electric bus (HEB) during typical city-bus driving scenarios. By utilizing the fast response feature of electric motor (EM), an adaptive controller for EM is designed to realize the power demand during the pure electrical driving mode, the engine starting mode and the engine active charging mode. Concurrently, the smoothness issue induced by the sequential mode transitions is solved with a coordinated control logic for engine, EM and clutch. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed launching and accelerating mode and its control methods are effective in improving the fuel economy and ensure the drivability during the fast transition between the operation modes of HEB.

"Every complex problem now days require multicriteria decision making to get to the desired solution. Numerous Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approaches have evolved over recent time to accommodate various application areas and have been recently explored as alternative to solve complex software engineering problems. Most widely used approach is Analytic Hierarchy Process that combines mathematics and expert judgment. Analytic Hierarchy Process suffers from the problem of imprecision and subjectivity. This paper proposes to use Fuzzy AHP (FAHP) instead of traditional AHP method. The usage of FAHP helps decision makers to make better choices both in relation to tangible criteria and intangible criteria. The paper provides a clear guide on how FAHP can be applied, particularly in the software engineering area in specific situations. The conclusion of this study would help and motivate practitioners and researchers to use multi-criteria decision making approaches in the area of software engineering.",123
"In this paper, a new formulation for coupled circuit-electromagnetic (EM) simulation is presented. The formulation employs full-wave integral equations to model the EM behavior of two- or three-dimensional structures while using modified nodal analysis to model circuit interactions. A coupling scheme based on charge and current continuity and potential matching, realized as a generalization of Kirchoff's voltage and current laws, ensures that the EM and circuit interactions can be formulated as a seamless system. While rigorous port models for EM structures can be obtained using the approach discussed herein, it is shown that the coupling paradigm can reveal additional details of the EM-circuit interactions and can provide a path to analysis-based design iteration.",47
"In a brief glance at an object or shape, we can appreciate a rich suite of its functional properties, including the organization of the object's parts, its optimal contact points for grasping, and its center of mass, or balancing point. However, in the real world and the laboratory, balance perception shows systematic biases whereby observers may misjudge a shape's center of mass by a severe margin. Are such biases simply quirks of physical reasoning? Or might they instead reflect more fundamental principles of object representation? Here we demonstrate systematically biased center-of-mass estimation for two-dimensional (2D) shapes (Study 1) and advance a surprising explanation of such biases. We suggest that the mind implicitly represents ordinary 2D shapes as rich, volumetric, three-dimensional (3D) objects, and that these ""inflated"" shape representations intrude on and bias perception of the 2D shape's geometric properties. Such ""inflation"" is a computer-graphics technique for segmenting shapes into parts, and we show that a model derived from this technique best accounts for the biases in center-of-mass estimation in Study 1. Further supporting this account, we show that reducing the need for inflated shape representations diminishes such biases: Center-of-mass estimation improved when cues to shapehood were attenuated (Study 2) and when shapes' depths were explicitly depicted using real-life objects laser-cut from wood (Study 3). We suggest that the technique of shape inflation is actually implemented in the mind; thus, biases in our impressions of balance reflect a more general functional characteristic of object perception.",79
"Translation initiation in eukaryotes and archaea involves a methionylated initiator tRNA delivered to the ribosome in a ternary complex with e/aIF2 and GTP. Eukaryotic and archaeal initiator tRNAs contain a highly conserved A(1)-U-72 base pair at the top of the acceptor stem. The importance of this base pair to discriminate initiator tRNAs from elongator tRNAs has been established previously using genetics and biochemistry. However, no structural data illustrating how the A(1)-U-72 base pair participates in the accurate selection of the initiator tRNAs by the translation initiation systems are available. Here, we describe the crystal structure of a mutant E. coil initiator tRNA(f)(Met)A(1)-U-72, aminoacylated with methionine, in which the Cl: A(72) mismatch at the end of the tRNA acceptor stem has been changed to an A(1)-U-72 base pair. Sequence alignments show that the mutant E. coli tRNA is a good mimic of archaeal initiator tRNAs. The crystal structure, determined at 2.8 angstrom resolution, shows that the A(1)-U-72 pair adopts an unusual arrangement. A(1) is in a syn conformation and forms a single H-bond interaction with U-72. This interaction requires protonation of the N1 atom of A(1). Moreover, the 5' phosphoryl group folds back into the major groove of the acceptor stem and interacts with the N-7 atom of G(2). A possible role of this unusual geometry of the A(1)-U-72 pair in the recognition of the initiator tRNA by its partners during eukaryotic and archaeal translation initiation is discussed.",34
"In the ontology engineering field, key aspects of real-world business contexts are not normally taken into account. One of these crucial aspects is that of planning and scheduling. Software engineering practitioners use different approaches and tools for planning and scheduling software development projects, whereas their counterparts in ontology engineering encounter many problems to create project plans and schedules. To bridge the gap we have created a method and a tool (the latter called gOntt) for systematizing the scheduling of ontology development projects in the context of the NeOn Methodology. In this paper we try to explain the methodological pillars in which method and tool are grounded. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",123
"This study considers intellectual capital based on the assumption that this capital, which possesses social aspects, is related to the emotional capacities (i.e., emotional intelligence) of an organization's members. A literature review indicates that this relationship has been previously noted and studied, and researchers agree that the emotional intelligence of the members of an organization affects the organization's intellectual capital. Based on this analysis, this relationship is examined in the Turkish business context. Data are collected from top managers, who can affect the intellectual capital of their businesses and who, as human beings, are emotional. Thus, in this study, the emotional intelligence of top managers and their opinions regarding the intellectual capital of their businesses are considered to be related, with interesting results. When all of the factors of emotional intelligence that are likely to affect opinions regarding intellectual capital are examined using a multivariate model, the effect of emotional intelligence is revealed. Primarily, three factors of the emotional intelligence-empathy and communication skill, self-awareness and sociability-affect the participants' opinions regarding the intellectual capital of their businesses. Univariate models are used to evaluate the effect of each emotional intelligence factor on the participants' opinions regarding the intellectual capital of their businesses. Empathy and communication skills affect opinions about the quality of human capital. Self-awareness affects opinions about the organizational commitment of workers. Sociability can affect opinions about information technology and information sharing. In summary, emotional intelligence affects opinions about human capital quality, information technology and information sharing.",64
"Aim: To investigate impulsive behaviors in pathological buying (PB). Methods: The study included three groups matched for age and gender: treatment seeking outpatients with PB (PB+), treatment seeking psychiatric inpatients without PB (PB-), and a healthy control group (HC). PB was assessed by means of the Compulsive Buying Scale and by the impulse control disorder (ICD) module of the research version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-ICD). All participants answered questionnaires concerning symptoms of borderline personality disorder, self-harming behaviors, binge eating and symptoms of attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In addition, comorbid ICDs were assessed using the SCID-ICD. Results: The PB+ and PB-groups did not differ with regard to borderline personality disorder or ADHD symptoms, but both groups reported significantly more symptoms than the HC group. Frequencies of self-harming behaviors did not differ between the three groups. Patients with PB were more often diagnosed with any current ICD (excluding PB) compared to those without PB and the HC group (38.7% vs. 12.9% vs. 12.9%, respectively, p=.17). Discussion: Our findings confirm prior research suggesting more impulsive behaviors in patients with and without PB compared to healthy controls. The results of the questionnaire-based assessment indicate that outpatients with PB perceive themselves equally impulsive and self-harm as frequently as inpatients without PB; but they seem to suffer more often from an ICD as assessed by means of an interview.",70
"Building on the simulated-amnesia work of Christianson and Bylin (Applied Cognitive Psychology, 13, 495-511, 1999), the present research introduces a new paradigm for the scientific study of memory of childhood sexual abuse information. In Session 1, participants mentally took the part of an abuse victim as they read an account of the sexual assault of a 7-year-old. After reading the narrative, participants were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions: They (1) rehearsed the story truthfully (truth group), (2) left out the abuse details of the story (omission group), (3) lied about the abuse details to indicate that no abuse had occurred (commission group), or (4) did not recall the story during Session 1 (no-rehearsal group). One week later, participants returned for Session 2 and were asked to truthfully recall the narrative. The results indicated that, relative to truthful recall, untruthful recall or no rehearsal at Session 1 adversely affected memory performance at Session 2. However, untruthful recall resulted in better memory than did no rehearsal. Moreover, gender, PTSD symptoms, depression, adult attachment, and sexual abuse history significantly predicted memory for the childhood sexual abuse scenario. Implications for theory and application are discussed.",78
"The American flag is a powerful symbol that campaigns seek to harness for electoral gain. But the flag's benefits may be more elusive than they appear. We begin by presenting content analysis of the flag's prevalence in 2012 U.S. presidential campaign ads, which suggests both candidates saw flags as advantageous. Then, in two experiments set during the 2012 campaign and a later study with prospective 2016 candidates, we find flag exposure provides modest but consistent benefits for Republican candidates among voters high in symbolic patriotism, racial prejudice, and Republican identification. These effects arise regardless of which candidate appears with the flag. Taken together, our results speak to both the power and limitations of the American flag in electioneering. Beyond practical implications for campaigns, these studies emphasize the heterogeneity of citizens' reactions to visual political symbols and highlight potent links between symbolic attitudes and a nation's flag.",61
"Focal chondral defects of the articular surface are a common occurrence in the field of orthopaedics. These isolated cartilage injuries, if not repaired surgically with restoration of articular congruency, may have a high rate of progression to posttraumatic osteoarthritis, resulting in significant morbidity and loss of function in the young, active patient. Both isolated and global joint disease are a difficult entity to treat in the clinical setting given the high amount of stress on weightbearing joints and the limited healing potential of native articular cartilage. Recently, clinical interest has focused on the use of biologically active compounds and surgical techniques to regenerate native cartilage to the articular surface, with the goal of restoring normal joint health and overall function. This article presents a review of the current biologic therapies, as discussed at the 2015 American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM) Biologics Think Tank, that are used in the treatment of focal cartilage deficiencies. For each of these emerging therapies, the theories for application, the present clinical evidence, and specific areas for future research are explored, with focus on the barriers currently faced by clinicians in advancing the success of these therapies in the clinical setting.",27
"The model predictive control (MPC) technique for a solar-based series-resonant inverter conventionally used in domestic heating is explored. The photovoltaic energy system (PVES) converts the solar energy into electrical energy where DC voltages of different cells are linked at a common bus. A Cuk-converter is used to interface the PVES with the DC load bus and the heating inverter. These heating inverters are replacing gas cookers in restaurants, guest rooms, and domestic- and commercial-kitchens for cooking of various foods. A number of control algorithms have been employed to control the power of the heating inverter but they have certain limitations; especially they do not predict the future response of the circuit. The MPC, an advanced control approach, has the potential to estimate the future behaviour of the model in a predictive manner. Hence, to control the power of the resonant inverter connected with a 3.36 kW heating load, MPC is applied. The simulation results verify the validity of the power control of a solar-based series-resonant inverter using the MPC algorithm.",100
"Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are a popular model system for investigating development, tissue regeneration, and repair. Although much is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate the balance between self-renewal and lineage commitment in PSCs, the spatiotemporal integration of responsive signaling pathways with core transcriptional regulatory networks are complex and only partially understood. Moreover, measurements made on populations of cells reveal only average properties of the underlying regulatory networks, obscuring their fine detail. Here, we discuss the reconstruction of regulatory networks in individual cells using novel single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics, in order to expand our understanding of the molecular basis of pluripotency, including the role of cell-cell variability within PSC populations, and ways in which networks may be controlled in order to reliably manipulate cell behavior.",31
"Flexible querying has been developed with the aim of proposing powerful and user-friendly ways of setting and solving queries. Within the context of flexible querying, the use of bipolar queries has deserved the attention of the research community as a way of distinguishing in queries negative and positive assessments of data. Bipolar queries have been specially studied in the framework of crisp relational databases. In this paper, we propose an approach to bipolar queries in fuzzy object databases. Through the use of a generalized inclusion concept, we deal with bipolar conditions on both fuzzy univalued and multivalued attributes. The consistence of the proposed approach with the bipolar queries rationale is also analyzed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",112
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the impact of human resource development (HRD) on engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) project success (PS), human resource competency (HRC), job performance (JP), and the interrelationship among them. This paper also investigates the impact of EPC project factors (PF) on PS, the factors affecting HRD, including internal factors (IF) and external factors (EF) during EPC project implementation. Design/methodology/approach - Structural equation modeling (SEM), SPSS, and AMOS software were used to test nine proposed hypotheses. The respondents comprised 800 participants involved in EPC projects throughout Vietnam. Findings - The results show that HRD positively affects HRC, JP, and PS. HRD is influenced by IF but not influenced by EF. HRC positively impacts on JP and PS, while PF directly impacts on PS. Originality/value - The study indicates that the development of competent human resources for EPC project implementation plays a considerable role in EPC PS. The findings also give project professionals a tool for improving HRD, and HRC to increase the likelihood of PS.",102
"Time-delays (dead time) are found in many processes in industrial practice. Time-delays are mainly caused by the time required to transport mass, energy and information. In many cases time-delay is caused by the effect produced by the accumulation of a large number of low-order systems. One of possibilities of control of such processes is their approximation by lower-order model with time-delay. The contribution is focused on the design of an algorithm for digital control of high order process that is approximated by a second-order model with time-delay. The controller algorithms use the digital modification of the linear quadratic (LQ) Smith predictor (SP). The LQ criterion was combined with pole assignment principle. These algorithms were applied to the control of a set of equal liquid cylinder atmospheric tanks.",48
"Phytoene synthase (PSY) is a key regulatory enzyme of carotenoid biosynthesis pathway in plants. The present study examines the role of PSY in carotenogenesis and stress management in banana. Germplasm screening of 10 Indian cultivars showed that Nendran (3011.94 mu g/100 g dry weight) and Rasthali (105.35 mu g/100 g dry weight) contained the highest and lowest amounts of beta-carotene, respectively in ripe fruit-pulp. Nendran ripe pulp also showed significantly higher antioxidant activity as compared to Rasthali. Meta-analysis of three banana PSY genes (MaPSY1, MaPSY2, and MaPSY3) was performed to identify their structural features, subcellular, and chromosomal localization in banana genome. The distinct expression patterns of MaPSY1, MaPSY2, and MaPSY3 genes were observed in various tissues, and fruit developmental stages of these two contrasting cultivars, suggesting differential regulation of the banana PSY genes. A positive correlation was observed between the expression of MaPSY1 and beta-carotene accumulation in the ripe fruit-peel and pulp of Nendran. The presence of stress responsive cis regulatory motifs in promoter region of MaPSY genes were correlated with the expression pattern during various stress (abscisic acid, methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid and dark) treatments. The positive modulation of MaPSY1 noticed under abiotic stresses suggested its role in plant physiological functions and defense response. The amino acid sequence analysis of the PSY proteins in contrasting cultivars revealed that all PSY comprises conserved domains related to enzyme activity. Bacterial complementation assay has validated the functional activity of six PSY proteins and among them PSY1 of Nendran (Nen-PSY1) gave the highest activity. These data provide new insights into the regulation of PSY expression in banana by developmental and stress related signals that can be explored in the banana improvement programs.",29
"Social learning requires inferring social information about another person, as well as evaluating outcomes. Previous research shows that prior social information biases decision making and reduces reliance on striatal activity during learning (Delgado, Frank, & Phelps, Nature Neuroscience 8 (11): 1611-1618, 2005). A rich literature in social psychology on person perception demonstrates that people spontaneously infer social information when viewing another person (Fiske & Taylor, 2013) and engage a network of brain regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex, temporal parietal junction, superior temporal sulcus, and precuneus (Amodio & Frith, Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 7(4), 268-277, 2006; Haxby, Gobbini, & Montgomery, 2004; van Overwalle Human Brain Mapping, 30, 829-858, 2009). We investigate the role of these brain regions during social learning about well-established dimensions of person perception-trait warmth and trait competence. We test the hypothesis that activity in person perception brain regions interacts with learning structures during social learning. Participants play an investment game where they must choose an agent to invest on their behalf. This choice is guided by cues signaling trait warmth or trait competence based on framing of monetary returns. Trait warmth information impairs learning about human but not computer agents, while trait competence information produces similar learning rates for human and computer agents. We see increased activation to warmth information about human agents in person perception brain regions. Interestingly, activity in person perception brain regions during the decision phase negatively predicts activity in the striatum during feedback for trait competence inferences about humans. These results suggest that social learning may engage additional processing within person perception brain regions that hampers learning in economic contexts.",63
"In this work, we consider multitask learning problems where clusters of nodes are interested in estimating their own parameter vector. Cooperation among clusters is beneficial when the optimal models of adjacent clusters have a good number of similar entries. We propose a fully distributed algorithm for solving this problem. The approach relies on minimizing a global mean-square error criterion regularized by nondifferentiable terms to promote cooperation among neighboring clusters. A general diffusion forward-backward splitting strategy is introduced. Then, it is specialized to the case of sparsity promoting regularizers. A closed-form expression for the proximal operator of a weighted sum of l(1)-norms is derived to achieve higher efficiency. We also provide conditions on the step-sizes that ensure convergence of the algorithm in the mean and mean-square error sense. Simulations are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the strategy.",49
"The heat transfer and entropy generation in a magnetohydrodynamic flow of Al2O3-water nanofluid through a porous vertical microchannel with nonlinear radiative heat flux were investigated numerically. Then, combined effects of nanoparticle volume fraction, hydrodynamic slip, magnetic field, suction/injection and thermal radiation on heat transfer and entropy generation were studied. The dimensionless governing equations were solved numerically by applying Runge-Kutta integration method together with shooting technique. In this study, the accuracy of the numerical results was verified by comparing its predictions with exact solutions of model without both radiation effects and buoyancy force. Here, different from previous literature, heat transfer subject to nonlinear thermal radiation; Joule heating and viscous dissipation was solved and analyzed using conjugate convective-radiative heat transfer on the boundary surfaces. Moreover, influences of pertinent parameters on nanofluid velocity, temperature, local and global entropy generation and Nusselt number were discussed in detail and illustrated graphically. Based on the numerical results, it was proved that the global entropy generation decreased with both nanoparticle volume fraction and suction/injection Reynolds number while it increased with Grashof number (Buoyancy force intensity), radiation parameter and conduction-radiation parameter. In addition, it was possible to determine optimum values of slip flow with minimum values of global entropy generation rate. The Nusselt number was also calculated and explored for different conditions. In this way, optimum values of Grashof number with maximum heat transfer on the heated left plate were derived.

"An intronic GGGGCC expansion in C9orf72 is the most common known cause of both frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The repeat expansion leads to the generation of sense and antisense repeat RNA aggregates and dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins, generated by repeat-associated non-ATG translation. The arginine-rich DPR proteins poly(glycine-arginine or GR) and poly(proline-arginine or PR) are potently neurotoxic and can localise to the nucleolus when expressed in cells, resulting in enlarged nucleoli with disrupted functionality. Furthermore, GGGGCC repeat RNA can bind nucleolar proteins in vitro. However, the relevance of nucleolar stress is unclear, as the arginine-rich DPR proteins do not localise to the nucleolus in C9orf72-associated FTLD/ALS (C9FTLD/ALS) patient brain. We measured nucleolar size in C9FTLD frontal cortex neurons using a three-dimensional, volumetric approach. Intriguingly, we found that C9FTLD brain exhibited bidirectional nucleolar stress. C9FTLD neuronal nucleoli were significantly smaller than control neuronal nucleoli. However, within C9FTLD brains, neurons containing poly(GR) inclusions had significantly larger nucleolar volumes than neurons without poly(GR) inclusions. In addition, expression of poly(GR) in adult Drosophila neurons led to significantly enlarged nucleoli. A small but significant increase in nucleolar volume was also observed in C9FTLD frontal cortex neurons containing GGGGCC repeat-containing RNA foci. These data show that nucleolar abnormalities are a consistent feature of C9FTLD brain, but that diverse pathomechanisms are at play, involving both DPR protein and repeat RNA toxicity.",119
"This paper uses the idea of a ""charismatic gap'' to help explain the disjuncture between the burden of disease attributable to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in the global south and a tendency to view this as something of 'an esoteric distraction from more pressing concerns in global health' such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, TB, vaccination and maternal health (Livingston, Improvising Medicine: An African Oncology Ward in an Emerging Cancer Epidemic. Durham: Duke University Press, 2012, p. 9). NCDs are a composite category of cardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases, cancer and diabetes grouped together by virtue of four shared risk factors (tobacco, alcohol, unhealthy diets and sedentarism). While infectious diseases spread through viruses or bacteria under conditions of contagion that can provoke fear, disgust, suspicion and irrationality amid physical suffering and high mortality rates, NCDs have too often been met with ennui. This paper draws on the concept of charisma to help explore and explain the 'neglected epidemic' of NCDs in the global south through four themes: The lexicon used to describe, frame and communicate NCDs; risk factors and culpability; the temporality of disease and its embodiment. In conclusion, the paper reflects on how to activate the latent charismatic potential of NCDs in the global south.",132
"c-Kit is a tyrosine kinase receptor important for gametogenesis, hematopoiesis, melanogenesis and mast cell biology. Dysregulation of c-Kit function is oncogenic and its expression in the stem cell niche of a number of tissues has underlined its relevance for regenerative medicine and hematopoietic stem cell biology. Yet, very little is known about the mechanisms that control c-Kit protein levels. Here we show that the RanBPM/RanBP9 scaffold protein binds to c-Kit and is necessary for normal c-Kit protein expression in the mouse testis and subset lineages of the hematopoietic system. RanBPM deletion causes a reduction in c-Kit protein but not its mRNA suggesting a posttranslational mechanism. This regulation is specific to the c-Kit receptor since RanBPM reduction does not affect other membrane proteins examined. Importantly, in both mouse hematopoietic system and testis, RanBPM deficiency causes defects consistent with c-Kit loss of expression suggesting that RanBPM is an important regulator of c-Kit function. The finding that this regulatory mechanism is also present in human cells expressing endogenous RanBPM and c-Kit suggests a potential new strategy to target oncogenic c-Kit in malignancies.",31
"There has been significant recent interest in sensing systems and 'smart environments', with a number of longitudinal studies in this area. Typically the goal of these studies is to develop methods to predict, at any one moment of time, the activity or activities that the resident(s) of the home are engaged in, which may in turn be used for determining normal or abnormal patterns of behaviour (e.g. in a health-care setting). Classification algorithms, such as Conditional Random Field (CRFs), typically consider sensor activations as features but these are often treated as if they were independent, which in general they are not. Our hypothesis is that learning patterns based on combinations of sensors will be more powerful than single sensors alone. The exhaustive approach to take all possible combinations of sensors and learn classifier Weights for each combination is clearly computationally prohibitive. We show that through the application of signal processing and information theoretic techniques we can learn about the sensor topology in the home (i.e. learn an adjacency matrix) which enables us to determine the combinations of sensors that will be useful for classification ahead of time. As a result we can achieve classification performance better than that of the exhaustive approach, whilst only incurring a small cost in terms of computational resources. We demonstrate our results on several datasets, showing that our method is robust in terms of variations in the layout and the number of residents in the house. Furthermore, we have incorporated the adjacency matrix into the CRF learning framework and have shown that it can improve performance over multiple baselines.",1
"Conditional differential cryptanalysis on NFSR-based cryptosystems was first proposed by Knellwolf et al. in Asiacrypt 2010 and has been successfully used to attack reduced variants of Grain v1. In this paper, we greatly improve conditional differential attacks on Grain v1 in the following four aspects. First, a new differential engine is derived to correctly track the differential trails of Grain v1. Second, we propose a new difference-searching strategy which serves to find suitable differences for the conditional differential attack on a given reduced variant of Grain v1. Third, a highly IV-saving condition-imposing strategy is presented. Last, we propose a further bias-increasing strategy. In particular, the improvements on the difference-searching strategy and the condition-imposing strategy are crucial to mount conditional differential attacks on the variants of Grain v1 with more than 106 rounds. It is shown that the improved conditional differential attacks could retrieve 31 distinct secret key expressions for 107-round Grain v1 and could retrieve 15 distinct secret key expressions for 110-round Grain v1. Both the attacks succeed with constant probabilities. Thus far, our results are the best known for the reduced variants of Grain v1 as far as the number of rounds attacked is concerned.",57
"HRDBMS is a novel distributed relational database that uses a hybrid model combining the best of traditional distributed relational databases and Big Data analytics platforms such as Hive. This allows HRDBMS to leverage years worth of research regarding query optimization, while also taking advantage of the scalability of Big Data platforms. The system uses an execution framework that is tailored for relational processing, thus addressing some of the performance challenges of running SQL on top of platforms such as MapReduce and Spark. These include excessive materialization of intermediate results, lack of a global cost based optimization, unnecessary sorting, lack of index support, no statistics, no support for DML and ACID, and excessive communication caused by the rigid communication patterns enforced by these platforms.",112
"Four CreER lines that are commonly used in the auditory field to label cochlear supporting cells (SCs) are expressed in multiple SC subtypes, with some lines also showing reporter expression in hair cells (HCs). We hypothesized that altering the tamoxifen dose would modify CreER expression and target subsets of SCs. We also used two different reporter lines, ROSA26 (tdTomato) and CAG-eGFP, to achieve the same goal. Our results confirm previous reports that Sox2 (CreERT2) and Fgfr3-iCreER (T2) are not only expressed in neonatal SCs but also in HCs. Decreasing the tamoxifen dose did not reduce HC expression for Sox2 (CreERT2) , but changing to the CAG-eGFP reporter decreased reporter-positive HCs sevenfold. However, there was also a significant decrease in the number of reporter-positive SCs. In contrast, there was a large reduction in reporter-positive HCs in Fgfr3-iCreER (T2) mice with the lowest tamoxifen dose tested yet only limited reduction in SC labeling. The targeting of reporter expression to inner phalangeal and border cells was increased when Plp-CreER (T2) was paired with the CAG-eGFP reporter; however, the total number of labeled cells decreased. Changes to the tamoxifen dose or reporter line with Prox1 (CreERT2) caused minimal changes. Our data demonstrate that modifications to the tamoxifen dose or the use of different reporter lines may be successful in narrowing the numbers and/or types of cells labeled, but each CreER line responded differently. When the ROSA26 (tdTomato) reporter was combined with any of the four CreER lines, there was no difference in the number of tdTomato-positive cells after one or two injections of tamoxifen given at birth. Thus, tamoxifen-mediated toxicity could be reduced by only giving one injection. While the CAG-eGFP reporter consistently labeled fewer cells, both reporter lines are valuable depending on the goal of the study.",34
"In a typical, entanglement-based quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols the maximally entangled, singlet states are used. The standard way to generate them is to use parametric down conversion with low intensity laser beams. This way the probability to produce two or more entangled pairs is negligible. However, one obtains it at a cost of a large likelihood of producing no particles at all. In this work, we ask the question if this approach is the optimal one from the point of view of key generation rate. For a case study, we take BBM 92 protocol and find the optimal intensity of the beam. We show optimal intensities are much higher than the ones typically used. Our results can be generalized to other protocols based on singlet states.",57
"This paper presents various experimental tests on the sensorless capability of induction motors (IM). An intentionally created saliency is introduced in the rotor so as to allow the rotor position to be estimated by means of a high-frequency (HF) injected signal in the stator winding. Experimental measurements are carried out on three prototypes, two with saliency and the third without saliency, as reference. The critical aspects in the prototype realization are discussed in this paper. Suggestion on how to solve them from the machine design point of view is included. The rotor saliency has been measured by means of an HF injection. Then, the steady-state performance has been measured, together with the mechanical characteristic of the three prototypes. FE analysis is used to predict the variation of the IM parameters with rotor position. The results are compared with those achieved from measurements.",85
"Objective: High rates of bipolar disorder (BD) have been found among major depressives with seasonal pattern (SP) consulting in psychiatric departments, as well as among patients seeking primary care. As SP was reported to be common in the latter, the current study was designed to assess (a) the frequency and characteristics of SP among major depressives attending primary care and (b) the prevalence and aspects of BD in this population. Methods: Among 400 patients who consulted French general practitioners (GPs) for major depression between February and December 2010, 390 could be included in the study: 167 (42.8%) met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria for seasonal pattern [SP(+)], whereas 223 (57.2%) did not meet these criteria [SP(-)]. The two groups were compared on demographic, clinical, family history and temperamental characteristics. Results: Compared to SP(-), SP(+) patients were more frequently female, married and with a later age at first depressive episode, and showed more atypical vegetative symptoms, comorbid bulimia and stimulant abuse. They also exhibited more lifetime depressive episodes, were more often diagnosed as having BD II and met more often bipolarity specifier criteria, with higher rates of bipolar temperaments and a higher BD family loading. Among SP(+) patients, 68.9% met the bipolarity specifier criteria, whereas 31.1% did not. Seasonality was not influenced by climatic conditions. The following independent variables were associated with SP: BD according to bipolarity specifier, female gender, comorbid bulimia nervosa, hypersomnia, number of depressive episodes and family history of substance abuse. Conclusions: Seasonal pattern is frequent among depressive patients attending primary care in France and may be indicative of hidden bipolarity. Given the risks associated with both SP and bipolarity, GPs are likely to have a major role in regard to prevention. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",71
"The business life has been generally percieved as a male activity because of its energy-exhaustive nature. Consequently, organisations have been expecting a work quality taht reflects male standards of living in terms of availability and assertiveness, which led organizations to shape their leadership model by masculine principles and values. The present study examines whether female leadership is seen as effectice as male leadership in a Middle Eastern context. A survey has been distributed to a random sample of employees wiorking in the public sector and based in the United Arab Emirates, and a group of informal interviews were held to investigate the quantitaive findings. The results obtained from 117 participants revealed that an average of 66.7% (p<0.0001) of the population see that Male leaders can gain more control over employees than female leaders, and 10.3% (P=0.005) see that male leaders are better than female leaders in making decisions versus 0.9% see the opposite. On the other side, 54.7% (P<0.0001) see that female leaders are more insirational than male leaders, and 31.6% (p<0.0001) viewed female leaders as having better observational abilities than male leaders in the Middle East work environment (Cronbach's alpha 0.740). The paper conludes with a highlight on the role of educaiton in building the social construction of gender and how it forms the individuals' perception of gender roles. As a result, stereotypes emerge, affecting the view of leaders, regardless of ther actual current abilities. (C) 2016 IASE Publisher. All rights reserved.",77
"Background: The Biomembrane Force Probe is an approachable experimental technique commonly used for single-molecule force spectroscopy and experiments on biological interfaces. The technique operates in the range of forces from 0.1 pN to 1000 pN. Experiments are typically repeated many times, conditions are often not optimal, the captured video can be unstable and lose focus; this makes efficient analysis challenging, while out-of-the-box non-proprietary solutions are not freely available. Results: This dedicated tool was developed to integrate and simplify the image processing and analysis of videomicroscopy recordings from BFP experiments. A novel processing feature, allowing the tracking of the pipette, was incorporated to address a limitation of preceding methods. Emphasis was placed on versatility and comprehensible user interface implemented in a graphical form. Conclusions: An integrated analytical tool was implemented to provide a faster, simpler and more convenient way to process and analyse BFP experiments.",90
"In this paper, by proposing a generalized specific volume, we restudy the P-V criticality of charged AdS black holes in the extended phase space. The results show that most of the previous conclusions can be generalized without change, but the ratio. (p) over tildec should be 3 (alpha) over tilde /16 in general case. Further research on the thermodynamical phase transition of black hole leads us to a natural interpretation of our assumption, and more black hole properties can be generalized. Finally, we study the number density for charged AdS black hole in higher dimensions, the results show the necessity of our assumption.",88
"Many small RNAs have been cloned from animal gonads, for example, endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs) were found in oocytes and piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) were found in testis. Gallus gallus (chicken) is an important model organism, but few small RNAs have been identified from its gonads. In this study, we isolated and cloned 156 small RNAs from adult chicken testes. Since there is a reasonably even distribution from 22 to 33 nt, these small RNAs are slightly longer than miRNAs and endo-siRNAs. Genome mapping indicated that these small RNAs were derived from intergenic regions, exons, introns, and repetitive elements including chicken repeat 1, long terminal repeats, and simple repeats. Since they are similar with piRNAs, we named them piRNA-like RNAs (pil-RNAs). Northern blotting of 16 selected sequences showed that nine are specifically expressed in the adult testis. The vast majority of these pil-RNAs are poorly conserved between species, suggesting that they are unique to the adult chicken testis. Further analysis of the cloned pil-RNAs will improve our understanding of the function of small RNAs in animal gonad development.",38
"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects individuals across all racial and ethnic groups, yet rates of diagnosis are disproportionately higher for Black and Hispanic children. Caregivers of children with ASD experience significant stressors, which have been associated with parental strain, inadequate utilization of mental health services and lower quality of life. The family peer advocate (FPA) model has been utilized across service delivery systems to provide family-to-family support, facilitate engagement, and increase access to care. This study used a randomized controlled design to examine the efficacy of FPAs in a racially and ethnically diverse sample. Results demonstrate significantly increased knowledge of ASD and reduced levels of stress for caregivers who received the FPA intervention as compared to treatment as usual.",113
"Glass fiber-reinforced composite materials are finding numerous applications in many engineering and domestic fields due to their excellent mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. Among the machining processes used, drilling is one of the most important processes and is mainly used in joining of composite structures. Maintaining of proper surface roughness in drilled holes is very important and is to be controlled. In the present work prediction of surface roughness in drilling of composite materials is carried out using fuzzy logic. In recent years, fuzzy logic in artificial intelligence has been used in manufacturing engineering for modeling and monitoring. An L27 orthogonal array is used for experimentation. A fuzzy rule-based model is developed to predict the surface roughness in drilling of glass fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP) composites. Good agreement is observed between the model results and experimental values. The analysis of experimental results is carried out using Pareto analysis of variance (Pareto-ANOVA) and ANOVA and presented in detail.",84
Brain glucose uptake declines during aging and is significantly impaired in Alzheimer's disease. Ketones are the main alternative brain fuel to glucose so they represent a potential approach to compensate for the brain glucose reduction. Caffeine is of interest as a potential ketogenic agent owing to its actions on lipolysis and lipid oxidation but whether it is ketogenic in humans is unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the acute ketogenic effect of 2 doses of caffeine (2.5; 5.0 mg/kg) in 10 healthy adults. Caffeine given at breakfast significantly stimulated ketone production in a dose-dependent manner (+88%; +116%) and also raised plasma free fatty acids. Whether caffeine has long-term ketogenic effects or could enhance the ketogenic effect of medium chain triglycerides remains to be determined.,106
"Context: Troponin T upstream open reading frame peptide (TnTuORF) may be useful as a novel biomarker in acute cardiac syndromes.Objective: The study examined the early release kinetics of TnTuORF.Materials and methods: We analyzed the time course of the release of cardiac troponins I and T and TnTuORF in patients (n=31) with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy undergoing transcoronary ablation of septal hypertrophy (TASH).Results: Fifteen minutes after TASH, the levels of both troponins increased significantly (cTnT median: 18ng/L versus 27ng/L; cTnI median: 15ng/L versus 25ng/L). TnTuORF showed no variation.Discussion: We observed a significantly greater increase in cTnI compared with cTnT.Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that troponin assays allow early detection of myocardial injury, whereas TnTuORF levels remain unchanged in this setting.",111

Given that China's power sector transition is a huge task, we hope this review will add some discussions into the ongoing conversation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",43
"The Meckel's cartilage itself and the mandible are derived from the first branchial arch, and their development depends upon the contribution of the cranial neural crest cells. The prenatal development of the Meckel's cartilage, along with its relationship to the developing mandible and the related structures, were studied histologically in human embryos and fetuses. The material was obtained from a collection of the Department of Anatomy, and laboratory procedures were used to prepare sections, which were stained according to standard light-microscopy methods. The formation of the Meckel's cartilage and its related structures was observed and documented. Some critical moments in the development of the Meckel's cartilage are suggested. The sequential development of the Meckel's cartilage started as early as stage 13 (32 days) with the appearance of condensation of mesenchymal cells within the mandibular prominence. During stage 17 (41 days), the primary ossification center of the mandible appeared on the inferior margin of the Meckel's cartilage. The muscular attachments to the Meckel's cartilage in embryos were observed at stage 18 (44 days). Their subsequent movement into the developing mandible during the 10th week seemed to diminish the role of the Meckel's cartilage as the supportive core; simultaneously, the process of regression within the cartilage was induced. During the embryonic period, the bilateral Meckel's cartilages were in closest contact at the posterior surface of their superior margins, preceding formation of the symphyseal cartilage at this site. The event sequence in the development of the Meckel's cartilage is finally discussed.",75

"There are inconsistent findings about the role of Blastocystis infection in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The present study was aimed to determine the frequency of Blastocystis and their subtypes (ST) in patients with IBS. A total of 122 patients with IBS and 122 healthy individuals referred to the medical laboratory centers in Ahvaz (southwest of Iran) participated in the study. The frequency of Blastocystis was determined. Blastocystis genomic DNA was extracted from positive feces, and PCR was performed using seven primer pairs targeting the SSU rDNA gene. Blastocystis was detected in 19.67% of patients with IBS and 17.2% of individuals without IBS. The difference between two groups was not statistically significant (P = 03). Among the five subtypes of Blastocystis, ST3 was more common in patients with IBS and control group. However, there were no significant differences between two groups in terms of subtypes of Blastocystis (P = 0.6). It seems, the role of Blastocystis in the etiology of IBS should be further investigated. Furthermore, a model of study should be designed to investigate the role of host factors in severity of parasitic disease. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",4
"Perceived criticism (PC) is a construct that plays a key role in family relationships of persons with psychiatric disorders. It can be assessed in a brief and simple way using the Perceived Criticism Measure. PC ratings made by patients about their caregivers predict adverse clinical outcomes including increases in symptoms and relapse across a broad range of psychiatric diagnoses. Although research supports the concurrent and predictive validity of PC, the measure is not widely used in clinical practice. Here, we describe the construct of PC and review evidence supporting its clinical utility. We then illustrate how criticism and perceptions of criticism can be addressed in a clinical context, describing a family focused treatment approach used with a depressed adolescent at high risk for bipolar disorder.

"PurposeChronic inflammatory disorders of the oral cavity, such as periodontitis, were recently linked to systemic immune activation. Since fungal oral infections have not yet been studied in this respect, the aim of our study is to determine whether the local inflammation caused by oral fungal infection of the palatal tissue (denture stomatitisDS) is associated with the systemic inflammatory response. This question is becoming essential as the population ages. Materials and MethodsPeripheral blood of DS patients (n = 20) and control patients (n = 24) was assessed with flow cytometry to determine lymphocyte and monocyte profiles. Intracellular cytometric analysis was carried out to establish cytokine production by T cells. DS was diagnosed based on clinical symptoms of DS such as swelling and redness of oral mucosa, confirmed by microbiological swabs for fungal colonization with Candida species. The control group was recruited from denture users without clinical and microbiological signs of oral infections. ResultsPercentages of peripheral lymphocytes, T cells, monocytes, and their subpopulations were similar in both studied groups. The exception was median percentages of CD25+ T cell subsets, which were significantly lower in DS patients than in control subjects. This reduction was observed in both CD4 T cell subset (16.7% and 28.1%; p = 0.0006) and CD8 T cell subset (4.6% and 7.0%; p = 0.007) ConclusionsWhile DS and associated local fungal infection do not overtly affect activation of monocytes or lymphocytes, the number of CD 25+ T cells is significantly lower in the DS patients, possibly indicating limited potential for the infection clearance in denture-using aging patients.",126
"Road traffic noise is a widely studied environmental risk factor for ischaemic heart disease and myocardial infarction in particular. Given that myocardial infarction is a leading disability and mortality cause in Bulgaria and that a significant proportion of the urban population is exposed to high noise levels, quantification of the burden of disease attributable to traffic noise is essential for environmental health policy making and noise control engineering. This study aimed at estimating the burden of the myocardial infarction cases attributable to road traffic noise in the Bulgarian urban population. We used the methodology for estimating the burden of disease attributable to environmental noise outlined by the World Health Organization. Risk data were extracted from a recently published meta-analysis providing updated exposureresponse relationship between traffic noise and the risk for myocardial infarction. Based on these data we calculated the fraction of myocardial infarction cases attributable to traffic noise, loss of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and the economic burden, assuming (sic) 12,000 per QALY. About 2.9 % or 101 of all myocardial infarction cases could be attributed to road traffic noise. Fifty-five of these were fatal. Nine hundred and sixty-eight QALYs were lost to these cases. The monetary value of these QALYs was about (sic) 11.6 million. Although the measures used in this study are crude and give only an approximation of the real burden of disease from road traffic noise, they are indicative of the important social and economic aspect of noise pollution in Bulgaria. Hopefully, these results will direct the attention of epidemiologists, environmental hygienists, and health economists to this pivotal environmental issue.",55
"A comprehensive approach to the real-time simulation of power converters using a state-space representation is covered in this paper. Systematic formulations of state-space equations as well as a new switch model are presented. The proposed switch model exhibits a natural switching behavior, which is a valuable characteristic for the real-time simulation of power converters, thereby allowing individual treatment of switching devices irrespective of the converter topology. Successful implementations of the proposed switch model on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) device are reported, with two alternative approaches: 1) precomputing network equations for all switch state combinations and 2) solving network equations on-chip using the Gauss-Seidel iterative method. A two-level three-phase voltage source converter is implemented using the first approach, with a time step of 80 ns and a switching frequency of 200 kHz. Ideal and nonideal boost converters are also implemented on FPGA using the second approach, with a time step of 75 ns and a switching frequency of 20 kHz. Comparison with SPICE models shows that the proposed switch model offers very satisfactory accuracy and precision.",58
"Inflammatory lung disease is one of the most common clinical scenarios, and yet, it is often poorly understood. Inflammatory lung disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, which are causing significant mortality and morbidity, have limited therapeutic options. Recently, new treatments have become available for pulmonary fibrosis. This review article will describe the new insights that are starting to be gained from positron emission tomography (PET) methods, by targeting molecular processes using dedicated radiotracers. Ultimately, this should aid in deriving better pathophysiological classification of these disorders, which will ultimately result in better evaluation of novel therapies.

"Background: Data on the reliability and validity of assessments for irritability, particularly behavioral paradigms, are limited. This study examined the test-retest reliability and validity of a frustration paradigm (the Affective Posner 2 task) and two irritability measures [the Affective Reactivity Index (ARI) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) irritability]. Methods: Participants were 109 youth from a general population sample of twins (aged 9-14 years). Participants completed two visits that were 2-4 weeks apart. At both visits, participants completed the Affective Posner 2 task and self-reported their irritability using the ART. Parents reported their child's irritability using the ARI and completed the CBCL. Results: The Affective Posner 2 task demonstrated good test-retest reliability, with intraclass correlations (ICCs) ranging from .44 to .78. The task effectively evoked negative affect (frustration and unhappiness) at both test and retest, demonstrating its construct validity. Moreover, self-rated frustration and unhappiness during the frustration components of the task correlated positively with self-reported but not parent-reported irritability, providing modest support for convergent validity. Parent- and child-reports of the ARI and parent-reports of the CBCL irritability measure showed excellent test-retest reliability, with ICCs ranging from .88 to .90. Limitations: The sample consists of mostly twins aged 9-14 years from the communities. Thus, results may not generalize to non-twin samples or clinical samples outside of this age range. Conclusions: The Affective Posner 2 paradigm and the ARI and CBCL irritability scales may be useful tools for longitudinal or treatment research on irritability.",115
"The Parents Raising Safe Kids Program (PRSK) is a research-based manualized violence prevention curriculum designed to decrease coercive parenting behavior, encourage positive discipline, increase media violence literacy, and increase child development knowledge. This study is a multi-site pre-post comparison evaluation of PRSK's effectiveness with diverse parents, including those who are incarcerated, in drug treatment and both English and Spanish speaking. Results indicate that PRSK was successful at improving media violence literacy, positive parenting behavior, child development knowledge, anger management, and prosocial problem solving. Additionally, PRSK was especially efficacious for Spanish speaking participants, who improved more than English speakers. Due to the need for appropriate and cost-effective programs for underrepresented groups, these results add to the growing evidence base supporting the use of PRSK with diverse parents. PRSK is effective in educating caregivers about nonviolent parenting behavior and child development. It is flexible, focuses on parents of very young children, and is cost effective. The program costs a fraction of other evidence-based practices yet statistical effect sizes for change over time are comparable. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",74
"We investigated the changes in the expression profiles of the partially resistant apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) cultivar Goldrich following inoculation with Plum pox virus (PPV) using cDNA-amplification fragment length polymorphism, (AFLP). Altered expression patterns were detected and twenty-one differentially expressed cDNA had homologies with genes in databases coding for proteins involved in metabolism, signal transduction, defense, stress and intra/intercellular connections. Seven of the modified expressed patterns were further investigated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR or Northern blotting. The expression patterns of five of these genes were confirmed in the partially resistant P armeniaca cv. 'Goldrich' and assessed in a susceptible genotype. One of these cDNAs, coding for a putative class III chitinase, appeared to be repressed in infected plants of the partially resistant genotype and expressed in the susceptible one which could be related to the partially resistant phenotype. On the contrary, the expression patterns of the genes coding for a transketolase, a kinesin-like and an ankyrin-like protein, were clearly linked to the susceptible interaction. These candidate genes could play a role either in the compatible interaction leading to virus invasion or to the quantitative resistance of apricot to PPV (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

"Background Urban bicycle couriers may have a high incidence of injuries. Most messengers work as contractors and hence their injuries are not well documented. Methods To quantify injury rates and severity among urban bicycle couriers a convenience sample of 113 couriers in the city of Boston completed a two-page self-administered survey. Results Most working couriers have suffered at least one injury resulting either in days lost from work (70%) and in visits to a health-care professional or hospital (55%). The annual incidence rate for injuries resulting in days away from work was 47/100-bike couriers. Bone fractures accounted for the most days lost from work, followed by dislocations, sprains, and strains. Collisions and avoiding collisions with motor vehicles, including being ""doored,"" and collisions with pedestrians accounted for the majority (66%) of events leading to injury. Twenty-four percent of messengers reported wearing a helmet on a regular basis, and 32% have health insurance. Conclusions Urban bicycle messengers are a poorly documented, largely unstudied workforce who suffer a very high rate of occupational injury. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",28
"Communication in construction still depends on a communication network much like the Romans used, face-to-face meetings and paper. Not surprisingly, this situation has been identified as an inhibitor to increasing productivity and a source of miscommunication, rework, and avoidable accidents. This paper will present a holonic construction management (HCM) model allowing the inclusion of multitype holons organized in resource clusters as well as flowing construction material carrying with it critical information. HCM was successfully tested to provide smooth interface between five different types of holons: (1)equipment, (2)human laborer/operator, (3)material, (4)three-dimensional (3D) space, and (5)information/supply logistics. Results also illustrate the potential of the HCM to integrate the many information and communication technology (ICT) applications into a resilient construction environment where electronic designs are turned into physical products. The results of initial site observations as well as safety statistics were used to identify the most important problem areas. Comparative work studies provided the means to measure differences in performance between traditional and HCM-enhanced approaches. The analysis of the field study results highlighted the effectiveness of a key element of HCM, the creation of new communication corridors between previously disconnected production units or holon. The hardware testing under field conditions highlighted the difficulties of embedding modern ICT systems into the rugged environment of construction as well as the human responses to the changes. Finally, the successful realization of HCM for the rebar supply management emphasized the need for a reevaluation of the traditional contractual relationships as the large gains will not benefit all the participants evenly.

"Hydroxyurea (Hu) is widely used as first-line cytoreductive therapy for patients with high-risk Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (Ph-neg MPN), but a small proportion of patients have refractory disease or experience adverse effects. Studies have demonstrated busulfan (Bu) to be an active first-line agent, but data on its role as second-line or later therapy are minimal. To evaluate its efficacy and safety in this context, we undertook a multicenter audit of Ph-neg MPN patients who had received Bu as therapy for Hu intolerance or failure. Of 51 patients identified, 38 (75%) achieved either complete or partial hematological response following at least one Bu cycle. Bu was generally well tolerated, with only 21/135 (15%) cycles complicated by adverse effects, predominantly cytopenia; only 6% of cycles were ceased due to treatment complications. Bu is an effective and well-tolerated agent in patients with Ph-neg MPN in the setting of Hu intolerance or unresponsiveness.",12
"ANUSAT, a micro-satellite developed by Anna University under the overall guidance of ISRO is intended to provide digital communication facilities between a number of universities / colleges and amature satellite radio operators. The thermal design of the satellite poses several challenges mainly because of its lower thermal inertia and power generation. This paper briefs about the thermal design for the ANUSAT, which uses passive thermal control system. No thermal heaters are provided because of the limited power generation. With this thermal design, predicted temperatures are expected to be well within the thermal operating limits. The in-orbit data for the ANUSAT confirms the judicious selection and effectiveness of the thermal control system.",54
Diabetes mellitus and bone metabolism affect mesenchymal tissues and have numerous epidemiological and pathophysiological associations in common. Diabetes mellitus affects bone metabolism and increases fracture risk. The pathophysiological mechanims how type 1 and type 2 diabetes impair bone metabolism and bone strength may differ which is outlined in this review. Direct metabolic effects in additon to centrally controlled endocrine loops exert suppressive effects on bone formation and may also stimulate bone Resorption. Decreased bone formation in combination with increased bone resorption strongly increases fracture risk.,16
"This prospective study aimed to investigate macular structural characteristics in children with Down syndrome compared to those in healthy children. Two groups of children (aged 6-16 years) were enrolled: children with Down syndrome (Down syndrome group, N = 17) and age-matched healthy children who were full-term at birth (control group, N = 18). Eligible patients had visual acuity of 20/100 or better and gestational age at birth of a parts per thousand yen 36 weeks. Fourier domain optical coherence tomography was used for imaging of the macular retinal structure, and retinal volume scans centered on the macula were obtained. Central subfield thickness (CST) and the thickness of the inner and outer retinal layer regions were analyzed using the instrument's segmentation software. The analysis of data is provided for the right eye only, since there was no significant difference between right and left eyes for either the Down syndrome or control groups. Children in the Down syndrome group generally had identifiable retinal structure. The CST for the full retina and inner and outer retinal layers were all significantly greater in the Down syndrome group than the control group (independent t test, all p < 0.05). Despite the significantly thicker macula, only about 29 % (5 of 17) of the right eyes of patients with Down syndrome had macular thickness outside the normal range. Visual acuity in the Down syndrome group was not directly correlated with increased CST (t = 1.288, r = 0.326, p = 0.202). On average, CST in the Down syndrome group was greater than that in the control group, suggesting abnormal macular development in children with Down syndrome.",116
"The dynamic nature of a river channel entrance is commonly seasonal dependant. This is evidenced in the topography of river channel entrances in East Coast of Borneo which is influenced by both North East (NE) and South West (SW) monsoons on top of surrounding parameters such as waves and tides, sedimentatidn as well as climate change. Advanced numerical modelling technique is frequently used as a leading approach to investigate the complicated nature of river channel entrance to well represent actual conditions of a designated area. This paper presented a mesoscale numerical modelling method by integrating reductionist and reduced complexity model approach along with local seasonal conditions to well represent river channel entrance problem and propose management measures. The model was established with a set of numerical equilibrium equations and calibrated parameters to reflect the features of regional conditions with the combination of local validated modelling parameters. The model had accurately represented the effects of both NE and SW monsoons in terms of hydraulics and sediment dynamics at the Petagas river channel entrance, as verified by site data and satellite imagery. In addition, the accuracy of the model provides confidence in the implementation of improvement measures at the river channel entrance. The improvement scheme includes a training channel and a breakwater in improving flushing capacity, thus preventing sedimentation and upstream flooding, allowing proper navigation through the river. In conclusion, the accurate investigational result from this numerical model had successfully demonstrated its scientific role in solving dynamic river channel entrance, which can serve as a numerical modelling approach for solving similar river channel entrance problems especially in the East Coast of Borneo with predominant inter-annual seasonal variations.

"The present study investigates the accuracy of five different data-driven techniques in estimating oxygen transfer efficiency in baffled chutes: feedforward neural network (FFNN), radial basis neural network (RBNN), generalized regression neural network (GRNN), adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system with subtractive clustering (ANFIS-SC), and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system with fuzzy c-means clustering (ANFIS-FCM). Baffled apron chutes or drops are used on channel structures to dissipate the energy in the flow. A baffled chute design is effective both in energy dissipation and in aerating the flow and reducing nitrogen supersaturation. There is a close relationship between energy dissipation and oxygen transfer efficiency. This study aims to determine the aeration efficiency of baffled chutes with stepped (S), wedge (W), trapezoidal (T), and T-shaped (T-S) baffle blocks. The performances of the FFNN, RBNN, GRNN, ANFIS-SC, and ANFIS-FCM models are compared with those of multilinear and nonlinear regression models. Based on the comparisons, it was observed that all data-driven models could be successfully employed in modeling the aeration efficiency of S, W, and T-S baffle blocks from the available experimental data. Among data-driven models, the FFNN model was found to be the best. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.",83
"Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) are characterized by the presence of chronically inflamed skin lesions containing malignant T cells. Early disease presents as limited skin patches or plaques and exhibits an indolent behavior. For many patients, the disease never progresses beyond this stage, but in approximately one third of patients, the disease becomes progressive, and the skin lesions start to expand and evolve. Eventually, overt tumors develop and the malignant T cells may disseminate to the blood, lymph nodes, bone marrow, and visceral organs, often with a fatal outcome. The transition from early indolent to progressive and advanced disease is accompanied by a significant shift in the nature of the tumor-associated inflammation. This shift does not appear to be an epiphenomenon but rather a critical step in disease progression. Emerging evidence supports that the malignant T cells take control of the inflammatory environment, suppressing cellular immunity and anti-tumor responses while promoting a chronic inflammatory milieu that fuels their own expansion. Here, we review the inflammatory changes associated with disease progression in CTCL and point to their wider relevance in other cancer contexts. We further define the term ""malignant inflammation"" as a pro-tumorigenic inflammatory environment orchestrated by the tumor cells and discuss some of the mechanisms driving the development of malignant inflammation in CTCL.",7
"Mucormycosis is a lethal opportunistic fungal infection, described mostly in immunocompromised patients. A comparative cohort study was conducted to compare the evolution of the study group patients with rhino-orbital mucormycosis, in which a therapeutic protocol was instituted, in which the pterygomaxillary fossa is systematically surgically approached and orbital exenteration is performed or not based on the spreading of the infection to the orbital apex or the orbital fissure, with a historical group where these criteria were not applied. Fifteen cases were included, eight in historic group A and seven in the study group B. Medical treatment was provided with control of the underlying disease (amphotericin B and low molecular weight heparin) as well as surgical treatment with extensive debridement including endoscopic ethmoidectomy and exploration of the pterygomaxillary fossa, also performing orbital exenteration only in patients who presented orbital apex syndrome in group B. In group A, there was a mortality rate of 50%, in group B all patients were clinical cured; however, the two patients with hematologic diseases died of complications not related to the fungal infection. With the standardization of a diagnostic and therapeutic protocol, good results in healing and survival of patients can be obtained.",126
"Study Design. Analysis of a combined prospective dataset. Objective. To compare clinical outcomes in patients with and without preexisting depression or bipolar disorder undergoing surgery for degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM). Summary of Background Data. Psychiatric comorbidities, including depression, have been associated with worse clinical outcomes after lumbar spine surgery; however, it is unclear whether these psychiatric disorders are also predictive of outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for the treatment of DCM. Methods. Four hundred and one patients with symptomatic DCM were enrolled in the prospective AOSpine International or North America study at twelve North American sites. Patients were evaluated preoperatively and at 6, 12, and 24 months using the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association scale (mJOA), Nurick score, Neck Disability Index (NDI), and Short-Form 36v2 (SF-36v2) Health Survey. A mixed model analytic approach was used to evaluate differences in outcomes at 24 months among patients with and without psychiatric disorders, while controlling for relevant baseline characteristics and surgical factors. Results. Ninety-seven patients (24.19%) were diagnosed with preexisting depression or bipolar disorder. There were more females (65.98%) with these psychiatric disorders than males (34.02%) (P< 0.0001). Patients with psychiatric comorbidities were more likely to have cardiovascular (P = 0.0177), respiratory (P < 0.0001), gastrointestinal (P < 0.0001), rheumatologic (P = 0.0109), and neurologic (P = 0.0309) disorders. At 24 months after surgery, patients in both groups demonstrated significant improvements on the mJOA, Nurick, NDI, and SF-36v2 Physical Component Score (PCS). Patients with depression or bipolar disorder, however, did not exhibit a significant or clinically important change on the SF-36v2 Mental Component Score (MCS). There were no differences in mJOA and Nurick scores at 24 months among patients in each group. Improvement in NDI, SF-36v2 PCS, and MCS, however, were smaller in patients with depression or bipolar disorder than those without. Conclusion. Patients with depression or bipolar disorder have smaller functional and quality of life improvements after surgery compared to patients without psychiatric comorbidities.",115
The main focus of this paper is on two-dimensional (2-D) analog filtering. The development of the bivariate and bifrequency theory for autonomous dynamic systems and circuits are reviewed. The two-dimensional Laplace transform techniques make it possible to characterize a large class of analytic systems and analog linear time-varying systems and circuits. The bifrequency theory and corresponding analysis techniques are outlined. Contents of existing literature are complemented more than duplicated.,52
"Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) is endogenously produced in vascular tissue and has anti-oxidant and vasoprotective properties. This study investigates whether chronic treatment using the fast H2S donor NaHS could elicit a vasoprotective effect in diabetes. Diabetes was induced in male C57BL6/J mice with streptozotocin (60mg/kg daily, ip for 2weeks) and confirmed by elevated blood glucose and glycated haemoglobin levels. Diabetic mice were then treated with NaHS (100 mu mol/kg/day) for 4weeks, and aortae collected for functional and biochemical analyses. In the diabetic group, both endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation and basal nitric oxide (NO center dot) bioactivity were significantly reduced (p<0.05), and maximal vasorelaxation to the NO center dot donor sodium nitroprusside was impaired (p<0.05) in aorta compared to control mice. Vascular superoxide generation via nicotine adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (p<0.05) was elevated in aorta from diabetic mice which was associated with increased expression of NOX2 (p<0.05). NaHS treatment of diabetic mice restored endothelial function and exogenous NO center dot efficacy back to control levels. NaHS treatment also reduced the diabetes-induced increase in NADPH oxidase activity, but did not affect NOX2 protein expression. These data show that chronic NaHS treatment reverses diabetes-induced vascular dysfunction by restoring NO center dot efficacy and reducing superoxide production in the mouse aorta.",120
"In this paper, two techniques based on Q-learning and action dependent heuristic dynamic programming (ADHDP) are demonstrated for the demand-side management of domestic electric water heaters (DEWHs). The problem is modeled as a dynamic programming problem, with the state space defined by the temperature of output water, the instantaneous hot water consumption rate, and the estimated grid load. According to simulation, Q-learning and ADHDP reduce the cost of energy consumed by DEWHs by approximately 26% and 21%, respectively. The simulation results also indicate that these techniques will minimize the energy consumed during load peak periods. As a result, the customers saved about $466 and $367 annually by using Q-learning and ADHDP techniques to control their DEWHs (100 gallons tank size) operation, which is better than the cost reduction that resulted from using the state-of-the-art ($246) control technique under the same simulation parameters. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work that uses the approximate dynamic programming techniques to solve the DEWH's load management problem.",1
"RPE65 is a key metalloenzyme responsible for maintaining visual function in vertebrates. Despite extensive research on this membrane-bound retinoid isomerase, fundamental questions regarding its enzymology remain unanswered. Here, we report the crystal structure of RPE65 in a membrane-like environment. These crystals, obtained from enzymatically active, nondelipidated protein, displayed an unusual packing arrangement wherein RPE65 is embedded in a lipid-detergent sheet. Structural differences between delipidated and nondelipidated RPE65 uncovered key residues involved in substrate uptake and processing. Complementary iron K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy data established that RPE65 as isolated contained a divalent iron center and demonstrated the presence of a tightly bound ligand consistent with a coordinated carboxylate group. These results support the hypothesis that the Lewis acidity of iron could be used to promote ester dissociation and generation of a carbocation intermediate required for retinoid isomerization.",36
"ObjectiveQuinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) is a seed crop rich in bioactive compounds including phytoecdysones (especially 20-hydroxyecdysone, 20HE), polyphenols, proteins and essential fatty acids. We previously reported a method to leach and concentrate quinoa bioactives into a complex phytochemical mixture termed quinoa leachate (QL). Here, we aimed to determine the effect of QL and its chemically distinct fractions on five biochemical endpoints relevant to skin care applications: (i) cell viability, (ii) matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) mRNA expression, (iii) MMP enzymatic activity, (iv) tyrosinase enzymatic activity and (v) intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. MethodsQuinoa leachate was fractionated and chemically characterized using column chromatography and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Cell viability was determined using a MTT assay in four mammalian cell lines. MMP-1 mRNA expression was assessed in human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) via qRT-PCR. The enzymatic activity of MMP-9 and tyrosinase was measured using fluorometric and colorimetric in vitro assays, respectively. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ROS production was determined in human dermal fibroblasts by fluorescence intensity of an oxidant-sensitive probe. ResultsQuinoa leachate was separated into three fractions: (i) carbohydrate-rich fraction (QL-C; 71.3% w/w of QL); (ii) phytoecdysone, polyphenol and protein-rich fraction (QL-P, 13.3% w/w of QL); (iii) oil-rich fraction (QL-O, 10.8% w/w of QL). QL did not reduce cell viability in any of the four cell lines tested. QL, QL-P and QL-O each significantly inhibited MMP-1 mRNA expression in HDF at a concentration of 5gmL(-1). QL and QL-P also significantly inhibited MMP-9 enzymatic activity, whereas QL-P demonstrated significant tyrosinase enzymatic inhibition. Furthermore, QL, QL-P, QL-O and 20HE significantly inhibited intracellular ROS production. ConclusionThis study is the first to demonstrate the MMP, tyrosinase and ROS inhibiting properties of multiple different phytochemical components derived from quinoa seeds. Our work indicates that quinoa phytochemicals may play a role in the treatment and prevention of skin ageing through a multiplicity of effects.",114
"Medical procedures often induce physical pain and psychological distress. Cancer patients are particularly vulnerable to fatigue, heightened emotional distress, social isolation, and increased risk of depression, severely reducing quality of life and potential treatment non-adherence and prolonged hospital stays. Leveraging emerging virtual reality (VR) technology, we prototyped Serenity: a mobile smartphone-based VR cancer coping intervention informed by distraction therapy to help alleviate the symptoms of coping and promote patient empowerment. It leverages emerging low-cost VR to improve accessibility and effectiveness of distraction therapy. We describe the results of a preliminary usability study and lessons learned that apply to future design and evaluation of virtual reality interventions for behavioral health.",29
"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common form of leukemia in adults in the Western hemisphere. Tumor-specific chromosomal translocations, characteristic findings in several human malignancies that directly lead to malignant transformation, have not been identified in CLL. Using paired-end transcriptome sequencing, we identified recurrent and reciprocal RNA chimeras involving yippee like 5 (YPEL5) and serine/threonine-protein phosphatase PP1-beta-catalytic subunit (PPP1CB) in CLL. Two of seven index cases (28%) harbored the reciprocal RNA chimeras in our initial screening. Using quantitative real-time PCR (q real-time PCR), YPEL5/PPP1CB and PPP1CB/YPEL5 fusion transcripts were detected in 97 of 103 CLL samples (95%) but not in paired normal samples, benign lymphocytes, or various unrelated cancers. Whole-genome sequencing and Southern blotting demonstrated no evidence for a genomic fusion between YPEL5 and PPP1CB. YPEL5/PPP1CB chimera, when introduced into mammalian cells, expressed a truncated PPP1CB protein that demonstrated diminished phosphatase activity. PPP1CB silencing resulted in enhanced proliferation and colony formation of MEC1 and JVM3 cells, implying a role in the pathogenesis of mature B-cell leukemia. These studies uncover a potential role for recurrent RNA chimeras involving phosphatases in the pathogenesis of a common form of leukemia.",39
"Background Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant multisystem disease caused by abnormal expansion of cytosine-thynnine-guanine (CTG) repeats in the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase gene. The clinical manifestations of DM1 are multisystemic and highly variable, and the unstable nature of CTG expansion causes wide genotypic and phenotypic presentations, which make molecular methods essential for the diagnosis. So far, very few studies about molecular diagnosis in Chinese patients with DM1 have been reported. Therefore, we carried out a study using two different methods in molecular diagnosis to verify the validity in detecting CTG expansion in Chinese patients showing DM signs. Methods A total of 97 Chinese individuals were referred for molecular diagnosis of DM1 using conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) accompanied by Southern blotting and triplet primed PCR (TP-PCR). We evaluated the sensitivity and limitation of each method using percentage. Results By conventional PCR 65 samples showed only one fragment corresponding to the normal allele and 62 out of them were correctly diagnosed as DM1 by TP-PCR and three homologous non-DM1 samples were ruled out; Southern blotting analysis successfully made 13 out of 16 correct diagnoses with a more sensitivity using alpha-P-32-labeled probes than dig-labeled probes. Conclusion Molecular analysis is necessary for the diagnosis of DM1 and TP-PCR is a reliable, sensitive, and easily performed method in molecular diagnosis which is worthy to be popularized.",39
"Herbal medicines have long been used to treat Parkinson's disease (PD). To systematically analyze the anti-parkinsonian activity of echinacoside (ECH) in a neurotoxic model of PD and provide a future basis for basic and clinical investigations, male C57BL/6 mice were randomized into blank control, PD model and ECH-administration groups. ECH significantly suppressed the dopaminergic neuron loss (P<0.01) caused by MPTP and maintained dopamine content (P<0.01) and dopamine metabolite content (P<0.05) compared with that measured in mice with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced damage. Additionally, ECH inhibited the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the substantia nigra, which suggested the involvement of neuroinflammation. The relevant cytokines were detected with a Proteome Profiler Array, which confirmed that ECH participated in the regulation of seven cytokines. Given that p38 mitogenactivated protein kinase (p38MAPK) and NF-kappaB (NF-kappa B) signals are considered to be closely related to neuroninflammation, the gene expression levels of p38MAPK and six NF-kappa B DNA-binding subunits were assessed. Western blotting analysis showed that both p38MAPK and the NF-kappa B p52 subunit were upregulated in the MPTP group and that ECH downregulated their expressions. Minocycline was administered as the positive control to inhibit neuroinflammation, and no differences were detected between the minocycline-and ECH-mediated inhibition of the p38MAPK and NF-kappa B p52 signals. In conclusion, echinacoside is a potential novel orally active compound for regulating neuroinflammation and related signals in Parkinson's disease and may provide a new prospect for clinical treatment.",19
"Hybrid electrical vehicles (HEVs) are able to improve the fuel economy with reduced emissions due to their effective power management and regenerative power utilization. However, developing an optimal supervisory control strategy to distribute power is quite challenging due to the high degrees of freedom introduced by the multiple power sources in HEVs. Conventional approach uses so-called power follower scheme, and the power management can also be achieved by minimizing the equivalent fuel consumption at each given instant without guaranteeing that the battery state of charge (SOC) maintains at its target level. This paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC) strategy based on the linear quadratic tracking (LQT) control to follow the predicted driver power demand over a given horizon while keeping the battery SOC operated at its target level. The LQT controller is developed based upon the linearized control-oriented model and used to optimally track the predicted desired torque trajectory by minimizing the total equivalent fuel consumption of the internal combustion (IC) engine and electric motor (EM) over a given finite prediction horizon at each operational point. The performance of the MPC based LQT controller is validated in simulations under four typical driving cycles. The simulation results show that the fuel economy is greatly improved over the baseline power follower control strategy especially under FTP and IM240 driving cycles, and at the same time the battery state of charge is maintained at the desired level.",53
"Aircrafts employing Stealth Technology acclimatizes itself to the enemy's hostile environment by being invisible to the enemy's detection system. Though, Stealth technologies are of different kinds, technology involved in body designing of an Aircraft forms the foremost & most preferred method. Body Designing involves alteration of body surfaces to form inclinations, edges causing uneven area to make the incident electromagnetic wave from RADAR to scatter in multi-direction from the object. This reduces the intensity of the reflected wave moving towards the source or the receiver. By, improvising the surface so as to reduce intensity of the reflected wave towards receiver lessen Radar Cross Section of that plane, lesser the Radar Cross Section, aircraft is less detectable in enemy RADAR. This paper presents the experimental results of such fabricated object which are at different angles to the antenna along with the explanation of some uncertain behaviour of reflected wave from fabricated object. The result is then related with Radar Cross Section of an object.",98
"Ageing of the central nervous system (CNS) is the major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a type of neurodegeneration that is associated with deficits in cognition and memory and clinically manifested as severe senile dementia. Numerous mental processes underline cognition, including attention, producing and understanding language, learning, reasoning, problem solving, decision making and memory formation. In the past, neurones or their parts have been considered to be the exclusive cellular sites of memory and cognitive processes. However, it has become evident that astrocytes, the major homeostatic glial cell of the CNS, provide an essential contribution to memory formation, and astroglial failure may promote cognitive decline in AD. In response to the network reset mechanisms mediated by the noradrenergic projections of neurones located in the locus coeruleus, astrocytes get excited and participate in the morphological remodelling associated with synaptic plasticity, otherwise thought to represent a cellular mechanism of learning and memory. Astroglial morphological plasticity is an energy-demanding process requiring mobilisation of glycogen, which, in the CNS, is almost exclusively stored in astrocytes. Astroglia exhibit cytoplasmic excitability that engages ions (such as Ca2+ and Na+) and second messengers (such as cAMP). These ions/molecules contribute to the reception of extracellular signals and coordinate the secretion of glio-signalling molecules, including peptides such as apolipoporotein E, which participates in lipid transport between glia and neurones. In this setting, astrocytes are positioned as spatio-temporal integrators of neural network coordination, which disintegrates during progression of AD. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",81
"Background Adrenaline auto-injectors (AAI) should be provided to individuals considered to be at high risk of anaphylaxis. There is some evidence that the rate of AAI prescription is increasing, but the true extent has not been previously quantified. Aim To estimate the trends in annual GP-issued prescriptions for AAI among UK children between 2000 and 2012. Design and setting Retrospective cohort study using data from primary care practices that contributed to The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database. Method Children and young people aged between 0-17 years of age with a prescription for AAIs were identified, and annual AAI device prescription rates were estimated using Stata (version 12). Results A total of 1.06 million UK children were identified, providing 5.1 million person years of follow-up data. Overall, 23 837 children were deemed high risk by their GPs, and were prescribed 98 737 AAI devices. This equates to 4.67 children (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.66 to 4.69), and 19.4 (95% CI = 19.2 to 19.5) devices per 1000 person years. Between 2000 and 2012, there has been a 355% increase in the number of children prescribed devices, and a 506% increase in the total number of AAI devices prescribed per 1000 person years in the UK. The number of devices issued per high-risk child during this period has also increased by 33%. Conclusion The number of children being prescribed AAI devices and the number of devices being prescribed in UK primary care between 2000 and 2012 has significantly increased. A discussion to promote rational prescribing of AAIs in the NHS is needed.",33
"Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is one of the most common peripheral T-cell lymphomas, and the incidence is higher in blacks than non-Hispanic whites. ALK-positive and ALK-negative ALCL are distinct subtypes that have different characteristics and clinical outcomes. Breast implant associated ALCL is a rare lymphoma that has a good survival outcome, and a recent study showed that total capsulectomy is essential for treatment. Brentuximab vedotin (BV) is a standard treatment for relapsed/refractory ALCL. The response rate is high at 80-90%; however, once the disease progresses in patients on BV, survival outcome is very poor, with a median overall survival of less than two months.",7
"Research about the impact of the CEO's personality on firm-level outcomes has been ambiguous, partly because the underlying mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Given that the individuals most strongly influenced by a firm's CEO are the top management team (TMT) members, this study focuses on the CEO-TMT interface as a salient intervening relationship. We hypothesize that CEO personality traits of extraversion and openness to experience would influence firm performance indirectly through TMT behavioral integration (TMT teamness). Using multisource survey data from 138 small- to medium-sized firms, we test and find general support for a mediation model in which the CEO's personality traits are positively related to TMT behavioral integration, which, in turn, enhances firm performance. Limitations and implications for future research are also discussed.",66
"The arrival of the information age has gradually expanded the practical application of computer networks, provided more convenience for people's lives, and promoted the rapid development of Chinese information industry. In this situation, the process of using computer network has gradually produced network security problems, affected the security of the user's personal information. Affected by various illegal attacks will bury a large security risks to popularization and use of computer network, indirectly reduce the efficiency of a variety of information security transmission, restrict the future level of network services.

"The collection, storage, management, and anticipation of contextual information about the user to support decision-making constitute some of the key operations in most Ambient Intelligent (AmI) systems. When the instructor has a computer-based class it is often difficult to confirm if the students are working in the proposed activities. In order to mitigate problems that might occur in an environment with learning technologies we suggest an AmI system aimed at capturing, measuring, and supervising the students' level of attentiveness in real scenarios and dynamically provide recommendations to the instructor. With this system it is possible to assess both individual and group attention, in real-time, providing a measure of the level of engagement of each student in the proposed activities and allowing the instructor to better steer teaching methodologies.",92

"While co-locating virtual machines improves utilization in resource shared environments, the resulting performance interference between VMs is difficult to model or predict. QoS sensitive applications can suffer from resource co-location with other less short-term resource sensitive or batch applications. The common practice of overprovisioning resources helps to avoid performance interference and guarantee QoS but leads to low machine utilization. Recent work that relies on static approaches suffer from practical limitations due to assumptions such as a priori knowledge of application behaviour and workload. To address these limitations, we present Stay-Away, a generic and adaptive mechanism to mitigate the detrimental effects of performance interference on sensitive applications when co-located with batch applications. Our mechanism complements the allocation decisions of resource schedulers by continuously learning the favourable and unfavourable states of co-execution and mapping them to a state-space representation. Trajectories in this representation are used to predict and prevent any transition towards interference of sensitive applications by proactively throttling the execution of batch applications. The representation also doubles as a template to prevent violations in the future execution of the repeatable sensitive application when co-located with other batch applications. Experimental results with realistic applications show that it is possible to guarantee a high level of QoS for latency sensitive applications while also improving machine utilization.",58

"Objective: To identify factors contributing to the occurrence of unintended pregnancies after Essure sterilization in the Netherlands. Even though Essure is a permanent method of contraception, unintended pregnancies have been reported. Design: Retrospective case series analysis. Setting: Not applicable. Patient(s): Thirty-five pregnancies were reported in the Netherlands after Essure sterilization from 2002 through 2014 out of 27,346 placements. Intervention(s): Data regarding Essure placement procedure, confirmation tests, and pregnancy outcome of the reported cases were obtained and analyzed to identify a possible cause of failure. Main Outcome Measure(s): Four causes of failure were identified: perforation (n = 10), expulsion (n = 7), unilateral placement (n = 7), and luteal pregnancy (n = 2). Result(s): The occurrence of most pregnancies was related to physician noncompliance (n = 14). The other cases were associated with patient noncompliance (n = 5) or misinterpretation of the confirmation test (n = 9). Most pregnancies occurred within the first 24 months after the 3-month confirmation test (n = 23). Conclusion(s): The results of this study show that the incidence of pregnancies after Essure sterilization is low. Most pregnancies were related to incorrect positioning of a device or unilateral placement, and seem therefore preventable. Unilateral placement without prior history of salpingectomy should always be considered as unsuccessful sterilization. Furthermore, interpretation of the confirmation tests should be done by trained physicians, and with caution. We want to emphasize the importance of strictly adhering to placement and follow-up protocols. (C) 2016 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.",116
"Flow patterns around bodies undergoing flow-induced vibrations and biomimetic flows have intriguing similarities, and similar flow mechanisms can be used to understand their principal properties and find ways to alter their behavior. The long history and extensive study of flow-structure interaction allowed the rapid development of the new field of biomimetic fluid mechanics.

"Trichloroethylene (TCE) and other solvents are found as groundwater contaminants in industrial complexes. Pump-andtreat (PAT) systems are commonly selected for remediation, but have the disadvantages of long operation time and high cost. To reduce the remediation time and cost of PAT systems, a cost-effective optimal design was obtained with a simulation-optimization model. MODFLOW and MT3DMS were used for simulating groundwater flow and contaminant transport. A genetic algorithm was used for optimization, and a parallel computing technique was used for faster optimization. Cost-effective optimal design was achieved using two objective functions, which calculated the total remediation cost by means of installation, operational, and maintenance costs. Based on the restrictions in the study area, two remediation scenarios were examined. Scenario 1 involved the removal of TCE, and Scenario 2 involved the containment of TCE within the compliance line. The total remediation costs of scenario 2 were 77.490.4% of scenario 1. The remediation time decreased from 9.87 years in scenario 1 to 8.13 years in scenario 2. Sensitivity analysis determined the effects of installation, operational, and maintenance costs on the total remediation cost, showing that optimal total cost and remediation time were most affected by operational cost. A parallel computing technique using 40 networked slave processes increased optimization speed by 16.9 times. However, the efficiency of the parallel computing technique decreased as networking time increased.",101
"Prior reviews of behavioral treatments for individuals with comorbid alcohol and drug use disorders (substance use disorder SUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have not systematically considered whether comparison conditions are matched to target treatments on time and attention. A systematic literature search using PubMed MESH terms for alcohol and substance use disorders, PTSD, and treatment identified relevant behavioral randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that evaluated PTSD-oriented exposure-based treatments, addiction-focused treatments, and coping-based treatments that do not involve exposure to trauma memories. Information pertaining to within-subject changes over time and between-subject differences, quality of control condition, recruitment efficiency, and assessment and treatment retention was synthesized. Alcohol and drug outcomes were described separately when possible. Twenty-four behavioral RCTs were identified: 7 exposure based, 6 addiction focused, and 11 coping based. Seven studies included SUD intervention comparison conditions matched to the target intervention on time and attention. Most of the 24 studies found that participants in both the experimental and control conditions improved significantly over time on SUD and PTSD outcomes. No study found significant between-group differences in both SUD and PTSD outcomes favoring the experimental treatment. Despite greater treatment dropout, there was greater improvement in some PTSD outcomes for exposure-based interventions than the control conditions, including when the control conditions were matched for time and attention. Addiction-focused and coping-based interventions did not generally show an advantage over comparably robust controls, although some coping-based interventions yielded better drug use outcomes than control conditions. When available, interventions that integrate exposure-based PTSD treatment and behavioral SUD treatment are recommended as they are associated with better PTSD outcomes than SUD care matched for time and attention. However, the results of this critical review also suggest that people with SUD/PTSD can benefit from a variety of treatment options, including standard SUD care.",104
"The study was conducted to evaluate continued maintenance of the efficacy and safety of therapy by switching to subcutaneous golimumab (GLM-SC) in rheumatoid arthritis patients with low disease activity or remission who previously received a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor. Thirty patients who had been treated with etanercept or infliximab were switched to GLM-SC in maintaining disease activity at a low level. The patients were divided into two groups through discussion with each patient, considering general condition and convenience: the low disease activity (LDA) group and the LDAq8w group, which included patients with low disease activity or remission who switched to 50 mg GLM therapy at 4- and 8-week intervals, respectively. The effects of the TNF inhibitors to GLM-SC switch were evaluated at 12, 24, and 52 weeks after switching. The mean DAS28-ESR and DAS-CRP values in the LDA groups (16 patients) and LDAq8w groups (14 patients) were maintained from baseline throughout the 52-week treatment period. DAS28-ESR remission (93.8 and 92.3%) rates were also maintained through week 52 from the baseline remission rate (75.0 and 78.6%) in the LDA and LDAq8w groups, respectively. Thus, both GLM-SC treatment regimens were effective in maintaining the clinical response achieved with LDA secondary to TNF inhibitors. No serious adverse events occurred, and the continuation rate at 52 weeks was 100% in both groups. Therapeutic efficacy is adequately maintained in most patients switching from TNF inhibitor to GLM-SC (50 mg/4-8 weeks). Patients receiving TNF inhibitor can seamlessly switch to GLM-SC without serious safety concerns.",23

"Many cities around the world have reached a critical situation when it comes to energy and water supply, threatening the urban sustainable development. From an engineering and architecture perspective it is mandatory to design cities taking into account energy and water issues to achieve high living and sustainability standards. The aim of this paper is to develop an optimization model for the planning of residential urban districts with special consideration of renewables and water harvesting integration. The optimization model is multi-objective which uses a genetic algorithm to minimize the system life cycle costs, and maximize renewables and water harvesting reliability through dynamic simulations. The developed model can be used for spatial optimization design of new urban districts. It can also be employed for analyzing the performances of existing urban districts under an energy-water-economic viewpoint. The optimization results show that the reliability of the hybrid renewables based power system can vary between 40 and 95% depending on the scenarios considered regarding the built environment area and on the cases concerning the overall electric load. The levelized cost of electricity vary between 0.096 and 0.212 $/kW h. The maximum water harvesting system reliability vary between 30% and 100% depending on the built environment area distribution. For reliabilities below 20% the levelized cost of water is kept below 1 $/m(3) making competitive with the network water tariff. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",43
"This article argues that news coverage plays an important role for national identity building in the way that it evaluates the own nation better than foreign nations (in-group/out-group bias). This notion is being transferred to the media as an element of national cultural identity. This article identifies analogies between national identity building through the mass media and the third-person perception, which states that people assume others to be more vulnerable to negative media influences. It is hypothesized that patterns of an international third-person perception occur in news coverage, i.e. the news media should present media influences in the own country to be weaker than in other countries. A first standardized content analysis (N = 2204) of newspaper coverage from the US and Germany on elections in own and other countries supports this hypothesis. Consequences are discussed and directions for future research are pointed out.",63
"This paper presents an evolutionary optimal fuzzy system with information fusion of heterogeneous distributed computing and polar-space dynamic model for online motion control of Swedish redundant robots. The intelligent fuzzy system incorporated with the parallel metaheuristic Bacteria Foraging Optimization (BFO)Artificial Immune System (AIS), called FS-PBFOAIS and its field-programmable gate array (FPGA) realization to optimal polar-space online motion control of four-wheeled redundant mobile robots.

"Simulating the nonlinear behavior of complex systems requires significant computational effort. Despite the rapid progress in computing technology, the demand is still strong for more efficient simulation methods in diverse structural dynamics fields such as nonlinear system identification and nonlinear system reliability. In addition to efficiency, algorithmic stability and accuracy must be addressed in the development of new simulation procedures. In this paper, a method to treat localized nonlinearities in a structure efficiently and accurately is proposed. The method is conditionally stable. The system equations are separated into a state-invariant linear part and a state-dependent nonlinear part that is considered to be external pseudo-forces that act on the linear system. The response of the system is obtained by fixed point iterations in which the pseudo-forces are updated until convergence. In addition to the one time-step-ahead prediction form, the novel idea of multiple time-step-ahead prediction is proposed. The effect of this approach is investigated and shown to increase algorithm efficiency and stability. To perform the numerical integration, time-stepping schemes like the exponential first-order hold method can be used to the advantage of efficiency and accuracy. To increase the accuracy and stability of the method, a novel second-order hold equivalent is derived and implemented. The efficiency, stability, and accuracy of the method are demonstrated in numerical examples. Finally, the method is applied to the earthquake-induced motion of a 20-story building with local nonlinearities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",49
"We propose a new rule, loop reversal, in block diagram and signal flow graph manipulation (or transformation) that leads to equivalent block diagrams or signal flow graphs from existing ones. It is known that ""algebraic loops"" can exist in some systems, where different choices of causality end up with different yet equivalent block diagrams or signal flow graphs, in which some are loop reversed versions of others. However, to the author's knowledge, loop reversal has not been discussed in the context of block diagram or signal flow graph manipulation, and is still missing from textbooks teaching this topic.",56
"In spite of excellent properties of supercritical CO2 in enzyme catalyzed reactions, destabilizing effects of CO2 molecules on the enzyme structure limits the industrial applications of this green solvent in the field of biocatalysis. Here, based on the substantial role of charged surface residues such as lysines in enzyme inactivation, we introduced for the first time, Post Translational Modifications (PTMs), a famous concept in molecular biology, as a protein stabilization strategy in supercritical condition. Lysine groups were modified using PTM templates to find out more about the exact mechanism of enzyme inactivation in supercritical CO2 and to explore a new way for protein stabilization in this solvent. We used MD simulation as common tool for in situ examining enzyme structure in supercritical fluids, for the investigation of structural consequence of modifications. Different modifications including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and carboxylation have been applied on the model enzyme. For comparison to CALB structure in supercritical CO2, the acetylated enzyme was also simulated in aqueous solvent at 300 and 353 K. Interestingly, acetylation of lysine residues prevents enzyme from denaturation at high temperatures in water, which is in agreement with experimental observation in aqueous solution. However, acetylation is not so useful for stabilization of enzyme in supercritical CO2. In contrast, methylation and carboxylation efficiently stabilize enzyme in supercritical CO2. Phosphate groups in phosphorylated lysines destabilize enzyme by formation of excess hydrogen bonds by inappropriate groups and perturb enzyme conformation. Moreover, it was found that modification of surface arginine residues was not so satisfactory in stabilization of the enzyme. This finding supports the mechanism of lipase inactivation through direct interaction of CO2 molecules on lysine residues and formation of carbamates. We think this new exploration can open new window for developing enzyme catalyzed mechanism of enzyme inactivation in scCO(2). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",30
"Solving large-scale all-to-all comparison problems using distributed computing is increasingly significant for various applications. Previous efforts to implement distributed all-to-all comparison frameworks have treated the two phases of data distribution and comparison task scheduling separately. This leads to high storage demands as well as poor data locality for the comparison tasks, thus creating a need to redistribute the data at runtime. Furthermore, most previous methods have been developed for homogeneous computing environments, so their overall performance is degraded even further when they are used in heterogeneous distributed systems. To tackle these challenges, this paper presents a data aware task scheduling approach for solving all-to-all comparison problems in heterogeneous distributed systems. The approach formulates the requirements for data distribution and comparison task scheduling simultaneously as a constrained optimization problem. Then, metaheuristic data pre-scheduling and dynamic task scheduling strategies are developed along with an algorithmic implementation to solve the problem. The approach provides perfect data locality for all comparison tasks, avoiding rearrangement of data at runtime. It achieves load balancing among heterogeneous computing nodes, thus enhancing the overall computation time. It also reduces data storage requirements across the network. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through experimental studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2
"A female, captive bred, juvenile swell shark (Cephaloscyllium ventriosum) was observed swimming in tight circles and rolling. Radiographs and computed tomography of this individual revealed extensive cartilage mineralization of the skull and cranial cervical vertebrae compared with diagnostic images of clinically healthy conspecifics. Gross necropsy and histopathologic examination revealed ossification and fibrosis of the cartilaginous matrix of the skull and cervical vertebrae with deep invasion by a pigmented hyphal fungus. There was no growth on fungal culture, but fungal polymerase chain reaction identified a DNA sequence compatible with Exophiala sp. (99%). Radiographs and computed tomography were helpful to determine a prognosis and course of action for this individual. This case emphasizes the need to include fungal infections as a differential diagnosis when evaluating elasmobranchs with abnormal swimming behaviors and mineralization of the skeletal structures.",126
"We analyzed the incidence, clinical characteristics, prognostic-factors, and outcome of central nervous system (CNS) infections in consecutive patients with receiving umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) (n = 343) or HLA-matched sibling donor stem cell transplantation (MST) (n = 366). Thirty-four CNS infectioiis were documented at a median time of 116 days after transplantation (range, 7 to 1161). The cumulative incidence (CI) risk of developing a CNS infection was.6% at day +30, 2.3% at day +90, and 4.9% at 5 years. The 5-year CI of CNS infection was 8.2% after UCBT and 1.7% after MST (P<.001). The causative micro-organisms of CNS infections were fungi (35%), virus (32%), Toxoplasma spp. (12%), and bacteria (12%). Fungal infections occurred in 11 patients after UCBT and 1 after MST and were due to Aspergillus spp. (n = 8), Cryptococcus neoformans (n = 2), Scedosporium prolificans (n = 1), and Mucor (n = 1). Except for 1 patient, all died from CNS fungal infection. Viral infections occurred in 9 patients after UCBT and 1 after MST and were due to human herpes virus 6 (n = 7), cytomegalovirus (n = 2), and varicella zoster virus (n = 1). CNS toxoplasmosis was diagnosed in 3 patients after UCBT and 1 after MST. Other pathogens were Staphylococcus spp, Nocardia spp, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Twenty of the 34 patients (59%) died from the CNS infection. In multivariable analysis, UCBT and disease stage beyond first complete remission were independently associated with the risk of developing CNS infections. The 5-year overall survival was 19% in patients who developed a CNS and 39% for those who did not (P =.006). In conclusion, our study showed that CNS infections are a significant clinical problem after stem cell transplantation associated with poor survival. They were more frequent after UCBT compared to MST. (C) 2017 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.",126
"Recently, flutter active control using linear parameter varying (LPV) framework has attracted a lot of attention. LPV control synthesis usually generates controllers that are at least of the same order as the aeroelastic models. Therefore, the reduced-order model is required by synthesis for avoidance of large computation cost and high-order controller. This paper proposes a new procedure for generation of accurate reduced-order linear time-invariant (LTI) models by using system identification from flutter testing data. The proposed approach is in two steps. The well-known poly-reference least squares complex frequency (p-LSCF) algorithm is firstly employed for modal parameter identification from frequency response measurement. After parameter identification, the dominant physical modes are determined by clear stabilization diagrams and clustering technique. In the second step, with prior knowledge of physical poles, the improved frequencydomain maximum likelihood (ML) estimator is presented for building accurate reduced-order model. Before ML estimation, an improved subspace identification considering the poles constraint is also proposed for initializing the iterative procedure. Finally, the performance of the proposed procedure is validated by real flight flutter test data. (C) 2016 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Production and hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

"While ustekinumab has been widely used as an effective biologic for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis, no prospective studies have specifically investigated the clinical factors that may influence treatment outcomes with ustekinumab. This post-hoc analysis aimed to identify specific clinical factors that may influence treatment outcomes with ustekinumab in psoriasis patients. In the MARCOPOLO study, 102 Korean patients with moderate to severe psoriasis were analyzed to assess the influence of baseline characteristics as clinical factors on clinical response (improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index by 75%/90% [PASI75/PASI90]) to ustekinumab. In addition, differences in PASI75 and PASI90 responses between the responder group and non-responders were evaluated at weeks 28 and 52. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine adjusted clinical factors predicting treatment outcomes among patient characteristics. At week 28, there was a significant difference in PASI75/PASI90 response based on prior biologic experience, although the difference did not persist at week 52. In addition, after adjusting for the effects of relevant clinical factors, biologic experience was significantly associated with less PASI75 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.14, P = 0.001) and PASI90 (OR = 0.22, P = 0.036) responses at week 28. The presence of comorbidities was higher among non-responders than among PASI75/PASI90 responders at both weeks 28 and 52, but was not statistically significant. Previous biologic use was the only clinical factor predicting less response at week 28, although it did not influence the clinical response after week 52. Further studies are warranted to investigate the association between presence of comorbidities and clinical response.",21
"In this paper, the truncated Painlev'e analysis and the consistent tanh expansion (CTE) method are developed for the (2+1)-dimensional breaking soliton equation. As a result, the soliton-cnoidal wave interaction solution of the equation is explicitly given, which is difficult to be found by other traditional methods. When the value of the Jacobi elliptic function modulus m = 1, the soliton-cnoidal wave interaction solution reduces back to the two-soliton solution. The method can also be extended to other types of nonlinear evolution equations in mathematical physics.",24
"Recent studies have established resident memory T cells (T-RM) as the dominant memory lymphocyte population surveying most nonlymphoid tissues. Unlike other memory T cell lineages, T-RM do not recirculate through blood and are permanently confined to their tissue of residence. T-RM orchestrate local immune responses and have been shown to accelerate local pathogen control in many experimental infection models. Here we briefly summarize recent advances in T-RM differentiation, maintenance, and their protective function. While little is known, we have speculated on the potential implications of T-RM for transplantation biology. Areas of emphasis include the role of passenger T-RM in controlling latent viral recrudescence in donor organs, donor T-RM as a source of graft-versus-host disease, the ability of T-RM to potently induce inflammation through sensing and alarm functions, and differentiation of host T cells into T-RM in response to local cues inside the allograft. Further investigation of T-RM in the context of transplantation might identify therapeutic targets to prolong graft survival. This review discusses the phenotype, function, and potential relevance for transplantation of resident memory T cells.",31
"OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to analyze the surgical safety of retaining the glands in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (mPTC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 156 cases of mPTC were retrospectively reviewed and divided into four groups according to the treatment: group A (conservative follow-up group, 30 cases), group B (total resection of unilateral gland combined with isthmic resection, 48 cases), group C (total resection of unilateral gland combined with subtotal resection of contralateral gland, 47 cases), and group D (total resection of bilateral glands, 31 cases). The average follow-up time was 34.5 months. RESULTS: The occurrence rate of hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, hypocalcemia, injury of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and total occurrence rate in the group B were significantly lower than in the group C and group D, and the differences were statistically significant (p<0.05). The 75% survival time was 33 months in group A, 35 months in group B, and 34 months in group D. The survival time of group A was significantly less than in the other groups, and the difference was statistically significant (p0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The total resection of the unilateral gland combined with isthmic resection, which conserves gland functionality, reduces complications and maintains survival time. It is, therefore, worthy of further clinical application.",133
"ObjectiveTo examine sex and age distributions in neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) patients based on a systematic literature review. MethodEMBASE and PubMed databases were searched to identify any observation of NMS published from January 1, 1998 through November 1, 2014 that was accessible and interpretable (using language translation software). Redundant and equivocal reports were excluded. Sex ratio and age distributions were examined using standard graphical techniques and measures of association. ResultsTwenty-eight independent sex ratio estimates were included. Males predominated in most (75%) estimates with an overall median sex ratio of 1.47 (95% CI, 1.20-1.80). NMS incidence peaked at age 20-25 years and declined steadily thereafter, with males consistently outnumbering females at all but the oldest age intervals. ConclusionNMS patients are 50% more likely to be males, and NMS is most likely to occur in young adulthood.",72
"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is one of the leading causes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide but the mechanistic basis as to how chronic HCV infection furthers the HCC process remains only poorly understood. Accumulating evidence indicates that HCV core and nonstructural proteins provoke activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, and the evidence supporting a role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the onset and progression of HCC is compelling. Convincing molecular explanations as to how expression of viral effectors translates into increased activity of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling machinery are still largely lacking, hampering the design of rational strategies aimed at preventing HCC. Furthermore, how such increased signaling is especially associated with HCC oncogenesis in the context of HCV infection remains obscure as well. Here we review the body of contemporary biomedical knowledge on the role of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in the progression from chronic hepatitis C to cirrhosis and HCC and explore potential hypotheses as to the mechanisms involved.",130
"The swarm cognitive behavior of bees readily translates to swarm intelligence with ""social cognition,"" thus giving rise to the rapid promotion of survival skills and resource allocation. This paper presents a novel cognitively inspired artificial bee colony clustering (ABCC) algorithm with a clustering evaluation model to manage the energy consumption in cognitive wireless sensor networks (CWSNs). The ABCC algorithm can optimally align with the dynamics of the sensor nodes and cluster heads in CWSNs. These sensor nodes and cluster heads adapt to topological changes in the network graph over time. One of the major challenges with employing CWSNs is to maximize the lifetime of the networks. The ABCC algorithm is able to reduce and balance the energy consumption of nodes across the networks. Artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization is attractive for this application as the cognitive behaviors of artificial bees match perfectly with the intrinsic dynamics in cognitive wireless sensor networks. Additionally, it employs fewer control parameters compared to other heuristic algorithms, making identification of optimal parameter settings easier. Simulation results illustrate that the ABCC algorithm outperforms particle swarm optimisation (PSO), group search optimization (GSO), low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH), LEACH-centralized (LEACH-C), and hybrid energy-efficient distributed clustering (HEED) for energy management in CWSNs. Our proposed algorithm is increasingly superior to these other approaches as the number of nodes in the network grows.",62
"Internet protocol (IP) spoofing is a serious problem on the Internet. It is an attractive technique for adversaries who wish to amplify their network attacks and retain anonymity. Many approaches have been proposed to prevent IP spoofing attacks; however, they do not address a significant deployment issue, i.e., filtering inefficiency caused by a lack of deployment incentives for adopters. To defeat attacks effectively, one mechanism must be widely deployed on the network; however, the majority of the antispoofing mechanisms are unsuitable to solve the deployment issue by themselves. Each mechanism can work separately; however, their defensive power is considerably weak when insufficiently deployed. If we coordinate partially deployed mechanisms such that they work together, they demonstrate considerably superior performance by creating a synergy effect that overcomes their limited deployment. Therefore, we propose a universal antispoofing (UAS) mechanism that incorporates existing mechanisms to thwart IP spoofing attacks. In the proposed mechanism, intermediate routers utilize any existing anti-spoofing mechanism that can ascertain if a packet is spoofed and records this decision in the packet header. The edge routers of a victim network can estimate the forgery of a packet based on this information sent by the upstream routers. The results of experiments conducted with real Internet topologies indicate that UAS reduces false alarms up to 84.5% compared to the case where each mechanism operates individually.",46
"4D printing, which is the combination of 3D printing technology and printable smart materials, provides the potential of automating actuation devices. In this paper, we have used a modifiedfused deposition modelling 3D printing technology to fabricate a double-layer laminate smart material, which can be activated by temperature directly or by an electric circuit indirectly. A double-layer laminate mathematical model has been developed to describe the bending behaviour caused by the mismatch strain between the surface layer and the basal layer. The electrocaloric deformation testings were performed to find the different bending rules of this low-cost printed active composite in different physical states. The considerable maximal deformation values and deformation force (7 mm and 100 mN for these carbon fibre (CF)/polylactic acid specimens, and 10 mm and 200 mN for these CF/polyether-ether-ketone specimens in the paper) provide this double-layer smart material and 4D printing method the prospective to be applied in biomimetic sensors, actuators, transducers, and artificial muscles.",103
"The accumulation of anecdotal accounts of copycat crime suggests that popular culture plays an important role in some instances and aspects of criminal behavior. However, there is little empirical research specifically examining the copycat effect on criminal behavior. Questions remain regarding the nature and extent of copycat crime, cultural influences that shape the copycat effect, the role and relevance of popular culture as a motivating factor for criminal behavior, and issues the copycat phenomenon raises for legal determinations of criminal responsibility. This paper reviews the research literature and contemporary case examples of copycat crime with attention to the influence of mass media technology on criminal behavior, the mechanisms of media-mediated crime, and the relevance of understanding the copycat phenomenon for determinations of criminal responsibility in insanity cases. An integrative theoretical model of copycat crime is proposed, a methodological framework for empirically investigating copycat crime is presented, and practical implications for understanding the role of the copycat effect on criminal behavior are discussed.

"Zernike moments (ZMs) are very useful image descriptors which belong to a family of orthogonal rotation invariant moments. Due to their many attractive characteristics, they have been used in many pattern recognition, image processing and computer vision applications. However, they suffer from very high computation complexity which prohibits their use in many practical problems. The ZMs are computed as a convolution process between the image data and the Zernike kernel functions. In the past, various attempts have been made for the efficient computation of ZMs and considerable success has been achieved using recursive relations and 8-way symmetry/anti-symmetry of Zernike function. In this paper, we propose a new computational flow model for the convolution of the image data with the Zernike kernel functions. The proposed model also takes advantage of the 8-way symmetry/anti-symmetry property of the kernel function and builds up the convolution process which reduces the number of additions/subtractions from 56 to 24 and the number of multiplications from 12 to 8 (refer Table 6 in the text) for each location in an octant of a circular disk on which the moments are computed. Detailed experimental results show that the speed of the ZMs computation increases by a factor varying from 15% to 41% (depending upon the order of moments) for multiple images as compared to the existing fast algorithms available in the literature. When ZMs are computed at each pixel of an image on overlapping blocks, the improvement in computation time varies from 10% to 33%. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.",0
"Multistage Flash Desalination (MSF) is currently facing an enormous challenge in cutting of the cost: within the last few years, the MSF experienced a gradual decline in investment compared to other techniques of desalting water and thus, a significant improvement is required to remain attractive for capital investors. Improved process control is a cost effective approach to energy conservation and increased process profitability. In this work, a dynamic model is presented using gPROMS model builder to optimize and control MSF process. The Proportional Integral Derivative controller (PID) and Generic Model Control (GMC) are used successfully to control the Top brine temperature (TBT) and the brine level (BL) in the last stage at different times of the year. The objectives of this study are: firstly, to obtain optimum TBT and BL profiles for four different seasons throughout the year by minimizing the Total Seasonal Operating Cost (TSOC); secondly, to track the optimum TBT and BL profiles using PID and GMC controllers with and without the presence of constraints; thirdly, to examine how both types of controllers handle the disturbances which occur in the plant. The results are promising and show that GMC controller provides better performance over conventional PID controller to handle a nonlinear system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",59
"In this paper we present a research design framed through feminist epistemology. Our research proposal is to study the impacts of male unemployment on the division of household chores and responsibilities in a suburb of Barcelona. Understanding the complexity of this type of research proposal, we have created a theoretical framework that allows us to understand all the aspects that we have to take in to account to undertake this study. Does (involuntary) male unemployment mean that men take on more domestic and caretaking responsibilities? Does the economic crisis change gender roles, based in the dichotomy of breadwinner/caregiver? This design draws from an array of previous studies that demonstrate that negotiations within the home often exceed the total amount of income.",77
"The analysis of the Filtered-x Least Mean Square (FxLMS) algorithm can be based either on a stochastic or deterministic approach. One of the drawbacks of the stochastic analysis is that it relies on several assumptions which are not justified if the reference signal is time periodic. To overcome these limitations, several deterministic methods have been suggested. However, useful results have been reported only for setups with certain filter length, secondary path model, or reference signal. In this paper, an exact Linear Time-Periodic (LTP) representation is proposed assuming only that the reference is synchronously-sampled. The representation is derived for a general FxLMS system, which also covers the multichannel topology of several parallel filters and its common narrowband modification. The representation is found to have a Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) form if the filter length is suitably chosen. The usability of the method is demonstrated in a numerically computed example by comparing it to an approximate LTI model.",58
"This paper reports on findings from the first Western Australian Survey of Educators of Sexuality Education, which aimed to assess the state of relationships and sexuality education (RSE) in the state of Western Australia. Key findings show that secondary school teachers provided more hours of RSE instruction than the national average. However, they mainly taught curriculum topics such as Abstinence from Intercourse until Married, Effects of Alcohol/drug Use on Decision-making, Puberty, and Sex and Ethics (respectful relationships). The least taught subjects included Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) and HIV/AIDS, Birth Control, the Impact of Media on Sexual Identity and Sexual Orientation. These findings are of concern when one considers that nationally, Western Australia has higher rates of STIs among young people aged 15-24years and teenage pregnancies, than other parts of the country. Results from the survey can be used to form a baseline measure ahead of the roll-out of the Australian Curriculum, which includes RSE as a focus area, and the new Western Australian Curriculum for Health and Physical Education.",116

"AimsIt has been reported that somatic treatment in patients with affective symptoms has a higher risk of failure. The aim was to investigate whether affective symptoms could predict the outcome of sacral neuromodulation (SNM) for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). MethodsAll patients that underwent a SNM evaluation between 2006 and 2013 and filled out a Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS) before treatment, were included. Chi-square analysis and bivariate logistic regression were used to assess associations and predictive value. ResultsEighty-six patients were included, 65 females and 21 males. Most patients, 66, had overactive bladder syndrome (OAB). The remaining 20 patients suffered from non-obstructive urinary retention (NOR). Thirty-nine OAB patients and 17 NOR patients, had a normal total HADS score before treatment. Significantly more patients showed abnormal HADS-D (P=0.047) and HADS-A (P=0.015) scores in the OAB group compared to the NOR group. Success of SNM could not be predicted by the HADS score P=0.464 (after 1 year P=0.446). Subsequent analysis revealed that an abnormal HADS score was not related to the occurrence of SNM adverse events. ConclusionsThe present study did not reveal a significant relationship between an abnormal HADS score and failure of the SNM test period in a mixed group of OAB and NOR patients. However, differences between OAB and NOR patients concerning affective symptoms were present. It is known that psychological factors play a role in the severity of LUTS, but they may not predict SNM outcome. Neurourol. Urodynam. 35:1011-1016, 2016. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",17

"Closed-loop heat pump drying system has its particular characteristics, and in this paper a simultaneous control strategy is proposed to improve the precision of superheat and drying temperature. The stability of drying temperature guarantees the quality of drying material. And on the premise, superheat should be accurate and stable to improve energy usage. Two fuzzy controllers employing different membership functions and control rules are used to achieve more stable drying temperature. The superheat controller is mainly composed of a PID controller and a conversion emergency controller which accelerates the response of electronic expansion valve. The experimental results show that the temperatures at the outlet of indoor and outdoor condensers give smaller fluctuations. The variations of superheat are investigated when the temperature of drying chamber changes from ambient temperature to 25/30 degrees C, from 25 to 30 degrees C and from 30 to 25 degrees C, respectively. All the experimental data confirm that the new controller is applicable to decrease the nonlinearities of superheat and drying temperature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",59
"A field enquiry mentioned the potential positive impact of a feed restriction on the health of young rabbits, but no objective information relates the intake to digestive health. The effects of a post-weaning feed restriction strategy were thus studied on digestive health and growth and carcass parameters of the growing rabbit, using a monofactorial design that produces a quantitative linear reduction of the intake, from ad libitum (AL group) to 80%, 70% and 60% of AL. The study was performed simultaneously in six experimental sites, on 1984 growing rabbits (496 per treatment) collectively caged from weaning (34 to 38 days of age, depending on the site) to slaughter (68 to 72 days). The feeding programme was applied as followed: restriction during 21 days after weaning, and then ad libitum till slaughter During the feed restriction period the growth rate was linearly reduced with the restriction level, by 0.5 g/day for each percent of intake reduction. When returning to ad libitum intake (after 54 days old) a compensatory growth and a higher feed efficiency occurred. Therefore, the impact of the feeding programme on the slaughter weight (SW) was significant (-4.5 g/% of restriction), but relatively moderate: the weight loss of the more-restricted rabbits (60%) reached 7.7% (-200 g) compared to the AL group. Over the whole fattening period the feed restriction reduced linearly and significantly the feed conversion (FC) (-0.0077 unit/% of restriction). Carcass traits were little affected by the feeding programme, except for a slightly lower decrease of the dressing percentage (mean: 1.2 units between AL and the three restricted groups). On the six experimental sites, mortality and morbidity were always caused by acute digestive disorders, namely diarrhoea and/or caecal impaction. Independent of the treatment, the mortality rate strongly varied according to the site (between 7% and 18% from weaning to 54 days and for the AL group). During feed restriction, the mortality was significantly lower from a restriction threshold of 80% (meanly: -9% compared to AL). The morbidity was also significantly reduced (-6%) for the two most restricted groups (70% and 60%). The favourable effect of a lower intake on health did not persist after returning to ad libitum intake (54 days to slaughter), since mortality and morbidity were not significantly different among the treatments. Such a feeding strategy thus represents a double benefit in terms of feed costs and lower losses of young rabbits.",122
"Jens Rasmussen's multifaceted legacy includes cognitive work analysis (CWA), a framework for the analysis, design, and evaluation of complex sociotechnical systems. After considering the framework's origins, this paper reviews its progress, predictably covering experimental research on ecological interface design, case studies of the application of CWA to human factors and engineering problems in industry, and methods and modelling tools for CWA. Emphasis is placed, however, on studying the nexus between some of the recent results obtained with CWA and the original field studies of human problem solving that motivated the framework's development. Of particular interest is a case study of the use of CWA for military doctrine development, a problem commonly regarded as lying outside the fields of human factors and engineering. It is concluded that the value of CWA, even for such diverse problems, is likely to result from its conceptual grounding in empirical observations of patterns of human reasoning in complex systems.

"Objectives: To elucidate the benefits, pitfalls and risks of phytotherapy in the clinical practice of otorhinolaryngology. Material and methods: The PubMed and Cochrane databases were searched using the following keywords: phytotherapy, phytomedicine, herbs, otology, rhinology, laryngology, otitis, rhinitis, laryngitis and otorhinolaryngology. Seventy-two articles (18 prospective randomized studies, 4 Cochrane analyses, 4 meta-analysis and 15 reviews of the literature) devoted to clinical studies were analyzed. Articles devoted to in vitro or animal studies, biochemical analyses or case reports (including fewer than 10 patients) and articles dealing with honey, aromatherapy or minerals were excluded. Results: Per os ginkgo biloba has no indications in tinnitus, pre sbycusis or anosmia following viral rhinitis. Traditional Asian medicine has no proven benefit in sudden deafness or laryngeal papillomatosis. Per os mistletoe extracts associated to conventional treatment for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma does not increase 5-year survival. Extracts of various herbs, notably echinacea, eucalyptus, petasites hybridus, pelargonium sidoides, rosemary, spirulina and thyme, show superiority over placebo for rhinosinusitis and allergic rhinitis, as does gingko biloba for selected vertigo. There have been encouraging preliminary results for intratumoral injection of mistletoe in head and neck carcinoma and acupoint herbal patching for allergic rhinitis. Herb intake should be screened for in case of certain unexplained symptoms such as epistaxis, headache or dizziness, or signs suggesting allergy. Phytotherapy should be interrupted ahead of surgery and/or chemotherapy. Conclusion: Scientific proof of the benefit of phytotherapy in otorhinolaryngology remains to be established but, given its widespread use and the reported data, knowledge of this form of treatment needs to be developed.

"Hypervisors enable cloud computing model to provide scalable infrastructures and on-demand access to computing resources as they support multiple operating systems to run on one physical server concurrently. This mechanism enhances utilization of physical server thus reduces server count in the data center. Hypervisors also drive the benefits of reduced IT infrastructure setup and maintenance costs along with power savings. It is interesting to know different hypervisors' performance for the consolidated application workloads. Three hypervisors ESXi, XenServer, and KVM are carefully chosen to represent three categories full virtualized, para-virtualized, and hybrid virtualized respectively for the experiment. We have created a private cloud using CloudStack. Hypervisors are deployed as hosts in the private cloud in the respective clusters. Each hypervisor is deployed with three virtual machines. Three applications web server, application server, and database servers are installed on three virtual machines. Experiments are designed using Design of Experiments (DOE) methodology. With concurrently running virtual machines, each hypervisor is stressed with the consolidated real-time workloads (web load, application load, and OLTP) and important system information is gathered using SIGAR framework. The paper proposes a new scoring formula for hypervisors' performance in the private cloud for consolidated application workloads and the accuracy of the results are complemented with sound statistical analysis using DOE.

"Recursive branch and bound algorithms are often used, either rigorously or non-rigorously, to refine and isolate solutions to global optimization problems or systems of equations and inequalities involving nonlinear functions. The presented software library, Kodiak, integrates numeric and symbolic computation into a generic framework for the solution of such problems over hyper-rectangular variable and parameter domains. The correctness of both the generic branch and bound algorithm and the self-validating enclosure methods used, namely interval arithmetic and, for polynomials and rational functions, Bernstein expansion, has been formally verified. The algorithm has three main instantiations, for systems of equations and inequalities, for constrained global optimization, and for the computation of equilibria and bifurcation sets for systems of ordinary differential equations. For the latter category, and to enable the computation of bisection heuristics to reduce the branching factor, advantage is taken of the partial derivatives of the constraint functions, which are symbolically manipulated. Pavings (unions of box subsets) for a continuum of solutions to underdetermined systems may also be produced. The capabilities of the software tool are outlined, and computational examples are presented.",24
"Studies have suggested a compromised postural control in individuals with knee osteoarthritis (OA) evidenced by larger and faster displacement of center of pressure (COP). However, quantification of postural control in the mini-squat posture performed by patients with early knee OA and its relation to muscle strength and self-reported symptoms have not been investigated. The main aim of this cross-sectional, observational, controlled study was to determine whether postural control in the mini-squat posture differs between individuals with early knee OA and a control group (CG) and verify the relation among knee extensor torque (MET) and self-reported physical function, stiffness and pain. Twenty four individuals with knee OA grades I and II (OAG) (mean age: 5235 +/- 5.00) and twenty subjects without knee injuries (CG) (mean age: 51.40 +/- 8.07) participated in this study. Participants were assessed in postural control through a force plate (Bertec Mod. USA), which provided information about the anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) COP displacement during the mini-squat, in isometric, concentric and eccentric knee extensor torque (MET) (90/s) through an isokinetic dynamometer (BiodexMulti-Joint System3, Biodex Medical Incorporation, New York, NY, USA), and in self-reported symptoms through the WOMAC questionnaire. The main outcomes measured were the AP and ML COP amplitude and velocity of displacement; isometric, concentric, and eccentric KET and self-reported physical function, stiffness and pain. No significant differences were found between groups for postural control (p >0.05). Significant lower eccentric MET (p = 0.01) and higher scores for the WOMAC subscales of pain (p = <0.001), stiffness (p = 0.001) and physical function (p < 0.001) were found for the OAG. Moderate and negative correlations were found between the AP COP amplitude of displacement and physical function (rho = 0.40, p = 0.02). Moderate and negative correlations were observed between the AP COP velocity of displacement and physical function (rho = 0.47, p = 0.01) and stiffness (rho = 0.45, p = 0.02). The findings of the present study emphasize the importance of rehabilitation from the early degrees of knee OA to prevent postural instability and the need to include quadriceps muscle strengthening, especially by eccentric contractions. The relationship between the self-reported symptoms and a lower and slower COP displacement suggest that the postural control strategy during tasks with a semi-flexed knee should be further investigated.

"In response to concerns over hazardous chemicals in children's products, Washington State passed the Children's Safe Product Act (CSPA). CSPA requires manufacturers to report the concentration of 66 chemicals in children's products. We describe a framework for the toxicological prioritization of the ten chemical groups most frequently reported under CSPA. The framework scores lifestage, exposure duration, primary, secondary and tertiary exposure routes, toxicokinetics and chemical properties to calculate an exposure score. Four toxicological endpoints were assessed based on curated national and international databases: reproductive and developmental toxicity, endocrine disruption, neurotoxicity and carcinogenicity. A total priority index was calculated from the product of the toxicity and exposure scores. The three highest priority chemicals were formaldehyde, dibutyl phthalate and styrene. Elements of the framework were compared to existing prioritization tools, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ExpoCast and Toxicological Prioritization Index (ToxPi). The CSPA framework allowed us to examine toxicity and exposure pathways in a lifestage-specific manner, providing a relatively high throughput approach to prioritizing hazardous chemicals found in children's products.",117
"Helper T cell development and function must be tightly regulated to induce an appropriate immune response that eliminates specific pathogens yet prevents autoimmunity. Many approaches involving different model organisms have been utilized to understand the mechanisms controlling helper T cell development and function. However, studies using mouse models have proven to be highly informative due to the availability of genetic, cellular, and biochemical systems. One genetic approach in mice used by many labs involves retroviral transduction of primary helper T cells. This is a powerful approach due to its relative ease, making it accessible to almost any laboratory with basic skills in molecular biology and immunology. Therefore, multiple genes in wild type or mutant forms can readily be tested for function in helper T cells to understand their importance and mechanisms of action. We have optimized this approach and describe here the protocols for production of high titer retroviruses, isolation of primary murine helper T cells, and their transduction by retroviruses and differentiation toward the different helper subsets. Finally, the use of this approach is described in uncovering mechanisms utilized by microRNAs (miRNAs) to regulate pathways controlling helper T cell development and function.",30
"Given a matrix of size N, two dimensional range minimum queries (2D-RMQs) ask for the position of the minimum element in a rectangular range within the matrix. We study trade-offs between the query time and the additional space used by indexing data structures that support 2D-RMQ5. Using a novel technique-the discrepancy properties of Fibonacci lattices we give an indexing data structure for 2D-RMQs that uses O (N/c) bits additional space with O (c logc(log log c)(2)) query time, for any parameter c, 4 <= c <= N. Also, when the entries of the input matrix are from 10,11, we show that the query time can be improved to O (c logc) with the same space usage. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.",41

"This paper presents a methodological solution to The Battle of Background Leakage Assessment for Water Networks (BBLAWN) competition. The methodology employs two constrained multiple-objective optimization problems and is implemented in the context of a software application for the generic hydraulic optimization and benchmarking of water distribution system (WDS) problems. The objectives are the combined infrastructure and operational costs and system-wide leakage, both to be minimized. In order to accelerate the evaluation of potential solutions, a distributed computing approach permits multiple EPANET solutions to be evaluated in parallel. A pressure-driven demand extension to EPANET assists the optimization in accurately ranking near-feasible solutions and to dynamically allocate leakage demand to nodes. Pressure-reducing valves (PRVs) have been located in two ways: a priori, with respect to the optimization analysis, and a posteriori after the infrastructure optimization to reduce excess pressure and pipe leakage. The latter demonstrates better overall fitness, leading to optimal configurations dominating those obtained with the former. Several temporal resolutions for PRV settings have been evaluated to contrast the optimal solutions with the computational effort required. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.",2
"This paper describes the implementation of two neuron emulator circuits. The first circuit provides the electrical properties of a neuron as seen from a single patch-clamp electrode with a defined action potential (AP) charge output and the second circuit offers multi-channel output with an adjustable phase delay that provides responses typically seen by a longitudinal electrode (e.g., peripheral nerve cuff or intraneural electrode) using a 3 x 4 cm(2) prototype board. The emulators are intended for testing electrophysiological equipment such as patch-clamp amplifiers and multi-channel devices. APs are generated with a voltage-dependent frequency controlled by a microcontroller. The reported measured results confirm the capability of performing voltage-clamp and rate-responsive current-clamp techniques and generating phase-delayed AP outputs, respectively.",51
"Background Over the past decade, regulatory bodies and scientific societies recommended, as primary efficacy outcome, a score that reflects both symptom severity and use of rescue medication for clinical trials in allergy immunotherapy (AIT). Objective We sought to compare the results obtained with two subject-specific scores, the Combined Score (CS) and the Adjusted Symptom Score (AdSS), for assessment of AIT in seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis due to birch and grass pollen allergens. Methods CS and AdSS were evaluated in subjects receiving a 300IR dose of allergen extract daily, by sublingual route, in four clinical trials with the 5-grass pollen tablet (NCT00367640, NCT00409409, NCT00955825 and NCT00418379) and one with the birch pollen solution (NCT01731249). The CS is derived from the Rhinoconjunctivitis Total Symptom Score (RTSS) and the Rescue Medication Score (RMS) giving equal weight to symptoms and medication use. The AdSS is a symptom score adjusting for rescue medication use. Efficacy end-points were analysed using an analysis of covariance linear model. Results In all trials, despite the different constructs of the two scores, Combined Score or Adjusted Symptom Score were similarly reduced in the 300IR group compared to the placebo group. Treatment effect was consistently demonstrated with both scores, CS and AdSS, used as either daily scores or average of the daily scores over the pollen season. Minor differences with the same statistical conclusions were observed between the results, leading to the same interpretation. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance The two scores, combined and adjusted scores, for evaluation of clinical efficacy of AIT have led to similar results, with similar statistical conclusions and similar interpretation.",33
"Purpose Association of subclinical hypothyroidism with type 2 diabetes and its complications has been previously documented. These reports were, however, inconclusive and mainly gathered from Chinese and East Asian populations. In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism and its relationship with diabetic nephropathy in Iranian individuals with type 2 diabetes, drawn from a white Middle Eastern population with an increasing prevalence of diabetes. Methods In this cross- sectional study, 255 Iranian participants with type 2 diabetes and without history of thyroid disorders were included. Patients with TSH >4.2 mIU/ L and normal T4 were classified as having subclinical hypothyroidism. Diabetic nephropathy was diagnosed based on abnormal 24- h urinary albumin or protein measurements (24- h urinary albumin >= 30mg/ day or 24- h urinary protein >= 150 mg/ day). Multivariate logistic regression was employed to obtain the OR for the relationship between subclinical hypothyroidism and diabetic nephropathy. Results We found that subclinical hypothyroidism and diabetic nephropathy were as prevalent as 18.1 and 41.2 %, respectively, among the participants. We also found that subclinical hypothyroidism was independently associated with higher rates of diabetic nephropathy, after multivariable adjustment ( OR [ 95 % CI] 3.23 [ 1.42- 7.37], p = 0.005). Conclusions We found that the prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism in Iranian diabetic population was among the highest rates reported to date. Our data supported the independent association of subclinical hypothyroidism with diabetic nephropathy, calling for further investigations to evaluate their longitudinal associations.",133
"Background: The aim of this study was to compare radiotherapy plans for Stage I-II nasal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NNKTL) using helical tomotherapy (HT), volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT), Fixed-Field intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT). Methods: Eight patents with Stage I-II NNKTL treated with IMRT were re-planned for HT, VMAT (two full arcs), and 3D-CRT. The quality of target coverage, the exposure of normal tissue and the efficiency of radiation delivery were analyzed. Results: HT showed significant improvement over IMRT in terms of D-98%, cold spot volume and homogeneity index (HI) of planning target volume (PTV). VMAT provided best dose uniformity (p = 0.000) to PTV, while HT had best dose homogeneity among the four radiotherapy techniques (p = 0.000) to PTV. VMAT obviously reduced treatment time (p = 0.010; 0.000) compared to HT and IMRT. Mean dose of left and right optic nerve was significantly reduced by IMRT compared to HT (19.86%, p = 0.000; 21.40%, p = 0.002) and VMAT (8.97%, p = 0.002; 9.35%, p = 0.001), and maximum dose of left lens of VMAT increased over the HT (36.25%, p = 0.043) and IMRT (40.65%, p = 0.001). Conclusion: The unexpected results show that both HT and VMAT can achieve higher conformal treatment plans while getting worse organs at risk (OARs) sparing than IMRT for patients with Stage I-II NNKTL. VMAT requires the shortest delivery time, and IMRT delivers the lowest dose to most OARs. The results could provide guidance for selecting proper radiation technologies for different cases.",7
"Fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) is an established successful treatment modality for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). The safety profile and potential therapeutic advantages of FMT for diseases associated with dysbiosis and immune dysfunction have led to many publications, mainly case series, and while many studies and reviews have been published on the use of FMT for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), its potential use for other disease conditions has not been thoroughly reviewed. The aim of this review was to investigate the evidence surrounding the use of FMT in conditions other than IBD and CDI. A PubMed search was performed using the terms ""Fecal microbiota transplantation"" OR ""FMT"" OR ""Bacteriotherapy."" A total of 26 articles describing the use of FMT in a variety of both intra-and extraintestinal disease conditions including gastrointestinal, hematologic, neurologic, metabolic, infectious, and autoimmune disorders have been included in this review and have demonstrated some positive results. The studies included were case reports, case series, controlled trials, and cohort studies. The findings of these studies demonstrate that FMT, particularly in conditions associated with gastrointestinal dysbiosis, shows promise to provide another effective tool in the therapeutic armament of the practicing physician. FMT was found to be possibly effective in various diseases, mostly associated with enteric dysbiosis or with immune dysfunction. Randomized clinical studies on large populations should be performed to explore the effectiveness of this therapy, and basic research studies should be designed to gain understanding of the mechanisms through which impact these disorders.",4
"Aim: to provide an overview of the traumatic injuries sustained by players in the 2015 America Cup. Material and methods: we collected the medical reports on all the matches held during the 2015 America Cup, in Chile, in 2015. Twelve American teams took part in the championship, consisted of 26 matches with a total of 276 players. The physician for each team sent a request form of the traumatic injuries sustained, including the time at which the injury was produced, the location and diagnosis, its severity and the circumstances (contact injury, sanction, treatment required). Results: the mean number of minutes played was 233 (SD: 147) (5-570) minutes. An injury occurred every 58 minutes, which means that there were 17.25 injuries per 1,000 minutes of match time. We found 44 injuries in 30 players. There were 14 non-contact injuries, and 30 contact injuries, of which 13 were declared fouls and resulted in cards being given. Five teams had one injured player, two had 2, two had 4, and one had 25 injuries. The most frequent injuries were those to the lower limbs. The muscles strains happened in the second part of the second half of the match, the ACL rupture at the end of the first half, and the other sprains and strains in the second half. The contusions occurred at all times throughout the match, although they seemed to be concentrated towards the end of the first half, while the cases of tendinitis were caused in the first part of the second half. Conclusion: football injuries are very common, and even though serious injuries are rare, it is increasingly necessary to set protocols for action which ensure good medical attention at all levels to address the problems that arise, both during training and in competitions, and to be prepared to treat serious injuries if these occur.",28
"The unsteady-state gas dynamics at the intake of a turbocharged engine were analysed. The objective is to tune the intake line to low operating speeds where the exhaust gases lack the enthalpy needed to operate the turbocharger at rated speeds and to provide the boost pressure needed. The proposed methodology compensates for the lack of boost pressure by benefiting from the existing wave action at the intake. Zero-dimensional acoustic modelling is first used to investigate the geometrical parameters which have the most influnce on low-end acoustic tuning. Impedance bench and electrically driven engine tests complete the study and compare different intake configurations and two geometries of charge air coolers: an air-to-air charge air cooler and a water-cooled charge air cooler. Optimal intake configurations were found for low-end torque considerations as well as high-speed operation where a reduction in the pressure losses is most important. The findings were validated and established on an engine test bench with torque gain at different rotational speeds of the engine. The study led to the proposal of an active charge air duct which enables a solution to be found for the low-end torque where acoustic tuning is favoured and for high-speed operation where the boost pressure is readily available. The acoustic response of this part was compared with the reference solution, and conclusions and possible topics for future work were obtained from the analysis.",87

The objectives of this study are to determine and compare the factors that affect the students' academic achievement between the two faculties. The prediction results show there are five attributes that have been considered as factors that influence the students' academic performance.",84
"The present paper analyses the effect of self-efficacy in sports injury and to what extent such effect is mediated by coping strategies to competitive situations shown by athletes. 245 sportspeople were assessed regarding the number of injuries suffered the last 12 months, General Self-Efficacy and Coping Strategies. Regression analysis proved that two coping strategies, Emotional Calming and Risk Behavior, predicted the suffering of less or more injuries, respectively. A path analysis showed that Self-efficacy was not directly related to the number of injuries but indirectly through coping strategies. Unexpectedly, the greater self-efficacy induces both coping strategies oriented to trying new options and risky alternatives (Risk Behavior) and coping strategies directed to control negative emotions (Emotional Calming) which would supposedly be related to least risk-taking behaviors, the former increasing and the later decreasing vulnerability to sports injury.",27
"AIM to evaluate the quality and accuracy of websites written to the public on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) and assess their readability level. METHODS Google T, Bing T, and Yahoo T search engines were searched independently by three researchers in December 2014. Only English-language websites were selected on the basis of predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Researchers independently evaluated the quality of each website by using the DISCERN and the HONcode instruments. The readability levels were calculated using two formulas; the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Index, and the Coleman-Liau Readability Index. The agreement between the evaluators was calculated using Cohen kappa coefficient. RESULTS eighty-four websites were finally identified. Scores varied from a minimum DISCERN score of 18 to a maximum of 68 [ mean +/- SD, 42.2 +/- 10.7; median = 41.5, interquartile range, interquartile range (IQR) = 15.8] and a minimum score of HONcode of 0.14 and a maximum of 0.95 (mean +/- SD, 0.16 +/- 0.19; median = 0.45, IQR = 0.29). Most of these websites were reviewed in 2014 and 2015 (n = 51). The creators of these websites were: universities and research centers (n = 25, 30%), foundations and associations (n = 15, 18%), commercial and pharmaceutical companies (n = 25, 30%), charities and volunteer work (n = 9, 10%), and non-university educational bodies (n = 10, 12%). The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level readability score (mean +/- SD) was 11.9 +/- 2.4 and the Coleman-Liau Readability Index score was 12.6 +/- 1.5. Significant correlation was found between the two readability scores (R-2 = 0.509, p = 0.001). The overall agreement between evaluators measured by Cohen kappa coefficient was in the range of 0.804-0.876; rated as ""Good"". CONCLUSION The DISCERN and the HONcode scores of websites varied and the readability levels of most websites were above the public readability level. The study highlights the areas that need further improvement and development in patient education online materials about IBD.",118

"Background: Gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort, e.g. bloating or rumbling, is a common symptom in otherwise healthy adults. Approximately 20% of the population, particularly women suffer from gastrointestinal discomfort and this affects quality of life. Recent studies discovered a link between the body and mind, called the gut-brain axis. Psychosocial factors, such as e.g. daily stress may cause altered gut physiology leading to ileum contractions and consequently gastrointestinal symptoms. In vitro and ex vivo studies clearly showed that a Perilla frutescens extract combines prokinetic, antispasmodic and anti-inflammatory effects. The aim of the intervention was to investigate the effects of the proprietary Perilla extract on GI discomfort in healthy subjects with gastrointestinal discomfort and reduced bowel movements in comparison to a placebo product. Methods: The pilot study was performed according to a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel design. Fifty healthy subjects with gastrointestinal discomfort and reduced bowel movements, 30-70 years, documented their GI symptoms, stool frequency and consistency daily during a 2-week run-in phase and a 4-week intervention phase with Perilla frutescens extract or placebo. GI symptoms were assessed on a 5-point scale daily and average scores over 14 days intervals were calculated. Results: All GI symptoms were significantly improved over time by Perilla frutescens extract during the intervention phase (bloating: -0.44 +/- 0.56, p = 0.0003; passage of gas: -0.30 +/- 0.66, p = 0.0264; GI rumbling: -0.55 +/- 0.87, p = 0.0014; feeling of fullness: -0.36 +/- 0.72, p = 0.0152; abdominal discomfort: -0.54 +/- 0.75, p = 0.004), whereas in the placebo group only abdominal discomfort was significantly improved (-0.31 +/- 0.55, p = 0.0345). In the subgroup of women results were strengthened and a subscore out of bloating and abdominal discomfort was significantly improved against placebo (95% CI 0.003 to 0.77; p = 0.048). Conclusion: The demonstrated effects of Perilla frutescens extract to improve GI complaints offer very promising results, taking into consideration the challenging set up of a nutritional human study with healthy subjects and in the area of digestive health, which is known for high placebo effects.",122
"In this work the results obtained with the virtualisation of manufacturing processes engineering practices at Malaga University arc analyzed. This educative innovation tool allows to increase the efficiency of students learning because they can have available previously, by means of the computer, the different practise classes that they will do later.

"We propose an ultra-lightweight, compact, and low power block cipher BORON. BORON is a substitution and permutation based network, which operates on a 64-bit plain text and supports a key length of 128/80 bits. BORON has a compact structure which requires 1939 gate equivalents (GEs) for a 128-bit key and 1626 GEs for an 80-bit key. The BORON cipher includes shift operators, round permutation layers, and XOR operations. Its unique design helps generate a large number of active S-boxes in fewer rounds, which thwarts the linear and differential attacks on the cipher. BORON shows good performance on both hardware and software platforms. BORON consumes less power as compared to the lightweight cipher LED and it has a higher throughput as compared to other existing SP network ciphers. We also present the security analysis of BORON and its performance as an ultra-lightweight compact cipher. BORON is a well-suited cipher design for applications where both a small footprint area and low power dissipation play a crucial role.",57
"In the present paper, we introduced a general model of the equations of the formulation in the context of Lord-Shulman theory which includes one thermal relaxation time and Green-Lindsay theory with two thermal relaxation times as well as the classical dynamical coupled theory to study the effect of the rotation and the magnetic field on the total deformation of a micropolar thermoelastic medium with an internal heat source that is moving with a constant speed. The analytical method used to obtain the formula of the physical quantities is the normal mode analysis. Comparisons made with the results of the three theories in the presence and absence of the magnetic field as well as an internal, heat source. A comparison is also made with the results of the three theories for different values of the rotation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",88
"Background: We do not have a strong understanding of a health care organization's capacity for attempting and completing multiple and sometimes competing change initiatives. Capacity for change implementation is a critical success factor as the health care industry is faced with ongoing demands for change and transformation because of technological advances, market forces, and regulatory environment. Purpose: The aim of this study was to develop and validate a tool to measure health care organizations' capacity to change by building upon previous conceptualizations of absorptive capacity and organizational readiness for change. Methodology/Approach: A multistep process was used to develop the organizational capacity for change survey. The survey was sent to two populations requesting answers to questions about the organization's leadership, culture, and technologies in use throughout the organization. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to validate the survey as a measurement tool for organizational capacity for change in the health care setting. Findings: The resulting organizational capacity for change measurement tool proves to be a valid and reliable method of evaluating a hospital's capacity for change through the measurement of the population's perceptions related to leadership, culture, and organizational technologies. Practical Implications: The organizational capacity for change measurement tool can help health care managers and leaders evaluate the capacity of employees, departments, and teams for change before large-scale implementation.",66
"Background: Dysfunctional cognitions regarding weight and shape and their implications for self-esteem are considered core features of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. However, they have also been associated with the severity of binge eating disorder (BED). Therefore, they should be screened with appropriate instruments to tailor treatment to individual patient needs. The Mizes Anorectic Cognitions-Revised (MAC-R) is a self-report questionnaire that lists dysfunctional cognitions related to three hypothesized core beliefs typical of the psychopathology of eating disorders: weight and eating as the basis of approval from others; the belief that rigid self-control is fundamental to self-worth; and the rigidity of weight- and eating-regulation efforts. Objectives: The goal of the study was to confirm the factor structure and to assess the validity of the MAC-R among a sample that met full-threshold and subthreshold criteria for BED. Methods: We used data of women meeting full-threshold (n = 94) and subthreshold (n = 22) criteria for BED to conduct confirmatory factor analyses and to compute Spearman's correlations, in order to assess factorial, convergent, and discriminant validity. Results: Two models having a structure of three factors with or without a total score proved to be acceptable. The MAC-R total score was correlated with questionnaires assessing dimensions related to eating disorder psychopathology, adding to the validity of the questionnaire. Conclusion: These results were similar to those found in studies on the psychometric properties of the MAC among samples with anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, encouraging the use of the MAC-R as a research or clinical tool in order to further document the core beliefs underlying BED.",67
"The management of mood disorders during pregnancy is complex due to risks associated with medication use and risks associated with untreated depression. Antidepressant use during pregnancy is an exposure for the unborn child, and it currently remains unclear what long-term repercussions there might be from this exposure, though available data are reassuring. On the other hand, there are risks for both the mother and child of untreated depression during pregnancy. There is a real need for research into nonpharmacological strategies for the prevention of relapse of mood disorders in pregnant women who are off medications. We have reviewed a number of potential candidate interventions including psychotherapies, exercise, light box therapy (LBT), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), holistic strategies, and nutritional and herbal supplements. Currently there is a lack of evidence supporting the use of such strategies in the prevention of depressive relapse during pregnancy, though most of these strategies have at least some support for their use in the treatment of a major depressive episode. Carefully conducted research using one or more of these strategies in women who want to discontinue antidepressants for pregnancy is sorely needed.",71
"Objectives: Many existing healthcare interventions diffused before modern evidence-based standards of clinical- and cost-effectiveness. Disinvestment from ineffective or inappropriately applied practices is growing as a priority for international health policy, both for improved quality of care and sustainability of resource allocation. Australian policy stakeholders were canvassed to assess their perspectives on the challenges and the nature of disinvestment. Methods: Senior health policy stakeholders from Australia were criterion and snow-ball sampled (to identify opinion leaders). Participants were primed with a potential disinvestment case study and took part in individual semistructured interviews that focused on mechanisms and challenges within health policy to support disinvestment. Interviews were taped and transcribed for thematic analysis. Participant comments were de-identified. Results: Ten stakeholders were interviewed before saturation was reached. Three primary themes were identified. (i) The current focus on assessment of new and emerging health technologies/practices and lack of attention toward existing practices is due to resource limitations and methodological complexity. Participants considered a parallel model to that of Australia's current assessment process for new medical technologies is best-positioned to facilitate disinvestment. (ii) To advance the disinvestment agenda requires an explicit focus on the potential for cost-savings coupled with improved quality of care. (iii) Support (financial and collaborative) is needed for research advancement in the methodological underpinnings associated with health technology assessment and for disinvestment specifically. Conclusions: In this exploratory study, stakeholders support the notion that systematic policy approaches to disinvestment will improve equity, efficiency, quality, and safety of health care, as well as sustainability of resource allocation.",25
"Genetic improvement has been used to improve functional and nonfunctional properties of software. In this paper, we propose a new approach that applies a genetic programming (GP)-based genetic improvement to trade between functional and non-functional properties of existing software. The paper investigates possibilities and opportunities for improving non-functional parameters such as execution time, code size, or power consumption of median functions implemented using comparator networks. In general, it is impossible to improve non-functional parameters of the median function without accepting occasional errors in results because optimal implementations are available. In order to address this issue, we proposed a method providing suitable compromises between accuracy, execution time and power consumption. Traditionally, a randomly generated set of test vectors is employed so as to assess the quality of GP individuals. We demonstrated that such an approach may produce biased solutions if the test vectors are generated inappropriately. In order to measure the accuracy of determining a median value and avoid such a bias, we propose and formally analyze new quality metrics which are based on the positional error calculated using the permutation principle introduced in this paper. It is shown that the proposed method enables the discovery of solutions which show a significant improvement in execution time, power consumption, or size with respect to the accurate median function while keeping errors at a moderate level. Non-functional properties of the discovered solutions are estimated using data sets and validated by physical measurements on physical microcontrollers. The benefits of the evolved implementations are demonstrated on two real-world problems-sensor data processing and image processing. It is concluded that data processing software modules offer a great opportunity for genetic improvement. The results revealed that it is not even necessary to determine the median value exactly in many cases which helps to reduce power consumption or increase performance. The discovered implementations of accurate, as well as approximate median functions, are available as C functions for download and can be employed in a custom application (http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/research/groups/ehw/median).",90
"PURPOSE. Plasma kallikrein is a serine protease and circulating component of inflammation, which exerts clinically significant effects on vasogenic edema. This study examines the role of plasma kallikrein in VEGF-induced retinal edema. METHODS. Intravitreal injections of VEGF and saline vehicle were performed in plasma prekallikrein-deficient (KLKB1(-/-)) and wild-type (WT) mice, and in both rats and mice receiving a selective plasma kallikrein inhibitor, VA999272. Retinal vascular permeability (RVP) and retinal thickness were measured by Evans blue permeation and optical coherence tomography, respectively. The retinal kallikrein kinin system was examined by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Retinal neovascularization was investigated in KLKB1(-/-) and WT mice subjected to oxygen-induced retinopathy. RESULTS. Vascular endothelial growth factor-induced RVP and retinal thickening were reduced in KLKB1(-/-) mice by 68% and 47%, respectively, compared to VEGF responses in WT mice. Plasma kallikrein also contributes to TNF alpha-induced retinal thickening, which was reduced by 52% in KLKB1(-/-) mice. Systemic administration of VA999272 reduced VEGF-induced retinal thickening by 57% (P < 0.001) in mice and 53% (P < 0.001) in rats, compared to vehicle-treated controls. Intravitreal injection of VEGF in WT mice increased plasma prekallikrein in the retina, which was diffusely distributed throughout the inner and outer retinal layers. Avascular and neovascular areas induced by oxygen-induced retinopathy were similar in WT and KLKB1(-/-) mice. CONCLUSIONS. Vascular endothelial growth factor increases extravasation of plasma kallikrein into the retina, and plasma kallikrein is required for the full effects of VEGF on RVP and retinal thickening in rodents. Systemic plasma kallikrein inhibition may provide a therapeutic opportunity to treat VEGF-induced retina edema.",131
"Efficient transformation of lilies is required for their genetic improvement in ornamental and marketable qualities. Although Lilium longiflorum can be transformed by particle bombardment and Agrobacterium, the transformation frequency is low. In this study, we tested new Agrobacterium-mediated transformation methods using shoot segments combined with two different regeneration systems. Shoot segments were co-cultivated for 2 d with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain AGL1/pCAS04 harboring a binary vector carrying the neomycin phosphotransferase II driven by a promoter from the maize ubiquitin gene. The effect of different concentrations of 6-benzyladenine (BA) and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) on regeneration was investigated. The results indicated that Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 4.4 mu M BA and 0.5 mu M alpha-naphthalene acetic acid was optimal for shoot formation, and the nodal stem was the best explant for shoot induction. MS medium with 9.0 mu M 2,4-D and 0.4 mu M BA was optimal for callus induction. The direct shoot formation method regenerated 187 plantlets per 100 explants, and 74.4% of the regenerants were positive in transgene PCR. The callus regeneration method regenerated 20 plantlets per 100 explants, and 31.5% of them were PCR positive. Southern blotting confirmed the insertion of transgene in the plant host genome. The direct shoot formation method is more than 20-fold more efficient than previously reported transformation method in this species.",39
"Trehalose is not only an important disaccharide, but also a key stress resistance factor in the development of many organisms, including plants, bacteria, fungi, and insects. To study the potential function of trehalose in development and behaviour, cDNA for a trehalose-6-phosphate synthase from Catantops pinguis (CpiTPS) was cloned and sequenced. Results revealed that the CpiTPS cDNA sequence contains an open reading frame of 2430 nucleotides encoding a protein of 809 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 91.13 kDa and a pI value of 6.25. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses showed that CpiTPS mRNA expression was high in the fat body and testes, ovaries, Malpighian tubules, brain, trachea, rectum, and posterior extensor of C. pinguis. Northern blotting revealed that CpiTPS mRNA was expressed in the fat body at different developmental stages and was present at a high level in first instar larvae and adults. The results demonstrate that CpiTPS is a key gene in C. pinguis development.",38
"Background: Hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets (HVDRR) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene. Variable phenotypes have been associated with these mutations, and some of these were linked to the effects they have on the interacting partners of VDR, mainly the retinoic X receptor (RXR). Methods: We examined four patients with HVDRR from three unrelated Lebanese families. All parents were consanguineous with normal phenotype. We used Sanger sequencing to identify mutations in the coding exons of VDR. Results: Two homozygous mutations (p.R391S and p.H397P), both in exon 9 of the VDR gene, were identified. Phenotype/genotype association was not possible even for the same mutation. Alopecia was seen only with the p.R391S mutation. Despite a comparable rachitic bone disease, the patients showed different responsiveness to large doses of alfacalcidol (1-alpha-hydroxy vitamin D3) supplementation. Conclusions: This is the first report of VDR mutations in Lebanon with promising clinical outcomes despite the severity of the phenotypes.",34
"New mathematics has often been inspired by new insights into the natural world. Here we describe some ongoing and possible future interactions among the massive data sets being collected in neuroscience, methods for their analysis and mathematical models of the underlying, still largely uncharted neural substrates that generate these data. We start by recalling events that occurred in turbulence modelling when substantial space-time velocity field measurements and numerical simulations allowed a new perspective on the governing equations of fluid mechanics. While no analogous global mathematical model of neural processes exists, we argue that big data may enable validation or at least rejection of models at cellular to brain area scales and may illuminate connections among models. We give examples of such models and survey some relatively new experimental technologies, including optogenetics and functional imaging, that can report neural activity in live animals performing complex tasks. The search for analytical techniques for these data is already yielding new mathematics, and we believe their multi-scale nature may help relate well-established models, such as the Hodgkin-Huxley equations for single neurons, to more abstract models of neural circuits, brain areas and larger networks within the brain. In brief, we envisage a closer liaison, if not a marriage, between neuroscience and mathematics.",86
"This original prospective cohort study was conducted in an attempt to significantly reduce the incidence and the severity of injuries in an intervention cohort as compared to a two-season historical cohort, and to provide recommendations to the International Federation of Football (IFAF) pertaining to prevention measures to make the game safer. A total of 1,260 amateur male (mean age: 20.4 +/- 3.9 years) and 244 female (mean age: 18.5 +/- 1.7 years) players participated in the study. Four prevention measures were implemented: the no-pocket rule, self-fitting mouth guards, ankle braces (for those players with recurrent ankle sprains) and an injury treatment information brochure. All time-loss injuries sustained in game sessions were recorded by the off-the-field medical personnel and followed up by a more detailed phone injury surveillance questionnaire. There was a 54 % reduction in the total number of injuries and a significant reduction in the incidence rate and incidence proportion between the intervention cohorts as compared to the historical cohort (p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant reduction in the number of injuries in any of the body parts, except for in hand/wrist injuries related to the use of pockets (p < 0.001), as well as the severity of mild-moderate injuries (p < 0.05). This study provided evidence that hand/wrist injuries can be significantly reduced in flag football. Recommendations to the IFAF include strict enforcement of the no-pocket rule, the use of soft headgear, comfortable-fitting ankle braces and mouth guards and additionally, to change game rules concerning blocking.

"This paper proposes a numerical method for accurate time-domain noise simulation of mixed analogue/digital electrical circuits that in principle do not admit a periodic steady-state working condition, such as fractional sigma phase-locked loops (PLLs). By means of a tool known as saltation matrix, which allows dealing with non-smooth vector fields, a variational approach is adopted. The power spectral density of a noisy electrical variable is computed by applying the Thomson's multitaper method (MTM) to the numerical solution of the stochastic variational model of the circuit. This allows to resort to a single transient simulation run, thus avoiding cpu time consuming Monte-Carlo-like approaches. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by comparing simulation results related to a commercial fractional sigma PLL with experimental data.",45
"This paper describes the reinforcing effects of multiple layers of geocell in combination with rubber-soil mixture layers in sand, and compares their behaviour with that of the multilayered geocell reinforcement alone, using plate loading at a diameter of 300 mm. The plate load tests were performed in an outdoor test pit, dug in natural ground measuring 2000 x 2000 mm in plan and 700 mm in depth. The geocell used in the tests was non-perforated with pocket size 110 x 110 mm(2) and height 100 mm, fabricated from continuous polypropylene filaments as a nonwoven geotextile. The optimum embedded depth of the first layer of geocell and the vertical spacing of geocell layers were found to be approximately 0.2 times the footing diameter, and the optimum percentage of rubber replacement was found to be around 8% by weight of the soil mixture. Both bearing capacity increase and settlement reduction were highest when multiple layers of geocell and rubber reinforcement were used. Results show that the reinforcements' efficiency decreased as the number of reinforcement layers increased, particularly at low settlement ratios. Higher bearing capacity and lower settlement were achieved by replacing the layers beneath the geocell layers with the rubber-soil mixture. At a ratio of settlement to plate diameter of 2%, the values of bearing pressure were in the ratio 1:2.3:3 for, respectively, the unreinforced installation, the installation with three layers of geocell, and the installation with three layers of geocell and rubber-soil between the layers. The inclusion of the geocell layers reduces the vertical stress transferred down through the foundation bed by distributing the load over a wider area. For example, at the pressure of 550 kPa applied on the soil surface, the transferred pressure at the depth of 510 mm is about 48%, 34% and 27% for the reinforced bed with one, two and three layers of geocell, respectively, compared with the stress in the unreinforced bed. Furthermore, use of the combination of geocell and rubber-soil mixture layers is more effective than use of geocell layers only in reducing the stress transferred downwards. For example, 350 mm beneath a soil surface that carries a stress of 830 kPa, the vertical stress is 15% less when two geocell layers are combined with two rubber-soil mixture layers than when there are only two geocell layers.",93

"In this paper we proposed multi-stage algorithm of small wind turbine power plant control when it supports maximum extracted power independently on traditional tip speed ratio using the wind speed. We made measurements of wind turbine parameters on urban and prairie territories, showed the necessity of power controlling the turbine, and vindicated the efficiency of control of small wind turbines in urban regions. We also formulated the conditions and structure of microprocessor operation, described the algorithm of wind turbine power control showing the possible situations and states. Each state is described with the corresponding microcontroller response and activity. We showed the advantages of pulse width modulation (PWM) is converting the electric values.",51
"Each year 16-17 million determinations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are conducted and interpreted in Germany. Recently acquired data have led to a fundamental reassessment of the clinical significance of HDL-C. This review article is based on a selective literature search. Low HDLaEuroC levels usually indicate an increased cardiovascular risk, particularly in primary prevention but the epidemiological relationship between HDLaEuroC and the risk is complex. The HDL plays a role in the back transport and excretion of cholesterol; however, the biological functions of HDL are dependent on the protein and lipid composition, which is not reflected by the HDLaEuroC concentration. If the composition of HDL is pathologically altered it can also exert negative vascular effects. Compared with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), HDLaEuroC is of secondary importance for cardiovascular risk stratification and the calculation of the LDL-C:HDLaEuroC ratio is not useful for all patients. Low HDLaEuroC levels should prompt a search for additional metabolic and inflammatory pathologies. An increase in HDLaEuroC through lifestyle changes (e.g. smoking cessation and physical exercise) has positive effects and is recommended; however, HDLaEuroC is currently not a valid target for drug therapy.",26

"Inhibition of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) enzyme activity and prevention of advanced glycation end (AGE) products formation represents a reliable approach to achieve control over hyperglycemia and the associated pathogenesis of diabetic vascular complications. In the frames of this research study, several triazolo- and pyrazolotriazines were synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of AGE products formation, DPP4, glycogen phosphorylase and -glucosidase activities, as well as AGE cross-link breakers. From the two considered classes of heterocyclic compounds, the pyrazolotriazines showed the highest potency as antiglycating agents and DPP4 inhibitors. Structure-activity relationships (SAR) for these compounds, which can be considered as potential drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, were evaluated.",120
"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays an important role in the clinical expression of neuropsychiatric symptoms during systemic illness in health and neurological disease. Evidence from in vitro and preclinical in vivo studies indicate that systemic inflammation impairs blood-brain barrier function. In order to investigate this hypothesis, we evaluated the association between systemic inflammatory markers (leucocytes, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein) and BBB function (cerebrospinal fluid/ serum albumin ratio) in 1273 consecutive lumbar punctures. In the absence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) abnormality, systemic inflammation did not affect the CSF/serum albumin ratio. When CSF abnormality was present, systemic inflammation significantly predicted the CSF/serum albumin ratio. Amongst the systemic inflammatory markers, C-reactive protein was the predominant driver of this effect. Temporal analysis in this association study suggested causality. In conclusion, the diseased BBB has an increased susceptibility to systemic inflammation. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. This is an open access article under the CC BY license.",11
"Context: Kinesio taping (KT) is a taping technique extensively used in rehabilitation of sports injuries; however, the effect of KT on delayed-onset muscle soreness is not entirely clear. Objectives: To investigate the effect of kinesio tape on the quadriceps femoris on muscle pain, flexibility, and sprint performance after squat exercise. Design: Crossover study. Setting: University research laboratory. Participants: 19 female university students (age 21.0 +/- 1.2 y, weight 53.0 +/- 4.6 kg, height 164 +/- 4 cm). Main Outcome Measures: Pressure-pain threshold for quadriceps femoris was recorded using pressure algometry. Quadriceps femoris flexibility was measured as the range of motion of knee flexion with a stainless steel goniometer. Sprint-speed measurements were conducted using photocells placed at 0 and 20 m. All participants completed both conditions (KT application and no KT application) after a 1-wk washout period. Measurements were taken at baseline and 48 h postexercise. For the KT condition, KT was applied immediately before the exercise protocol and remained on the skin for 48 h. Results: Squat exercise reduced flexibility and increased pain and sprint time compared with baseline. KT application resulted in similar sprint time and muscle pain as the no-KT condition but maintained flexibility compared with baseline. Conclusions: KT application immediately before squat exercise has no effect on muscle pain and short sprint performance but maintains muscle flexibility at 2 days of recovery.",27
"Background/Objectives: Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease, which is associated with metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. Irisin is an adipokine and myokine that regulates the metabolic status during times of increased insulin sensitivity. In this study, we aimed to investigate changes in the serum level of irisin in psoriasis patients in comparison with participants who did not have any disease (control group). We hope the results of our study would also aid in establishing a protocol aimed at understanding the etiopathogenesis and treatment of psoriasis. Materials and methods: The study included 30 patients with psoriasis vulgaris, who presented to the dermatology outpatient clinic and were not receiving systemic treatment. The control group included voluntary participants who did not have any disease (n = 30). In addition to venous and salivary irisin levels, glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein levels, and Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance scores were measured in both control and patient groups. Results: Serum irisin and salivary irisin levels were significantly lower in the patient group compared with the control group (p < 0.05). In the patient group, serum irisin levels had a positive correlation with salivary irisin levels (r = 418; p = 0.022) and a negative correlation with Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (r = -437, p = 0.016) and Dermatological Life Quality Index (r = -424; p = 0.02) scores. Conclusion: This is the first study evaluating irisin levels in patients with psoriasis vulgaris in the literature. The results of our study show that serum and salivary irisin levels were significantly lower in the patient group when compared with the control group. Irisin levels in patients with severe psoriasis were low, suggesting that irisin may have a role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and may be a marker showing the severity of psoriasis, which could warn us against the development of insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus.

"Background: Trauma is commonly associated with substance-related problems, yet associations between specific substances and specific posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (PTSSs) are understudied. We hypothesized that substance-related problems are associated with PTSS severities, interpersonal traumas, and benzodiazepine prescriptions. Methods: Using a cross-sectional survey methodology in a consecutive sample of adult outpatients with trauma histories (n = 472), we used logistic regression to examine substance-related problems in general (primary, confirmatory analysis), as well as alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drug problems specifically (secondary, exploratory analyses) in relation to demographics, trauma type, PTSSs, and benzodiazepine prescriptions. Results: After adjusting for multiple testing, several factors were significantly associated with substance-related problems, particularly benzodiazepines (AOR = 2.78; 1.99 for alcohol, 2.42 for tobacco, 8.02 for illicit drugs), DSM-5 PTSD diagnosis (AOR = 1.92; 2.38 for alcohol, 2.00 for tobacco, 2.14 for illicit drugs), most PTSSs (especially negative beliefs, recklessness, and avoidance), and interpersonal traumas (e.g., assaults and child abuse). Conclusion: In this clinical sample, there were consistent and strong associations between several trauma-related variables and substance-related problems, consistent with our hypotheses. We discuss possible explanations and implications of these findings, which we hope will stimulate further research, and improve screening and treatment.",76

"The purpose of this study was to explore the health beliefs of migrant farmworkers parents by approaching and interviewing the sample population in a health clinic where they seek care for their children. It is impossible to plan, implement care, or create health care delivery models without knowledge of health beliefs. An understanding of parental health beliefs in the vulnerable population of migrant farmworkers will assure a more informed approach to health matters of their children, while also improving health care delivery and providing culturally specific health care models. Collecting data in locations historically proven to generate trust and respect supported the objectives of this research study and promoted direct engagement with a group that is often misunderstood and marginalized. Twenty migrant farmworkers parents were interviewed during growing season in the largely agricultural setting of Weld County, Colorado. Associated variables/phenomena determining health beliefs include parental decision-making regarding children's health maintenance, injury prevention, and health care. The overarching theme that emerged from the data was pride in having healthy children with major themes of respect, convenience and inhibition/suppression.",117
"To determine the efficacy of physiotherapy and behavior therapy and to find specific subgroups of women with overactive bladder syndrome that might gain increased benefit from this therapy. Women with ae10 micturitions per 24-h period were included. Six to nine therapy sessions were held within a 14-day interval. Efficacy end point was a reduction in micturitions and in episodes of nocturia. Secondary outcomes included ICIQ-OAB, ICIQ-OABqol and visual analog scales. Follow-up was 6 months. Levene test, Student's t test, PearsonA ' s and Spearman's correlations were utilized as well as the Friedman test and a multivariable-multilevel model. 32 women were included. Mean age was 51 +/- 15.9 (years +/- standard deviation, sd). Mean body mass index (BMI) was 24.4 +/- 4.8 (kg/m(2) +/- sd). There was a 22.9% reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 h (11.7 +/- 1.6 vs. 9.0 +/- 1.3 p < 0.001), a 21.3% reduction during the day (10.3 +/- 1.4 vs. 8.1 +/- 1.1 p < 0.001) and a 34.7% reduction in episodes of nocturia (1.5 +/- 1.0 vs. 1.0 +/- 0.8 p = 0.026). Both ICIQ-OAB (8.7 +/- 2.3 vs. 5.8 +/- 2.7 vs. 6.3 +/- 3.3 p < 0.001) and ICIQ-OABqol (73.4 +/- 25.9 vs. 47.5 +/- 14.5 vs. 47.7 +/- 18.6 p < 0.001) questionnaires as well as VAS (7.5 +/- 1.4 vs. 4.1 +/- 2.4 vs. 4.2 +/- 2.7 p < 0.001) showed significant improvement persisting in the 6-month follow-up. In addition, in a multivariable model controlling for age, women who were overactive bladder syndrome therapy na < ve responded significantly better than those who had already been under therapy (p < 0.001). This study shows the efficacy of physiotherapy and behavior therapy in women with overactive bladder syndrome with a post-therapy effect especially for women with no prior treatment.",17
This study investigated structural behavior of long-span partially earth-anchored cable-stayed bridges with a main span length of 810 m that use a new key segment closing method based on a thermal prestressing technique. A detailed construction sequence analysis matched with the free cantilever method (FCM) was performed using a three-dimensional finite element (FE) model of a partially earth-anchored cable-stayed bridge. The new method offers an effective way of connecting key segments by avoiding large movements resulting from the removal of the longitudinal restraint owing to the asymmetry of axial forces in the girders near the pylons. The new method develops new member forces through the process of heating the cantilever system before installing the key segment and cooling the system continuously after installing key segments. The resulting forces developed by the thermal process enhance the structural behavior of partially earth-anchored cable-stayed bridges owing to decreased axial forces in the girders.,97
This paper presents a temperature-compensated CMOS current reference with low line regulation current mirror. The circuit is based on a bandgap reference voltage that achieves the temperature compensation of resistor by the negative temperature coefficient (TC) of a high-resistance polysilicon (HR poly) resistor with the positive TC of an n-well resistor. The low line regulation current mirror is implemented by using a negative feedback connected operational amplifier. Prototypes of 1 mu A current reference from 0.35 mu m CMOS process show a maximum temperature coefficient of 139 ppm/A degrees C for a temperature range of 0-80 A degrees C. The line regulation is reduced to 0.5 %/V for supply voltage of 3.5 to 5.5 V.,60
"Material design is an important task in game and animation industry. It often requires artist's great efforts to create an elaborate material. Although several successful material editing systems already exist, it is still hard for artists to design a material on their own since these systems usually have neither an intuitive and sufficiently sophisticated material representation nor an artist-friendly editing interface. In this paper, we propose a simple material creation flow and develop a material design system based on an intuitive material representation. With the system, an artist can bring their creativity into play on designing materials that are realistic or imaginary.",79
"The 42 km of tunnels constructed using soft-ground pressure-balance tunnel-boring machines for London's new Elizabeth line were completed over a 3 year period. A single lining design solution was developed for all tunnels using a fully gasketed, steel-fibre-reinforced, concrete segmental lining suitable for use in all potential ground conditions anticipated along the alignment. The 14.8 pound billion Crossrail project faced many challenges, including dealing with significant quantities of different excavated material while minimising the environmental impact from transportation and disposal, minimising settlement effects and dealing with multiple tunnel-boring machine launches and receptions. This paper addresses how the issues were tackled and comments on the tunnel-boring machine design and the approach taken for survey control. Outline figures are also provided for the tunnelling rates. Finally, some conclusions and recommendations are made based on the observations and lessons learnt during the project.",85
"This paper presents a new realization of a first-order transadmittance-mode (TAM) all-pass filter (APF). In the proposed mixed-mode APF a simple transconductor, inverting voltage buffer, and unity-gain current follower are used as active building blocks. Considering the input intrinsic resistance of current follower as useful active filter parameter, the proposed TAM APF employs only a floating capacitor as external passive component. Hence, it is a resistorless circuit. In addition, due to high-impendence voltage input and high-impedance of output current terminal, it is fully cascadable filter realization. SPICE simulation results are included to support the theory. In the design the PTM 90 nm level-7 CMOS process BSIM3v3 parameters with low (+/- 0.5 V) DC voltages were used.",52
"At present, users can utilize an authenticated key agreement protocol in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) to securely obtain desired information, and numerous studies have investigated authentication techniques to construct efficient, robust WSNs. Chang et al. recently presented an authenticated key agreement mechanism for WSNs and claimed that their authentication mechanism can both prevent various types of attacks, as well as preserve security properties. However, we have discovered that Chang et al's method possesses some security weaknesses. First, their mechanism cannot guarantee protection against a password guessing attack, user impersonation attack or session key compromise. Second, the mechanism results in a high load on the gateway node because the gateway node should always maintain the verifier tables. Third, there is no session key verification process in the authentication phase. To this end, we describe how the previously-stated weaknesses occur and propose a security-enhanced version for WSNs. We present a detailed analysis of the security and performance of our authenticated key agreement mechanism, which not only enhances security compared to that of related schemes, but also takes efficiency into consideration.",57
"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence and rate of hospital-acquired pressure injuries (HAPIs) in pediatric patients. DESIGN: Descriptive, secondary analysis of 2012 data on pressure injuries among pediatric patients from the National Database for Nursing Quality Indicators (NDNQI). SUBJECTS AND SETTING: The sample included 39,984 patients 1 day to 18 years old from 678 pediatric acute care units (general pediatrics, pediatric critical care, neonatal intensive care, pediatric step-down, and pediatric rehabilitation units) in 271 US hospitals that submitted pressure injury data to the NDNQI for at least 3 quarters during 2012. RESULTS: The pressure injury prevalence was 1.4% and the prevalence of HAPI was 1.1%. The rate of HAPI among males was 1.06%, and the rate among females was 1.14%. HAPI rates were highest among children ages 9 to 18 years (1.6%) and 5 to 8 years (1.4%) and lowest among patients 1 to 30 days of age (0.72%). By unit type, HAPIs were highest among patients in pediatric critical care units (3.7%) and pediatric rehabilitation units (4.6%) and lowest in general pediatrics units (0.57%). Most of the HAPIs were Stage 1 and Stage 2 (65.6%); 14.3% were deep tissue pressure injuries and 10.1% were unstageable pressure injuries. CONCLUSION: Acutely ill children develop pressure injuries, including HAPI. Study findings provide data on HAPI from a large sample of hospitalized children and by pediatric unit type for comparison purposes.",114
"Objective. Children with clinically diagnosed juvenile psoriatic arthritis (JPsA) who were enrolled in the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) registry (CARRA-JPsA) were classified according to pediatric International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) and adult criteria [ Classification criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR)]. Data on demographic and clinical features at baseline and 1-year followup were analyzed and compared. Methods. Cross-sectional analysis was performed of CARRA-JPsA patients enrolled between May 2010 and December 2013 and stratified according to age at disease onset (= or >4 yrs). Features of patients fulfilling ILAR and CASPAR criteria were compared at baseline and followup using chi square, Fisher's exact, Mann-Whitney-McNemar, Wilcoxon signed rank, and t tests, as appropriate. Results. Among 361 children enrolled as CARRA-JPsA, 72.02% had symptom onset at >4 years of age, with a male predominance and high prevalence of enthesitis. At followup, statistically significant improvements were reported in arthritis, dactylitis, enthesitis, psoriasis, sacroiliitis, and nail pitting, but not in health questionnaire (HQ) scores. Of the patients, 80.5% fulfilled ILAR criteria for JPsA. Fifty-two patients, whose disease fulfilled CASPAR criteria but had not been included in the JPsA cohort, manifested more enthesitis, sacroiliitis, inflammatory bowel disease and uveitis and less psoriasis. Conclusion. The data support division of patients with JPsA into 2 clinical subgroups, according to age at disease onset. Improvement in objective findings did not correlate with changes in HQ scores. Pediatric rheumatologists currently do not diagnose JPsA in all children whose disease manifestations meet CASPAR criteria. Unification of adult and pediatric PsA classification criteria warrants consideration.",21
"A new large dynamic-range variable gain amplifier (VGA) with improved dB linearity is presented. The traditional cascade VGA has the disadvantages of gain mismatch between sub-stages and difficulty of employing mismatch cancelation or suppression algorithms. In this paper, switch arrays were used to make the sub-stages or called gain cells in the coarse-tuning stage (CTS) work independently and therefore prevent the integral operation of the gain errors. Then, a second-order mismatch-shaping DEM was applied conveniently to the CTS and shown to be a useful design technique in improving the dB-linearity performance. The cascade VGA and its second-order mismatch-shaping DEM had been integrated in a 2.4-GHz receiver chip which was fabricated in a 0.18-mu m CMOS technology with a supply voltage of 1.8V. Measurement results showed that the gain errors were significantly reduced with second-order mismatch-shaping DEM with respect to the traditionally thermometric decoding over a temperature range of [-40, 80] degrees C.

"Yellowwood (Cladrastis kentukea) grows in small, widely scattered populations in the wild, but is also a popular ornamental tree that thrives when planted in urban areas outside its natural range. Since the small native populations of yellowwood in several states are considered at risk of extirpation, the cultivated population could serve as an ex situ repository of yellowwood genetic diversity that could be used to restore lost local populations of the species. The potential value of cultivated yellowwood for conservation depends on the genetic diversity among cultivated trees compared to natural populations. Using nuclear microsatellite markers, we genotyped 180 yellowwoods from natural populations in Indiana, Missouri, Arkansas, and Kentucky, along with 61 trees from urban parks and landscapes in Indiana, Ohio, and Missouri. We found that, even when statistics were adjusted based on population size, the urban ""population"" had higher genetic diversity than any of the wild populations sampled, indicating that commercially-grown yellowwood is most likely a mixture of genotypes from isolated wild populations. We observed strong genetic differentiation among wild populations, and evidence for inbreeding in at least one of the wild populations.",34
"Computer programming is regarded as a difficult skill to learn both by researchers and often by learners themselves. Metacognition has been identified as an important factor to be a successful learner in learning computer programming. Metacognitive in educational psychology is generally described as monitoring and controlling activities of one's cognition. The researchers have examined the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory OM to identify how it relates to student academic achievement at school and universities. In this research work, an empirical research is conducted using the MAI inventory with the objective to examine the correlation between the metacognitive awareness with the Grade Point Average (GPA) performance of the introductory programming course at Universities in Malaysia. The experiment result indicates a positive relationship between metacognitive awareness with the learning success of introductory programming course at Universities.",40
"Alzheimer's disease patients display neuropathological lesions, including the accumulation of amyloid-beta (A beta) peptide and neurofibrillary tangles. Although the mechanisms causing the neurodegenerative process are largely unknown, increasing evidence highlights a critical role of immunity in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, we investigated the role of regulatory T cells (Tregs) on Alzheimer's disease progression. First, we explored the effect of Tregs (CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells) and Teffs (CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells) in an adoptive transfer model. Systemic transplantation of purified Tregs into 3xTg-AD mice improved cognitive function and reduced deposition of A beta plaques. In contrast, adoptive transfer of Teffs diminished behavioral function and cytokine production. Next, we transiently depleted Treg population using an anti-CD25 antibody (PC61). Depletion of Tregs for four months resulted in a marked aggravation of the spatial learning deficits of six-month-old 3xTg-AD mice. Additionally, it resulted in decreasing glucose metabolism, as assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) with F-18-2 fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([F-18] FDG) neuroimaging. Importantly, the deposition of A beta plaques and microglia/macrophage was increased in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions of the Treg depleted 3xTg-AD compared to the vehicle-treated 3xTg-AD group. Our finding suggested that systemic Treg administration ameliorates disease progression and could be an effective Alzheimer's disease treatment.",33
"Growing clinical and pre-clinical evidence points to a critical role for cannabidiol (CBD), the largest phytochemical component of cannabis, as a potential pharmacotherapy for various neuropsychiatric disorders. In contrast to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is associated with acute and neurodevelopmental pro-psychotic side-effects, CBD possesses no known psychoactive or dependence-producing properties. However, evidence has demonstrated that CBD strongly modulates the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system and may possess promising anti-psychotic properties. Despite the psychotropic differences between CBD and THC, little is known regarding their molecular and neuronal effects on the mesolimbic DA system, nor how these differential effects may relate to their potential pro vs. anti-psychotic properties. This review summarizes clinical and pre-clinical evidence demonstrating CBD's modulatory effects on DA activity states within the mesolimbic pathway, functional interactions with the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor system, and their downstream molecular signaling effects. Together with clinical evidence showing that CBD may normalize affective and cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia, CBD may represent a promising treatment for schizophrenia, acting through novel molecular and neuronal mesolimbic substrates.

"Security is an important problem in wireless sensor networks. Intrusion detection system is one of the most common methods of network security, for which more and more people have shown solicitude. In this paper, a dynamic random password authentication (DRPA) method is proposed for the identity authentication of communication nodes, which can detect and prevent malicious behavior at each stage of the network operation. This paper introduces the method of automatic generation of random passwords. When a user wants to communicate, the password will be verified to confirm whether it is a normal user or a malicious user. The passwords generation and verification process is very suitable for wireless sensor networks. By using NS2, the simulation experiments are carried out and the results show that this method is superior to the other methods.",46
"This paper is concerned with the problem of finding a sparse graph capturing the conditional dependence between the entries of a Gaussian random vector, where the only available information is a sample correlation matrix. A popular approach to address this problem is the graphical lasso technique, which employs a sparsity-promoting regularization term. This paper derives a simple condition under which the computationally-expensive graphical lasso behaves the same as the simple heuristic method of thresholding. This condition depends only on the solution of graphical lasso and makes no direct use of the sample correlation matrix or the regularization coefficient. It is proved that this condition is always satisfied if the solution of graphical lasso is close to its first-order Taylor approximation or equivalently the regularization term is relatively large. This condition is tested on several random problems, and it is shown that graphical lasso and the thresholding method lead to highly similar results in the case where a sparse graph is sought. We also conduct two case studies on brain connectivity networks of twenty subjects based on fMRI data and the topology identification of electrical circuits to support the findings of this work on the similarity of graphical lasso and thresholding.",45
"The well-known variable step-size least-mean-square (VSSLMS) algorithm provides faster convergence rate while maintaining lower mean-square error than the conventional LMS algorithm. The performance of the VSSLMS algorithm can be improved further in a channel estimation problem if the impulse response of the channel is sparse. Recently, a zero-attracting (ZA)-VSSLMS algorithm was proposed to exploit the sparsity of a channel. This was done by imposing an l(1) -norm penalty to the original cost function of the VSSLMS algorithm which utilizes the sparsity in the filter taps during the adaptation process. In this paper, we present the mean-square deviation (MSD) analysis of the ZA-VSSLMS algorithm. A steady-state MSD expression for the ZA-VSSLMS algorithm is derived. An upper bound of the zero-attractor controller (p) that provides the minimum MSD is also provided. Moreover, the effect of the noise distribution on the MSD performance is shown theoretically. It is shown that the theoretical and simulation results of the algorithm are in good agreement with a wide range of parameters, different channel, input signal, and noise types.",49
"Dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) is the main enzyme of a specific branch of the aspartate pathway leading to lysine biosynthesis in higher plants. We have cloned and characterized the DHDPS gene from Zizania latifolia Griseb, which was named ZlDHDPS. Sequence analysis indicates that it contains an ORF of 954 bp interrupted by two exons and one intron encoding a polypeptide of 317 amino acids lacking a plastid transit peptide and a stop codon. The sequence of ZlDHDPS has high identity with known plant DHDPS in GenBank. Southern blotting analysis indicates that there are two copies of Z. latifolia DHDPS (ZlDHDPS) gene in the Z. latifolia nuclear genome. RT-PCR analysis shows the expression of ZlDHDPS is tissue specific and high level expression is present in fast-growing tissue and reproductive tissue. The 5'-regulatory sequence of ZlDHDPS contains a GT-1 box and a (CA)n element, which may play a role in regulating the expression of ZlDHDPS. The fusion construct of the ZlDHDPS sequence with the reporter gene GUS was transiently expressed in the onion epidermal cells by particle gun-mediated bombardment suggesting that ZlDHDPS was located in the cytoplasm, different from DHDPS gene of other species. Functional complementary analysis showed that ZlDHDPS can recover the DHDPS-deleted mutant of Escherichia coli.",39
"A capillary electrophoresis (CE) method hyphenated with tandem mass spectrometry (triple quadrupole, QqQ MS) was developed for the simultaneous determination of six selected drugs used in Crohn's disease treatment, namely, azathioprine, 6-thioguanine, 6-mercaptopurine, mesalazine, prednisone, and allopurinol. A 10 mM ammonium acetate adjusted at pH 9 by 3% ammonium hydroxide and including a 5% methanol addition was used as an optimum background electrolyte (BGE). The optimum BGE provided both the baseline electrophoretic separation of the drugs and highly compatible connection of CE to the electro-spray ionization (ESI) interface. The optimized working conditions were favorable for the selective and sensitive QqQ MS detection of the separated compounds according to their mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios. The proposed method was validated in terms of precision (RSDs for the repeatability of migration times and peak areas of the analyzed drugs were less than 1.66 and 6.06%, respectively), linearity (determination coefficient ranged in the interval of 0.9987-0.9995), limits of quantitation (sub A mu g mL(-1) levels), and accuracy (mean recoveries of all the analytes in pharmaceutical matrix ranged in the interval of 98.23-101.2%). The CE-ESI-QqQ MS method is fast, simple, selective, precise, and accurate, and was successfully applied to a highly reliable determination of the targeted drugs (for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, IBD) in commercial pharmaceuticals (tablet dosage forms).",118
"Galectins are potent adhesion/growth-regulatory effectors with characteristic expression profiles. Understanding the molecular basis of gene regulation in each case requires detailed information on copy number of genes and sequence (s) of their promoter(s). Our report reveals plasticity in this respect between galectins and species. We here describe occurrence of a two-gene constellation for human galectin (Gal)-7 and define current extent of promoter-sequence divergence. Interestingly, cross-species genome analyses also detected single-copy display. Because the regulatory potential will then be different, extrapolations of expression profiles are precluded between respective species pairs. Gal-4 coding in chromosomal vicinity was found to be confined to one gene, whereas copy-number variation also applied to Gal-9. The example of rat Gal-9 teaches the lesson that the presence of multiple bands in Southern blotting despite a single-copy gene constellation is attributable to two pseudogenes. The documented copy-number variability should thus be taken into consideration when studying regulation of galectin genes, in a species and in comparison between species.",39
"Purpose of review The purpose of this review is to provide an update on osteoporosis epidemiology. The focus is on fractures because fractures are the most important clinical consequence of osteoporosis. Studies published over the past 18 months are identified and reviewed. Finally, the clinical impact of these new findings is discussed. Recent findings Important research in 2015-2016 include analyses of screening and rescreening in younger women and older men, risk factors for hip fractures in older men, obesity and weight loss/gain, and risk of fracture. Several dietary factors, including adherence to a Mediterranean diet and a diet rich in protein, fruits, and vegetables and maintenance of physical function with increasing age represent modifiable nonpharmacologic risk factors that improve bone health. Sarcopenia may have a more important role in fracture in men than women. Important biomarkers for fracture include low 25-hydroxyvitamin D and hemoglobin A1c. Summary Updated literature on fracture epidemiology have identified important risk factors for fracture.",16
"Background: Metastasis is a major cause of death in human colorectal cancer patients. However, the contribution of chemokines in the tumor microenvironment to tumor metastasis is not fully understood. Methods: Herein, we examinined several chemokines in colorectal cancer patients using chemokine ELISA array. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect expression of CXCL5 in colorectal cancer patients tissues. Human HCT116 and SW480 cell lines stably transfected with CXCL5, shCXCL5 and shCXCR2 lentivirus plasmids were used in our in vitro study. Immunoblot, immunofluorescence and transwell assay were used to examine the molecular biology and morphological changes in these cells. In addition, we used nude mice to detect the influence of CXCL5 on tumor metastasis in vivo. Results: We found that CXCL5 was overexpressed in tumor tissues and associated with advanced tumor stage as well as poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. We also demonstrated that CXCL5 was primarily expressed in the tumor cell cytoplasm and cell membranes, which may indicate that the CXCL5 was predominantly produced by cancer epithelial cells instead of fibroblasts in the tumor mesenchyme. Additionally, overexpression of CXCL5 enhanced the migration and invasion of colorectal cancer cells by inducing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through activation of the ERK/Elk-1/Snail pathway and the AKT/GSK3 beta/beta-catenin pathway in a CXCR2-dependent manner. The silencing of Snail and beta-catenin attenuated CXCL5/CXCR2-enhanced cell migration and invasion in vitro. The elevated expression of CXCL5 can also potentiate the metastasis of colorectal cancer cells to the liver in vivo in nude mice intrasplenic injection model. Conclusion: In conclusion, our findings support CXCL5 as a promoter of colorectal cancer metastasis and a predictor of poor clinical outcomes in colorectal cancer patients.",30
"Hydrological models and remote sensing evapotranspiration (ET) models usually are used to estimate regional ET. This study aims to integrate the advantages of both the models to simulate the daily ET processes. A compromise between these two methodologies is represented by improving the optimization of the hydrological model on the basis of a new probability optimal ET series, which is produced by a data assimilation scheme combining sparse remote estimates and continuous modeling of regional ETs. The distributed time-variant gain hydrological model (DTVGM) and a two-layer remote sensing ET model are chosen. First, the DTVGM is optimized by maximizing the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of daily streamflow in the Shahe River basin, and simulates the daily hydrological processes of 1999-2007. For improving the accuracy of continuous ET simulation, the DTVGM is further optimized by dual objective functions composed of the assimilated ETs and observed outlet discharge. The results show that the accuracy of the DTVGM-based daily ETs is improved after the dual optimization, and the mean absolute percentage error between the DTVGM-based ETs and the measured ETs in the study area is reduced by 5.84%. The integrated method is proved better, and improves the hydrology modeling accuracy.",94

"The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of black and green tea consumption on human metabolism. Seventeen healthy male volunteers consumed black tea, green tea, or caffeine in a randomized crossover study. Twenty-four-hour urine and blood plasma samples were analyzed by NMR-based metabonomics, that is, high-resolution H-1 NMR metabolic profiling combined with multivariate statistics. Green and black tea consumption resulted in similar increases in urinary excretion of hippuric acid and 1,3-dihydroxyphenyl-2-O-sulfate, both of which are end products of tea flavonoid degradation by colonic bacteria. Several unidentified aromatic metabolites were detected in urine specifically after green tea intake. Interestingly, green and black tea intake also had a different impact on endogenous metabolites in urine and plasma. Green tea intake caused a stronger increase in urinary excretion of several citric acid cycle intermediates, which suggests an effect of green tea flavanols on human oxidative energy metabolism and/or biosynthetic pathways.",32
"Background: Variants of unknown significance (VUSs) have been identified in BRCA1 and BRCA2 and account for the majority of all identified sequence alterations. Notably, VUSs occur disproportionately in people of African descent hampering breast cancer (BCa) management and prevention efforts in the population. Our study sought to identify and characterize mutations associated with increased risk of BCa at young age. Methods: In our study, the spectrum of mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 was enumerated in a cohort of 31 African American women of early age at onset breast cancer, with a family history of breast or cancer in general and/or with triple negative breast cancer. To improve the characterization of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants, bioinformatics tools were utilized to predict the potential function of each of the variants. Results: Using next generation sequencing methods and in silico analysis of variants, a total of 197 BRCA1 and 266 BRCA2 variants comprising 77 unique variants were identified in 31 patients. Of the 77 unique variants, one (1.3%) was a pathogenic frameshift mutation (rs80359304; BRCA2 Met591Ile), 13 (16.9%) were possibly pathogenic, 34 (44.2%) were benign, and 29 (37.7%) were VUSs. Genetic epidemiological approaches were used to determine the association with variant, haplotype, and phenotypes, such as age at diagnosis, family history of cancer and family history of breast cancer. There were 5 BRCA1 SNPs associated with age at diagnosis; rs1799966 (P=. 045; Log Additive model), rs16942 (P=. 033; Log Additive model), rs1799949 (P=. 058; Log Additive model), rs373413425 (P=. 040 and.023; Dominant and Log Additive models, respectively) and rs3765640 (P=. 033 Log Additive model). Additionally, a haplotype composed of all 5 SNPs was found to be significantly associated with younger age at diagnosis using linear regression modeling (P=.023). Specifically, the haplotype containing all the variant alleles was associated with older age at diagnosis (OR= 5.03 95% CI=. 91-9.14). Conclusions: Knowing a patient's BRCA mutation status is important for prevention and treatment decision-making. Improving the characterization of mutations will lead to better management, treatment, and BCa prevention efforts in African Americans who are disproportionately affected with aggressive BCa and may inform future precision medicine genomic-based clinical studies.",42
"The aim of this study was to investigate serum leptin and ghrelin levels and their relations with circulating cortisol, thyroid hormones, lipids, homocysteine (Hcy) and folic acid in dogs with compulsive tail chasing (CTC). The material of this study consists of fifteen dogs with CTC and 15 healthy controls of various weights, breeds, ages of both sexes were enrolled in the study. CTC was diagnosed on the basis of the dog's behavioral history, clinical signs, and results of other medical assessments. None of the dogs were considered to have concurrent medical disease that would account for CTC. Dogs with CTC had a higher leptin (8.3 +/- 0.9 ng/mL vs 1.7 +/- 0.2 ng/mL, P<0.001) and lower ghrelin levels (74 +/- 7 pg/mL vs 144 +/- 41 pg/mL, P<0.05) than those of healthy controls. Serum cortisol, lipids (cholesterol, phospholipids and NEFA) and Hcy levels increased (P<0.05), whereas serum folic acid decreased (P<0.001) in dogs with CTC as compared with controls. Serum ghrelin correlated negatively with cholesterol (P<0.05), but serum leptin correlated positively with cholesterol, fT4, and phospholipids (P<0.05). These results suggest that serum leptin and ghrelin levels may bring up a new perspective on our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms associated with CTC. Serum levels of both hormones may be associated with serum levels of lipids and free T4.",133
"In human leukaemia, resistance to chemotherapy leads to treatment ineffectiveness or failure. Previous studies have indicated that cancers with increased levels of aerobic glycolysis are insensitive to numerous forms of chemotherapy and respond poorly to radiotherapy. Whether glycolysis serves a key role in drug resistance of leukaemia cells remains unclear. The present study systematically investigated aerobic glycolytic alterations and regulation in K562/adriamycin (ADM) multidrug-resistant (MDR) and ADM-sensitive K562 leukaemia cells in normoxia, and the association between drug resistance and improper glycometabolism. The cell proliferating activity was assessed with an MTT colorimetric assay, glycolysis, including glucose consumption, lactate export and key-enzyme activity was determined by corresponding commercial testing kits. The expression levels of hexokinase-II (HK-II), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), glucose transporter-4 (GLUT-4), AKT, p-AKT473/308, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), p-mTOR, c-Myc and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) were analyzed by western blot or reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). K562/ADM cells exhibited increased glucose consumption and lactate accumulation, increased lactate dehydrogenase, hexokinase and pyruvate kinase activities, and reduced phosphofructokinase activity. In addition, K562/ADM cells expressed significantly more HK-II and GLUT-4. Notably, inhibition of glycolysis effectively killed sensitive and resistant leukaemia cells and potently restored the sensitivity of MDR cells to the anticancer agent ADM. The AKT serine/threonine kinase (AKT)/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway, a crucial regulator of glycometabolic homeostasis, mediated over-activation and upregulation of c-Myc expression levels in K562/ADM cells, which directly stimulated glucose consumption and enhanced glycolysis. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that MDR leukaemia cells exhibit increased aerobic glycolytic activity and that this may be responsible for resistance to chemotherapeutics in leukaemia MDR cells via activation of the AKT-mTOR-c-Myc signalling pathway. Therefore, inhibition of aerobic glycolysis may be a potential therapeutic strategy to efficiently treat multidrug resistance in relapsed or refractory leukaemia and cancers.",37
"Background Hepatosplenic schistosomiasis (HES) has not been evaluated by transient elastography so far and its correlation with ultrasound variables remains to be defined. Aims The aim of this study was to describe the parameters of liver and spleen stiffness in HES assessed by transient elastography in comparison with cirrhotics and controls evaluating its correlation with ultrasonographic data. Patients and methods HES, hepatitis C virus-cirrhotic, and control patients were included in this sectional study. Liver and spleen stiffness were compared among the three groups. The ultrasonographic parameters were compared with transient elastography in HES patients. Results Thirty HES, 30 hepatitis C virus-cirrhotic patients, and 17 controls were included. Those with HES presented liver stiffness that was significantly higher than the controls and lower than the cirrhotics: 9.7 (3.6-75.0) versus 3.7 (2.8-5.4) versus 27.0 (14.7-61.5) kPa (P < 0.001). Spleen stiffness values were comparable between hepatosplenic and cirrhotics: 66.4 (25.7-75.0) versus 69.1 (18.0-75.0) kPa (P = 0.78) and were significantly higher than the controls 16.5 kPa (6.3-34.3) (P < 0.001). In patients with HES, high spleen stiffness was associated with right liver lobe diameter (P = 0.015), splenic artery resistance index (P = 0.002), portal vein diameter (P = 0.021), portal vein area (P = 0.008), portal vein congestion index (P = 0.035), splenic vein diameter (P = 0.013), and spleen diameter (P = 0.021). Conclusion Liver stiffness may be a useful tool to differentiate portal hypertension related to cirrhosis from that of HES. High spleen stiffness is a potential surrogate marker of portal hypertension in this population. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",130
"Prenatal development is recognized as a critical period in the etiology of obesity and cardiometabolic disease. Potential strategies to reduce maternal obesity-induced risk later in life have been largely overlooked. In this paper, we first propose a conceptual framework for the role of public health and preventive medicine inmitigating the effects of fetal programming. Second, we review a small but growing body of research (through August 2015) that examines interactive effects of maternal obesity and two public health foci - diet and physical activity - in the offspring. Results of the review support the hypothesis that diet and physical activity after early life can attenuate disease susceptibility induced by maternal obesity, but human evidence is scant. Based on the review, we identify major gaps relevant for prevention research, such as characterizing the type and dose response of dietary and physical activity exposures that modify the adverse effects of maternal obesity in the offspring. Third, we discuss potential implications of interactions between maternal obesity and postnatal dietary and physical activity exposures for interventions to mitigate maternal obesity-induced risk among children. Our conceptual framework, evidence review, and future research directions offer a platform to develop, test, and implement fetal programming mitigation strategies for the current and future generations of children.

"Anaplastic thyroid cancer, medullary thyroid cancer, primary thyroid lymphoma and primary thyroid sarcoma are rare thyroid cancers that comprise 5-10% of all thyroid malignancies. Unlike well-differentiated thyroid cancers, these malignancies have few treatment options and carry a worse prognosis. The literature surrounding these pathologies is limited, but remains an area of active research. Despite the rarity of these conditions, they remain an important part of the differential diagnosis for any thyroid nodule. Awareness of their presentation, work-up and management is critical for oncologists and head and neck surgeons. The purpose of this article is to provide a broad overview of these malignancies with an emphasis on emerging clinical research and therapies. (C) 2017 The Royal College of Radiologists.

"Background: Nurse-Family Partnership is a nurse home visitation program that aims to improve the lives of young mothers and their children. The program focuses on women who are parenting for the first time and experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage. Nurse visits start as early in pregnancy as possible and continue until the child reaches age two years. The program has proven effective in the United States - improving children's mental health and development and maternal wellbeing, and showing long-term cost-effectiveness. But it is not known whether the same benefits will be obtained in Canada, where public services differ. The British Columbia Healthy Connections Project therefore involves a randomized controlled trial evaluating Nurse-Family Partnership's effectiveness compared with existing (usual) services in improving children's mental health and early development and mother's life circumstances. The trial's main aims are to: reduce childhood injuries by age two years (primary outcome indicator); reduce prenatal nicotine and alcohol use; improve child cognitive and language development and behaviour at age two years; and reduce subsequent pregnancies by 24 months postpartum. Potential explanatory factors such as maternal mental health (including self-efficacy) are also being assessed, as is the program's impact on exposure to intimate-partner violence. To inform future economic evaluation, data are also being collected on health and social service access and use. Methods/design: Eligible and consenting participants (N = 1040) are being recruited prior to 28 weeks gestation then individually randomized to receive existing services (comparison group) or Nurse-Family Partnership plus existing services (intervention group). Nurse-Family Partnership is being delivered following fidelity guidelines. Data are being collected during in person and telephone interviews at: baseline; 34-36 weeks gestation; and two, 10, 18 and 24 months postpartum. Additional data will be obtained via linkages from provincial datasets. Recruitment commenced in October 2013 and will continue for approximately three years. Discussion: This trial will provide important information about the generalizability of Nurse-Family Partnership to the Canadian context. Findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and shared with policymakers and practitioners through extensive public health collaborations already underway.",117
"Purpose - The focus of this paper is on environmental protection, specifically within the context of green building at institutions of higher education (IHEs). One major reason why many IHEs are not undertaking sustainable building policies is the barriers to adoption. The lack of efficiency caused by these barriers to adoption of campus green building will be examined. The purpose of this paper is to identify the common barriers to adoption of green building initiatives at IHEs from multiple stakeholder perspectives and propose possible solutions. Design/methodology/approach - The manuscript provides a general review of the lack of efficiency caused by the barriers to adoption of sustainable building policies at tertiary education institutions. Findings - Campus sustainable building policies face various barriers to adoption of green building policies. Campus sustainable building policies face various barriers to adoption. These include lack of awareness among many stakeholders, incentives, champions, understanding of financial considerations, and occupant satisfaction. These barriers can be addressed through review of student perceptions, encouraging knowledge gains at larger wealthier IHEs, campus planning, offering financial motivations, employing a campus sustainability officer, and marketing green campus building initiatives. However, every stakeholder needs to be part of the collaboration and incentivized in order to reduce these barriers. Practical implications - This manuscript should be helpful to campus community members as they are involved in crafting, implementing, and managing green building policies. As green building development is a contemporary issue among the higher education sector, this research should prove helpful to decision makers as it identifies barriers and solutions to these barriers. Furthermore, this research can assist practitioners when attempting to implement green building policies at their respective IHEs by helping them understand the barriers as well as potential solutions for these barriers to campus green building. Originality/value - This general review uncovers barriers to green building in the higher education sector; a sector which historically is dearth on green building research. Furthermore, solutions are offered to address and overcome these barriers from multiple stakeholder perspectives within this sector.",99
"The periaqueductal gray (PAG) has been commonly recognized as a downstream site in neural networks for the expression of a variety of behaviors and is thought to provide stereotyped responses. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that the PAG may exert more complex modulation of a number of behavioral responses and work as a unique hub supplying primal emotional tone to influence prosencephalic sites mediating complex aversive and appetitive responses. Of particular relevance, we review how the PAG is involved in influencing complex forms of defensive responses, such as circa-strike and risk assessment responses in animals. In addition, we discuss putative dorsal PAG ascending paths that are likely to convey information related to threatening events to cortico-hippocampal-amygdalar circuits involved in the processing of fear learning. Finally, we discuss the evidence supporting the role of the PAG in reward seeking and note that the lateral PAG is part of the circuitry related to goal-oriented responses mediating the motivation to hunt and perhaps drug seeking behavior.

"Purpose of reviewMore point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tests are becoming available for HIV diagnosis and treatment in resource-limited settings. These novel technologies have the potential to foster decentralized HIV care and treatment for the benefit of clinical laboratories, HIV clinics, and HIV-infected patients. There continue to be many business, technological, and operational challenges that limit product development and regulatory approval, which limits products available for the required operational and cost-effectiveness studies and delays policy adoption and implementation.Recent findingsAlthough the rapid HIV diagnostic test has been widely successful, the pathways for POC CD4(+) cell count and HIV viral load assay analyzers have been more challenging. We describe significant hurdles for product development, approval, and implementation, which include the business case, technical development, clinical impact, and integrating laboratory and clinical networks.SummaryThe objective of this review is to highlight the obstacles for developing and implementing appropriate strategies for POC HIV testing assays to improve the clinical services for HIV-infected patients in resource-limited settings.",132
"Cancer care continues to stress the US healthcare system with increases in life expectancy, cancer prevalence, and survivors' complex needs. These challenges are compounded by socioeconomic, racial, and cultural disparities that are associated with poor clinical outcomes. One innovative and resource-wise strategy to address this demand on the system is expanded use of telehealth. This paradigm has the potential to decrease healthcare and patient out-of-pocket costs and improve patient adherence to recommended treatment and/or surveillance.",8
"Background: Retrotransposons comprise a ubiquitous and abundant class of eukaryotic transposable elements. All members of this class rely on reverse transcriptase activity to produce a DNA copy of the element from the RNA template. However, other activities of the retrotransposon-encoded polyprotein may differ between diverse retrotransposons. The polyprotein domains corresponding to each of these activities may have their own evolutionary history independent from that of the reverse transcriptase, thus underlying the modular view on the evolution of retrotransposons. Furthermore, some transposable elements can independently evolve similar domain architectures by acquiring functionally similar but phylogenetically distinct modules. This convergent evolution of retrotransposons may ultimately suggest similar regulatory pathways underlying the lifecycle of the elements. Results: Here, we provide new examples of the convergent evolution of retrotransposons of species from two unrelated taxa: green plants and parasitic protozoan oomycetes. In the present study we first analyzed the available genomic sequences of oomycete species and characterized two groups of Ty3/Gypsy long terminal repeat retrotransposons, namely Chronos and Archon, and a subgroup of L1 non-long terminal repeat retrotransposons. The results demonstrated that the retroelements from these three groups each have independently acquired plant-related ribonuclease H domains. This process closely resembles the evolution of retrotransposons in the genomes of green plants. In addition, we showed that Chronos elements captured a chromodomain, mimicking the process of chromodomain acquisition by Chromoviruses, another group of Ty3/ Gypsy retrotransposons of plants, fungi, and vertebrates. Conclusions: Repeated and strikingly similar acquisitions of ribonuclease H domains and chromodomains by different retrotransposon groups from unrelated taxa indicate similar selection pressure acting on these elements. Thus, there are some major trends in the evolution of the structural composition of retrotransposons, and characterizing these trends may enhance the current understanding of the retrotransposon life cycle.",42
"Background: Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a fungal infection frequently observed in patients with immune dysfunction, such as those suffering from structural lung diseases. Nevertheless, studies assessing IPA combined with other common respiratory diseases remain scarce, particularly those regarding the immune status of its patients. Different structural lung diseases are known to differently affect patient immune status; however, the mechanisms by which this is conferred have yet to be determined. Thus, our study aims to compare the immune status of IPA patients with the structural lung diseases chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), interstitial lung disease (ILD) and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB). Methods: This study was performed retrospectively with data collected over the years 2004 to 2013 at Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University, and included 77 patients whose lower respiratory tract (LRT) samples tested positive for. Our analysis considered blood examinations of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD4+/CD8+, IgG, IgA and IgM levels. Results: CD4+/CD8+ double positive cells, representing cell-mediated immunity, were less abundant in IPA patients with COPD than those with ILD and NCFB (0.81+/-0.09 vs. 1.39+/-0.25 and 0.81+/-0.09 vs. 1.57+/-0.06, respectively, P<0.001). In agreement with this result, corticosteroid and broad-spectrum antibiotic use were most common in individuals with COPD (57%). IgA levels, which indicate humoral immunity, were lower in IPA patients with NCFB than those with COPD or ILD (0.95+/-0.28 vs. 1.64+/-0.40 g/L and 0.95+/-0.28 vs. 3.16+/-0.83 g/L, respectively, P<0.001). Conclusions: Immunity status differs between IPA patients with different structural lung diseases. Among IPA patients with COPD, ILD and NCFB, those with COPD have the lowest cell-mediated immunity, while those with NCFB have the lowest humoral immunity.",126
The tremendous growth in economic activity across the globe is placing pressure on natural and environmental resources. The rising concern for the environment in response to global warming is driving thinkers to seek sustainable solutions. The real estate industry is a significant contributor to the global warming due to extensive emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from the energy use in buildings. This indicates that there is a real opportunity to develop green buildings in the country. The concept of green building integrates interests and aspects of sustainability emphasising reduction of environmental impacts through a holistic approach to land and building uses and construction strategies. Many professionals associated with the building industry follow different guidelines depending upon the need of the project. A study was done to check awareness and knowledge of contractors in the areas of green buildings and sustainable development. This study was conducted in Delhi-NCR Regions. The methods used for data collection were interview schedule and group discussions. It was revealed that the knowledge of contractors is very low in the areas of green buildings and sustainable development. These findings reveal there is a need of trained professionals for construction of green buildings.,99
"Background: Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are present in approximately 15-50% individuals with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). They may be isolated but more often are multiple. The goal of this study was to evaluate the influence of PAVMs on lung mechanical properties. Methods: We reviewed the files of all adult patients (age >= 18 years) referred to our Center for evaluation of HHT between 2005 and 2013. The diagnosis of HHT was based on the Curacao criteria and/or the presence of a pathogenic mutation. Exclusion criteria included: chronic cardiac or lung disease (i.e. asthma or COPD), suspicion of pulmonary hypertension on echocardiography, current or past smoking (>10 pack-years), history of thoracic surgery, previous treatment of PAVMs by embolotherapy, lung infection or thromboembolic disease in the past 3 months, pregnancy and obesity (BMI >30 kg/m(2)). Chest high resolution CT-scan and pulmonary function tests were performed the same day in all patients as part of our routine work-up. Results: One hundred and fifty five patients with HHT were included (age: 44.4 +/- 16.7 yrs - mean +/- SD -; males: 39%). Eighty eight patients had no PAVM, 45 had 1-3 PAVMS and 22 had at least 4 PAVMs. Thirty eight patients had unilateral PAVMs and 29 bilateral PAVMs. We found no statistical relationship between the number, the size and the laterality of PAVMs and results of lung flows and volumes. Conclusion: We found no evidence that PAVMs have a significant influence on lung mechanical properties as measured using routine pulmonary function tests in adult patients with HHT, even in case of numerous, macroscopic or bilateral malformations.",109
"Background and purpose Pancreatic fistula after pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) is not uncommon, but few reports describe a stricture after pancreatogastrointestinalstomy. We investigated the clinical influence of anastomotic stricture caused by pancreatogastrointestinalstomy after PD. Methods The subjects of this prospective cohort study were 132 patients who underwent PD or pylorus-preserving PD. We reviewed the relationships between pancreatic duct dilatation of the remnant pancreas and several risk factors. We also compared pancreatic duct dilatation with pancreatic atrophy and analyzed nutrient parameters in the first postoperative year. Results Patients with a preoperative pancreatic duct diameter less than 3 mm had a significantly dilated postoperative pancreatic duct diameter (p = 0.0001). The average atrophy rate of the remnant pancreas was 26.3 %, with the lowest atrophy rate (7.3 %) seen in patients without pre- or postoperative pancreatic duct dilation. A normal pancreas in which pancreatic duct dilatation developed postoperatively had a high atrophy rate (34.9 %). Moreover, only patients without pre- or postoperative pancreatic dilatation gained body weight (3.9 %). Conclusions This study shows a significant correlation between pancreatic atrophy rate and weight loss. Atrophy of the remnant pancreas caused by anastomotic stricture influences the exocrine function of patients after PD. The anastomotic method must be improved to prevent pancreatic duct dilatation and allow for early diagnosis and management of stenotic lesions.",121
"Human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP), a major constituent of islet amyloid deposits, induces pancreatic -cell apoptosis and eventually contributes to -cell deficit in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this study, Tat-mediated transduction of biliverdin reductase A (BLVRA) was investigated in INS-1 cells to examine whether exogenous supplementation of BLVRA prevented hIAPP-induced apoptosis and dysfunction in insulin secretion in -cells. Tat-BLVRA fusion protein was efficiently delivered into INS-1 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Exposure of cells to hIAPP induced apoptotic cell death, which was dose-dependently inhibited by pre-treatment with Tat-BLVRA for 1h. Transduced Tat-BLVRA reduced hIAPP-evoked generation of reactive oxygen species, a crucial mediator of -cell destruction. Immunoblot analysis showed that Tat-BLVRA suppressed hIAPP-induced increase in the levels of proteins involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis signaling. Transduced Tat-BLVRA also recovered hIAPP-induced dysfunction in basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretions. These results suggested that transduced Tat-BLVRA enhanced the tolerance of -cells against IAPP-induced cytotoxicity by alleviating oxidative stress and ER stress. Therefore, Tat-mediated transduction of BLVRA may provide a potential tool to ameliorate -cell deficit in pancreas with T2DM.",120
"A globally convergent and fully coupled 3D inverse model for smart materials is presented. In practice, stress and field (electric, magnetic, or temperature) are applied to smart materials whereas strain and flux density (electric, magnetic, or temperature) are measured. We refer to constitutive models that follow this scheme as direct models. In certain design and control situations, however, inverse models are necessary in which the field and stress are found from specified flux density and strain. This inversion typically involves an iterative procedure, which may be prone to convergence issues. An inverse model approach is proposed for arbitrary smart materials. The inversion requirement is a continuous and second order differentiable direct model for any chosen smart material. The approach is globally convergent, which makes it ideal for use in finite element frameworks. The premise of the proposed iterative system model is to constitute a recursive correction formula based on second order approximations of a novel scalar error function which offers a faster convergence rate. A continuation approach is then used to achieve global convergence for arbitrary input parameters. Magnetostrictive Galfenol is chosen to illustrate the effectiveness of the inverse model, and compact analytical derivations of the Jacobian and Hessian matrices are presented. The convergence rate of the proposed approach is superior to that of an existing inverse model. Finally, the inverse model's robustness is demonstrated through integration of the model into a finite-element framework to simulate a magnetostrictive composite plate actuator in full 3D.

"The question of terrorism is becoming a principal problem which influences social safety. Terrorist acts are aimed at frightening people and destabilisation of normal functioning of the state. Terrorists are trying to achieve this goal by bombing civilians and public utility facilities including transport system facilities. One of the elements of a transport system is its infrastructure consisting of roads, railways and bridge facilities. This last element encompasses for example bridges, viaducts, flyovers and culverts. Taking into account the fact that bridge facilities are extremely sensitive to terrorist attacks, the authors of this article decided to focus on them in this study. The work presents an original method of damage risk assessment in engineering facilities in the aspect of potential terrorist attacks. The method is based on two selected multi-criteria optimisation methods. The subject of analyses were four selected bridge facilities. The results of the conducted research and analyses were risk assessments of selected bridges. An advantage of the presented solution is the possibility to justify the adopted hierarchy of decision variants. Using the proposed method one can obtain specific numerical values. They can be used in further analyses conducted on a wider scale and to build a hierarchized database of facilities prone to terrorist attacks.",102
"In this paper, we investigate joint beamforming and power allocation in multicell multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink networks. Our goal is to maximize the utility function defined as the ratio between the system weighted sum rate and the total power consumption subject to the users' quality of service requirements and per-base-station (BS) power constraints. The considered problem is nonconvex and its objective is in a fractional form. To circumvent this problem, we first resort to an virtual uplink formulations of the the primal problem by introducing an auxiliary variable and applying the uplink-downlink duality theory. By exploiting the analytic structure of the optimal beamformers in the dual uplink problem, an efficient algorithm is then developed to solve the considered problem. Furthermore, to reduce further the exchange overhead between coordinated BSs in a large-scale antenna system, an effective coordinated power allocation solution only based on statistical channel state information is reached by deriving the asymptotic optimization problem, which is used to obtain the power allocation in a long-term timescale. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed schemes and show that both the spectral efficiency and the energy efficiency can be simultaneously improved over traditional downlink coordinated schemes, especially in the middle-high transmit power region.",35
"In this paper two new high input-impedance voltage-mode first order all-pass filters are proposed. The first proposed circuit uses two DVCCs as the active elements, one floating capacitor and one grounded resistor as the passive elements. Due to grounded resistor the phase of the filter is electronically tunable. The second circuit requires two DVCCs as the active elements, one floating resistor and one grounded capacitor as passive elements. The utility and validity of the proposed circuits for analog signal processing applications are verified through PSPICE simulations using MOSIS 0.18 mu m CMOS technology process parameters.",52
"This paper investigates the effect of leader's relational transparency on follower organizational deviance through followers' perception of leader's behavioral integrity and their trust in leader. Multi-level modeling results from a multisource survey-based field-study with 24 hospitality student project teams (N=149) show that behavioral integrity mediates the relationship between leader's relational transparency and follower's trust in leader. Furthermore, multi-level path analysis suggests that leader's relational transparency, a team-level construct, exerts a cross-level effect on follower's organizational deviance through the mediating roles of behavioral integrity and follower's trust in leader. The study has yielded theoretical and practical implications that are useful for hospitality leaders. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",66
"A novel carbon monoxide (CO) sensor is fabricated based on quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) using commercial piezoelectric crystal, modified with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) through spin-coating technique. For this purpose, a 10.00 +/- 0.03-V alternative-current (AC) potential with frequency of 4.62 +/- 0.02 MHz as an optimum surface acoustic wave (SAW) is applied to the piezoelectric crystal (SAW device). To follow the linear correlation between mass difference and frequency gradient, a frequency-to-voltage converter is adopted using an integrated circuit. Output potential is then filtered by electrical high-pass filter, followed by 10 fold samplification using an operational amplifier and finally connection to a PC through a voltmeter. According to figures of merit, fabricated sensor is linear from 35 to 280 parts per million (ppm). Detection limit is also similar to 5.3 ppm. Relative standard deviation for six replicate analyses is 3.04%. Based on 90% of maximum response (t(90)), response time is 5.0 s. Recovery time is also evaluated to similar to 30 s at 1.0 atmosphere pressure. Calibration sensitivity is measured to 0.057 mV/ppm. No significant interference is observed, when introducing at least 500 folds of various foreign species in air as diluents. Reliability of the sensor is finally evaluated via determination of the CO in two samples.",60
"Background: Computational analysis of protein-protein interaction provided the crucial information to increase the binding affinity without a change in basic conformation. Several docking programs were used to predict the near-native poses of the protein-protein complex in 10 top-rankings. The universal criteria for discriminating the near-native pose are not available since there are several classes of recognition protein. Currently, the explicit criteria for identifying the near-native pose of ankyrin-protein complexes (APKs) have not been reported yet. Results: In this study, we established an ensemble computational model for discriminating the near-native docking pose of APKs named ""AnkPlex"". A dataset of APKs was generated from seven X-ray APKs, which consisted of 3 internal domains, using the reliable docking tool ZDOCK. The dataset was composed of 669 and 44,334 near-native and non-near-native poses, respectively, and it was used to generate eleven informative features. Subsequently, a re-scoring rank was generated by AnkPlex using a combination of a decision tree algorithm and logistic regression. AnkPlex achieved superior efficiency with >= 1 near-native complexes in the 10 top-rankings for nine X-ray complexes compared to ZDOCK, which only obtained six X-ray complexes. In addition, feature analysis demonstrated that the van der Waals feature was the dominant near-native pose out of the potential ankyrin-protein docking poses. Conclusion: The AnkPlex model achieved a success at predicting near-native docking poses and led to the discovery of informative characteristics that could further improve our understanding of the ankyrin-protein complex. Our computational study could be useful for predicting the near-native poses of binding proteins and desired targets, especially for ankyrin-protein complexes.

The aeroelastic behavior of suspension bridges under generic temporal and space wind distributions is studied employing a parametric one-dimensional structural model coupled with a strip-based indicial representation of the unsteady aerodynamic loads. The aeroelastic response to spatially nonuniform gusts is also investigated. The equations of motion linearized about the prestressed aerostatic equilibrium are expressed in terms of incremental kinematic variables. The aerodynamic loading characteristics of the deck cross sections of the Runyang Suspension Bridge (over the Yangtze river in China) are evaluated by means of computational fluid dynamics simulations performed to extract the aeroelastic derivatives from which the indicial aerodynamic representation is obtained. The aeroelastic equations of motion are then reduced to the state-space ordinary differential form by using the Faedo-Galerkin approach. The reduced-order bridge dynamics and the description of the aerodynamic loading via the added aerodynamic states are solved simultaneously by using a time-integration numerical scheme. Dependence of the flutter condition and the transient response to gusts is shown through systematic parametric studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.,97
"Composite lymphomas (CLs) are defined as two unrelated lymphomas occurring at the same time within the same tissue. The incidence of these tumors is low. Of all possible combinations between lymphomas, the least frequent are the ones combining peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). We recently identified five cases of CL composed of PTCL and classical HL, mixed cellularity type. We investigated histological and clinical features of these cases. Immunostaining was performed on paraffin sections. PTCL cells were positive for CD8 and TIA-1 in four of the five cases. Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells were positive for CD30 and weakly positive for PAX5 in all cases, positive for CD15 in three of five cases, positive for CD20 in one of five cases, and negative for EBER. Monoclonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor (TCR) and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) genes was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using whole paraffin sections. We concluded more precisely the monoclonality of the IGH rearrangement of HRS cells based on single-cell PCR for IGH and DNA sequencing analysis after laser microdissection of single cells in one case. HL can occur in CD8-positive and TIA-1-positive PTCL. Clinicians should recognize the possibility of these CL.",37
"In this paper an offline approach for output-only Bayesian identification of stochastic nonlinear systems is presented. The approach is based on a re-parameterization of the joint posterior distribution of the parameters that define a postulated state-space stochastic model class. In the re-parameterization the state predictive distribution is included, marginalized, and estimated recursively in a state estimation step using an unscented Kalman filter, bypassing state augmentation as required by existing online methods. In applications expectations of functions of the parameters are of interest, which requires the evaluation of potentially high-dimensional integrals; Markov chain Monte Carlo is adopted to sample the posterior distribution and estimate the expectations. The proposed approach is suitable for nonlinear systems subjected to non-stationary inputs whose realization is unknown, and that are modeled as stochastic processes. Numerical verification and experimental validation examples illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the approach, including: (i) an increased numerical stability with respect to augmented-state unscented Kalman filtering, avoiding divergence of the estimates when the forcing input is unmeasured; (ii) the ability to handle arbitrary prior and posterior distributions. The experimental validation of the approach is conducted using data from a large-scale structure tested on a shake table. It is shown that the approach is robust to inherent modeling errors in the desdription of the system and forcing input, providing accurate prediction of the dynamic response when the excitation history is unknown.

"This study explored stereotype constructions people may impute on to others in the context of a contagious disease epidemic. Participants were 30 undergraduate students from a large university in Johannesburg, South Africa. They completed the open-ended Build-A-Character Questionnaire, which described the ""typical"" person in South Africa who they currently believed to be at particular risk of HIV infection. The data were thematically analysed and interpreted. Seven themes resulted, based on the stereotyping of marginalised groups in South Africa considered as being at higher risk for HIV due to historical disadvantage: blacks, women, and the poor. A social cognitive framework explains these stereotypes as they apply to perceived out-groups, and they carry risk to undermine public health interventions regarding the HIV pandemic in South Africa across population segments.",61
"This study used latent profile analysis to develop coping typologies of 340, 14- to16-year-old Mexican American adolescents (M = 14.46, SD = 0.69). Three typologies were identified: (a) opposition coping (adolescents who tended to use anger and venting emotions), (b) support-seeking coping (adolescents who relied on seeking support), and (c) escape and opposition coping (adolescents who relied on anger, venting, substance-use coping, behavioral avoidance, and peer support). Three key parental behaviors (support, knowledge, psychological control) of mothers and fathers and adolescent gender were examined as predictors of the coping typologies. Results indicated that parental support and knowledge, particularly from mothers, predicted membership into the support-seeking coping typology relative to the other two typologies. Girls were more likely than boys to utilize support-seeking coping than opposition coping. Gender socialization norms that may have influenced these results are discussed.",18
The paper is devoted to the problem of fault detection in analog electrical circuits described by linear or nonlinear polynomial models. So-called data-driven method for fault detection is considered. This method assumes that parameters of the circuit under consideration may be unknown. It does not use methods of identification and allows checking whether or not parameters of some elements deviate considerably from their nominal values.,45
"Background: Prices of anti-cancer drugs are skyrocking. We aimed to assess the clinical benefit of new drugs for treating advanced solid tumors at the time of their approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and to search for a relation between price and clinical benefit of drugs. Materials and methods: We included all new molecular entities and new biologics for treating advanced solid cancer that were approved by the FDA between 2000 and 2015. The clinical benefit of drugs was graded based on FDA medical review of pivotal clinical trials using the 2016-updated of the American Society of Clinical Oncology Value Framework (ASCO-VF) and the European Society for Medical Oncology Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS). Characteristics of drugs and approvals were obtained from publicly available FDA documents and price was evaluated according to US Medicare, US Veterans Health Administration and United Kingdom market systems. Results: The FDA approved 51 new drugs for advanced solid cancer from 2000 to 2015; we could evaluate the value of 37 drugs (73%). By the ESMO-MCBS, five drugs (14%) were grade one (the lowest), nine (24%) grade two, 10 (27%) grade three, 11 (30%) grade four and two (5%) grade five (the highest). Thus, 13 drugs (35%) showed a meaningful clinical benefit (scale levels 4 and 5). By the ASCO-VF which had a range of 3.4-67, the median drug value was 37 (interquartile range 20-52). We found no relationship between clinical benefit and drug price (P = 0.9). No characteristic of drugs and of approval was significantly associated with clinical benefit. Conclusion: Many recently FDA-approved new cancer drugs did not have high clinical benefit as measured by current scales. We found no relation between the price of drugs and benefit to society and patients.",8
"Since the proposal of a fast learning algorithm for deep belief networks in 2006, the deep learning techniques have drawn ever-increasing research interests because of their inherent capability of overcoming the drawback of traditional algorithms dependent on hand-designed features. Deep learning approaches have also been found to be suitable for big data analysis with successful applications to computer vision, pattern recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. In this paper, we discuss some widely used deep learning architectures and their practical applications. An up-to-date overview is provided on four deep learning architectures, namely, autoencoder, convolutional neural network, deep belief network, and restricted Boltzmann machine. Different types of deep neural networks are surveyed and recent progresses are summarized. Applications of deep learning techniques on some selected areas (speech recognition, pattern recognition and computer vision) are highlighted. A list of future research topics are finally given with clear justifications.",0
"Introduction. Oral contraceptives (OC) are effective for birth control and have good cycle control and tolerability. However, the hormonal components could modify mood and libido. Aim. The aim of this study is to evaluate the genital vascular effects and sexual behavior of an OC containing 30 g ethinyl estradiol and 3 mg drospirenone in comparison with a flexible combined contraceptive vaginal ring. Methods. Forty women underwent a sonographic assessment of the clitoral anatomy and vascularization and were administered the McCoy Female Sexuality Questionnaire (MFSQ) and the Beck's Depression Inventory questionnaire (BDI). Estradiol, androstenedione, testosterone, and SHBG were assayed. Free Androgen Index (FAI) and Free Estrogen Index (FEI) were calculated. The patients were randomly submitted to OC (group I; n = 21) or vaginal ring (group II; n = 19). Main Outcome Measures. Ultrasonographic clitoral volume, pulsatility index (PI) of dorsal clitoral arteries, MFSQ, BDI, and hormonal and biochemical assays were analyzed. Results. After therapy, the testosterone levels were reduced in both groups, whereas estradiol decreased only in group I women. The SHBG increased in all the subjects, and both FAI and FEI decreased. The clitoral volume decreased in all the women. The PI of the dorsal clitoral artery increased only in patients on OC. The hormonal contraception was associated, in both studied groups, with a significant decrease of the two-factor Italian MFSQ score, which was more marked in OC users. In group I subjects, there was a reduction of the number of intercourse/week and a reduction of orgasm frequency during intercourse. The pain during intercourse worsened after OC use. The vaginal ring users reported a vaginal wetness. Conclusions. Six-month treatment with hormonal contraception is associated with a diminished MFSQ score. However, the frequency of sexual intercourse and orgasm was reduced only by the use of OC. The OC use was associated with increased pain during intercourse.",116
"A comparison of the performance of four full-scale aerated horizontal flow constructed wetlands was conducted to determine the efficacy of the technology on sites receiving high and variable ammonia loading rates not yet reported in the literature. Performance was assessed in terms of ammonia and solids removal, hydraulic conductivity and mixing patterns. The capability of systems to produce ammonium effluent concentrations <3 mgNH(4)(+)-N/L was observed across all sites in systems receiving variable loadings between 0.1 and 13.0 gNH(4)(+)-N/m(2)/d. Potential resilience issues were observed in relation to response to spike loadings posited to be due to an insufficient nitrifying population within the beds. Hydraulic conductivity and flow mixing patterns observed suggested deterioration of the reactor effective volume over time. Overall, the study demonstrates the efficacy of the technology where ammonium removal is required on small sites receiving high and variable flow rates, with adequate removal of organics and solids, but no significant benefit to the long term hydraulics of the system.",83
"Using a large survey of Czech high school students (n=1103), aged 15-20 years, this paper explores youth prejudice to a wide range of minority groups (n=21) where family, school, and community contexts are taken into account. General Structural Equation Models are used to explore the determinants of prejudice for 21 minorities using a comparative explanatory framework where the focus is gender differences in prejudice to minorities are examined using three social theories: Social Dominance Theory (SDT), the Theory of Gendered Prejudice (TGP), and Gender Role Beliefs (GRB). This research shows that gender plays a strong role in expressing prejudiced attitudes where females express (a) less prejudiced attitudes toward the Roma, black Africans, Gays and those with mental or physical disabilities, and (b) more prejudiced attitudes towards the homeless, Vietnamese, Muslims, and lesbians. This gendered pattern is explained in terms of insights from SDT, TGP, and GRB.",61
"This paper investigates the influence of the measurement accuracy of the wind sensors on a wind energy conversion system (WECS) performance. Specifically, the wind speed and direction sensors installed at the end of the nacelle of a three blades horizontal axis wind turbine are considered. Due to the turbulence in the wake behind the wind turbine blades, wind direction measurement is highly affected; whereas, satisfactorily accurate measurement of the wind speed can be obtained from sensors at the rear part of the turbine. Moreover, any discrepancy caused by the rotating rotor at the wind speed measurement is known with satisfactory accuracy from the rotor aerodynamic model and thus, can be taken into consideration in the processing of the data obtained. Therefore, if the required information for both MPPT and yawing control is obtained by the wind speed, WECS can be driven to a satisfactory performance. On the contrary, if WECS operation and specifically yawing control is based on direct wind direction measurement with sensors installed at the rear part of the nacelle, may result to high discrepancies from the optimum performance. Thus, a combined control technique of accurate MPPT, optimization of the electrical generator efficiency and reliable yaw control can provide maximum electric energy production of the WECS and reduction of the cut-in wind speed towards the low wind speed range. Several simulation results are presented in order to demonstrate the effectiveness and operational improvement of the suggested control scheme.",52
"In the present study, we tested whether children's play with feminine toys is related to social abilities in which girls typically excel. We measured gender-typed toy play, empathy, and comforting skill in 80 Grade 1 children (about 6 years-old) in Hong Kong, China. Toy play was assessed with a standard observational paradigm; empathy, with the Empathy Quotient-Child Questionnaire; and comforting skill, with an infant-cry paradigm requiring the generation of comforting strategies. As predicted, boys and girls differed in their preferences for play with masculine and feminine toys, but not for gender-neutral toys. Importantly, toy play was related to comforting skill. Girls scored higher on the comforting task, and girls who played more with feminine toys and boys who played more with gender-neutral toys generated more comforting strategies. Regression and mediational analyses also suggested a stronger role of gender-typed play on comforting than the other way round. Contrary to hypothesis, there was no gender difference in empathy, and no relationship between empathy and toy play. These results extend previous understandings of the link between play and development and suggest that early gender-typed experiences may have long-term consequences for the development of some social skills.",65
"There is a large amount of variables that need to be taken into account when studying the effects of violent content in digital games; one of those being difficulty. In the current study participants played a modified first-person shooter in one of four different conditions, with either high or low difficulty and high or low violent game content. We assessed number of kills and number of deaths as game performance. Neither the difficulty nor the displayed violence had an effect on psychophysiological arousal during play, post-game aggressive cognitions, nor aggressive behavior. Thus, this study corroborates previous research indicating that violence in games does not substantially influence human behavior or experience, and other game characteristics deserve more attention in game effects studies. In addition, findings showed that challenge manipulated by game difficulty is of main importance for post-game emotions: Number of deaths predicted positive affect, but only in the low difficulty condition while number of kills was a positive predictor for positive affect and a negative predictor for negative affect.

"Nonlinear least-squares regression is a valuable tool for gaining chemical insights into complex systems. Yet, the success of nonlinear regression as measured by residual sum of squares (RSS), correlation, and reproducibility of fit parameters strongly depends on the availability of a good initial solution. Without such, iterative algorithms quickly become trapped in an unfavorable local RSS-minimum. For determining an initial solution, a high-dimensional parameter space needs to be screened, a process that is very time-consuming but can be parallelized. Another advantage of parallelization is equally important: After determining initial solutions, the used processors can be tasked to each optimize an initial guess. Even if several of these optimizations become stuck in a shallow local RSS-minimum, other processors continue and improve the regression outcome. A software package for parallel processing-based constrained nonlinear regression (RegressionLab) has been developed, implemented, and tested on a variety of hardware configurations. As proof-of-principle, microalgae to environment interactions have been studied by infrared attenuated total reflection spectroscopy. Additionally, light microscopy has been used to monitor cell production. It is shown that spectroscopic data sets with 10,000s of data points and >1000 nonlinear model parameters as well as imaging data with 100,000s of data points and >2000 nonlinear model parameters may now be investigated by constrained nonlinear regression. Acceleration factors of up to 8.1 have been obtained which is of high practical relevance when computations take weeks on single-processor machines. Solely using parallel processing, the RSS values may be improved up to a factor of 5.5.",101
"Temporary organizations such as projects are known to differ in various respects from permanent ones and have been argued to be more gender-neutral. Inspired by gender research in permanent organizations, we show that (in)congruency between gender and project roles evokes similar mechanisms in both permanent and temporary systems. Using the example of cooperative behavior, operationalized as project citizenship behavior (PCB), we examine how temporary organizations reward such behaviour. A cross-sectional study was conducted, with 241 project managers and workers participating. The results of seven structural equation models reveal that though the enactment of PCB does not vary by gender, the relationship of PCB with its outcomes does: men and women were clearly rewarded differently depending on the gender congruency of their project roles.

"Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the contribution of lymphatic tissue to heterotopic ossification (HO). Background: HO is the pathologic development of ectopic bone within soft tissues often following severe trauma. Characterization of the tissue niche supporting HO is critical to identifying therapies directed against this condition. Lymphangiogenesis is upregulated during incidents of trauma, thereby coincident with the niche supportive of HO. We hypothesized that lymphatic tissues play a critical role in HO formation. Methods: Mice underwent hindlimb Achilles' tendon transection and dorsal burn injury (burn/tenotomy) to induce HO. The popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes were excised ipsilateral to the tenotomy site. Flow cytometry and immunostaining were used to quantify and localize lymphoendothelium. MicroCT was used to quantify HO. Results: Enrichment of mature lymphatic tissues was noted 2 weeks after injury at the tendon transection sites when compared with the contralateral, intact tendon based on LYVE1+ tubules (10.9% vs 0.8%, P < 0.05). Excision of the inguinal and popliteal nodes with draining popliteal lymphatic vessel significantly decreased the presence of mature lymphoendothelium 2 weeks after injury (10.9% vs 3.3%, P < 0.05). Bone-cartilage-stromal progenitor cells (CD105+/AlphaV+/Tie2-/CD45-/CD90-/BP1-) were also significantly decreased after lymph node excision (10.2% vs 0.5%, P < 0.05). A significant decrease was noted in the volume of de novo HOpresent within the soft tissues (0.12 mm(3) vs 0.02 mm(3)). Conclusion: These findings suggest that lymphatic vessels are intimately linked with the de novo formation bone within soft tissues following trauma, and their presence may facilitate bone formation.",33
"Objective: To explore serum caveolin-3 (Cav-3) levels in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and to evaluate the role of Cav-3 as a biomarker for AF and incident heart failure (HF). Methods: Three hundred and five patients were enrolled in the study and divided into three groups: sinus rhythm (Group SR), paroxysmal AF (Group paAF), and persistent AF (Group peAF). Serum Cav-3 concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at baseline. Clinical characteristics, and laboratory data were collected during hospitalization, and a follow-up of 12-months was carried out. Results: Serum Cav-3 concentrations were significantly decreased on the Group SR and the highest concentrations of Cav-3 in patients were found on the Group peAF (516.7 +/- 274.0 vs. 609.3 +/- 287.0 vs. 688.3 +/- 264.6 ng/L, P= 703). In further tertile studies, subjects in the lower tertile of Cav-3 concentrations were more likely to become paroxysmal AF and had much lower LAD (P < 0.05). And in the middle and upper tertiles, participants with AF tended to suffer from HF compared to the lower group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: We provide evidence that Cav-3 has a significant meaning in AF patients. The levels of Cav-3 may be related to the LAD and new-onset HF.",111
"While planning resource management systems in rural areas, it is important to consider criteria that are specific to the local social conditions. Such criteria might change from one region to another and are hence best identified using a participatory approach. In this work, we propose a participatory framework to identify such criteria and derive their weights. These identified criteria and their weights are used as parameters to develop a quantitative model for evaluating efficiency of each system. Such a model can serve as a support tool for stakeholders to simulate and analyze what-if scenarios, evaluate alternatives, and select one which best satisfies their requirements. We use existing systems to test the model by comparing efficiencies evaluated by the model to efficiencies perceived by the stakeholders. The model is calibrated by repeating the process until statistically significant correlation is achieved between evaluated and perceived efficiencies. The novelty of the proposed framework lies in treating efficiencies perceived by the stakeholders as the ground truth since they know these systems well and are their ultimate users. The framework is successfully demonstrated using case study of rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems in an Indian village. The resulting calibrated model can be used to plan new RWH systems in this region and similar regions elsewhere. The framework can be used to plan other resource management systems in various regions.",95
"To evaluate the associations between Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) Alternative Model of Personality Disorder traits and domains and categorically diagnosed narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) and borderline personality disorder (BPD), respectively, 238 inpatient and outpatient participants who were consecutively admitted to the Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy Unit of San Raffaele Hospital inMilan, Italy, were administered the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5) and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders (SCID-II). Based on SCID-II, the participants were assigned to the following groups: a) NPD (n = 49), b) BPD (n = 32), c) any other PD (n = 91), and d) no PD (n = 63). Emotional lability, separation insecurity, depressivity, impulsivity, risk taking, and hostility were significantly associated with BPD diagnosis. Attention seeking significantly discriminated participants who received an SCID-II categorical NPD diagnosis. Separation insecurity, impulsivity, distractibility, and perceptual dysregulation were the DSM-5 traits that significantly discriminated BPD participants. Domain-level analyses confirmed and extended trait-level findings.",70
"Due to the fact biological processes occur in an aqueous environment, the interactions between biomolecules and water are of fundamental importance. Among these interactions proton transfer is an intriguing and essential process, which is carried out through a coordinated and cooperative motion of water molecules. Here, we use dielectric spectroscopy to measure the relative permittivity and dielectric loss for different amino acid solutions in the region of low frequencies (100 Hz-1 MHz). We found that in the case of L-glutamic acid there is a fast transfer of charge possibly facilitated through proton wires. A similar behaviour is obtained for ovalbumin where L-glutamic acid is an important constituent. Our findings could shed light to improve our understanding of water-biomolecules interactions, which drive the main functions of a cell. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",31
"Replication of the human papillomavirus (HPV) double-stranded DNA genome is accomplished by the two viral proteins E1 and E2 in concert with host DNA replication factors. HPV DNA replication is an established model of eukaryotic DNA replication and a potential target for antiviral therapy. Assays to measure the transient replication of HPV DNA in transfected cells have been developed, which rely on a plasmid carrying the viral origin of DNA replication (ori) together with expression vectors for E1 and E2. Replication of the ori-plasmid is typically measured by Southern blotting or PCR analysis of newly replicated DNA (i.e., DpnI digested DNA) several days post-transfection. Although extremely valuable, these assays have been difficult to perform in a high-throughput and quantitative manner. Here, we describe a modified version of the transient DNA replication assay that circumvents these limitations by incorporating a firefly luciferase expression cassette in cis of the ori. Replication of this ori-plasmid by E1 and E2 results in increased levels of firefly luciferase activity that can be accurately quantified and normalized to those of Renilla luciferase expressed from a control plasmid, thus obviating the need for DNA extraction, digestion, and analysis. We provide a detailed protocol for performing the HPV type 31 DNA replication assay in a 96-well plate format suitable for small-molecule screening and EC50 determinations. The quantitative and high-throughput nature of the assay should greatly facilitate the study of HPV DNA replication and the identification of inhibitors thereof.",39
"Objectives: Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection is associated with neurological abnormalities, such as HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and peripheral neuropathy (PN). Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide, and causes PN in approximately 9% of patients. Because the interplay between these potentially neuropathogenic viruses in the same individual is still poorly understood, the clinical and laboratory outcomes of co-infected patients were evaluated and compared with those of controls. Methods: The prevalence rates of neurological and laboratory abnormalities were evaluated in HCV/HTLV-1 co-infected patients (n = 50), and in subjects with single HCV (n = 46) or HTLV-1 (n = 150) infection. Results: A higher frequency of isolated PN was present in HCV-infected patients; this was not associated with cryoglobulinemia. No difference was found in the frequency of PN or HAM/TSP when co-infected subjects were compared to singly infected subjects. Hepatic involvement was present in HCV-infected subjects, as shown by increased levels of serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and bilirubin, in addition to thrombocytopenia. On the other hand, HCV/HTLV- 1 co-infected individuals presented a better prognosis for hepatic involvement when compared with singly HCV-infected subjects. Conclusions: These data suggest that HCV/HTLV-1 co-infection does not mutualistically alter the outcome with regard to neurological manifestations. Nonetheless, changes in the immunological environment induced by HTLV-1 infection could lead to a reduction in hepatic damage, even without significant HCV clearance.

"Recently we have used reductionist and integrative approaches as pioneered by the seminal work of Sanguinetti and Keating to link human arrhythmias with gene mutations that alter the biophysical activity of channel proteins. But as we begin to seek new methodologies to treat heart disease, we are faced with a myriad of data that clearly simple cell-based assays or culture models cannot address on their own. Is it time to change course?",129
"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an invasive form of hepatic cancer arising from the accumulation of multiple genetic alterations. In this study, the causal role of disturbed canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway was approved, and some of HCC-driven important gene candidates were determined. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs, are the key regulators of important cancer genes, and their participation in tumorigenesis has been shown. By reviewing literature, WNT1 gene with functional significance was selected to approve miRNAs as new subjects for targeted therapy. For proper and fast miRNA detection and also confirmation of the role of bioinformatics in obtaining practical data, we benefited from different bioinformatics tools such as TargetScan, miRanda, and DIANA. In order to use an HCC model, we used HepG2 cell line. Luciferase assay was applied to assess the ability of the selected miRNAs in targeting WNT1 3'-UTR. To overexpress the selected miRNA in HepG2 cell line, viral construct was prepared. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to evaluate selected miRNA and target gene expression levels. miR-122 was selected according to data concerning various bioinformatics tools. miR-122 was downregulated and WNT1 gene expression was upregulated in HepG2 cell line. After viral construct transduction, miR-122 expression was elevated and WNT1 expression was notably declined. Finally, we introduced WNT1 gene as one of the important genes in HCC, and also, we showed that miR-122 can regulate WNT1 gene expression. Moreover, our study determines the potential of bioinformatics analyses in providing accurate and reliable data for miRNA: messenger RNA (mRNA) prediction.",42
"African Americans (AAs) who use cocaine in the Southern region of the U.S. have a relatively high risk of HIV and need for HIV testing. Among this group, those residing in rural areas may have less favorable opinions about common HIV testing sites, which could inhibit HIV testing. We examined rural/urban variations in their acceptability of multiple HIV testing sites (private physician clinic, local health department, community health center, community HIV fair, hospital emergency department, blood plasma donation center, drug abuse treatment facility, and mobile van or community outreach worker). Results from partial proportional odds and logistic regression analyses indicate that rural AA who use cocaine have lower odds of viewing local health departments (OR = 0.09, 95 % CI = 0.03-0.21), physician offices (OR = 0.19, 95 % CI = 0.09-0.42), and drug use treatment centers (OR = 0.49; 95 % CI = 0.30-0.80) as acceptable relative to their urban counterparts. The findings have implications for further targeting HIV testing toward AAs who use of cocaine, particularly those residing in the rural South.",132
"Physical activity (PA) is increasingly recognised as an important factor within studies of osteoarthritis (OA). However, subjective methods used to assess PA are highly variable and have not been developed for use within studies of OA, which creates difficulties when comparing and interpreting PA data in OA research. The aim of this study was, therefore, to gain expert agreement on the appropriate methods to harmonise PA data among existing population cohorts to enable the investigation of the association of PA and OA. The definition of PA in an OA context and methods of harmonization were established via an international expert consensus meeting and modified Delphi exercise using a geographically diverse committee selected on the basis of individual expertise in physical activity, exercise medicine, and OA. Agreement was met for all aims of study: (1) The use of Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) minutes per week (MET-min/week) as a method for harmonising PA variables among cohorts; (2) The determination of methods for treating missing components of MET-min/week calculation; a value will be produced from comparable activities within a representative cohort; (3) Exclusion of the domain of occupation from total MET-min/week; (4) The need for a specific measure of joint loading of an activity in addition to intensity and time, in studies of diseases, such as OA. This study has developed a systematic method to classify and harmonise PA in existing OA cohorts. It also provides minimum requirements for future studies intending to include subjective PA measures.",15
"To prospectively investigate how Buscopan affects the diagnosis of bowel inflammation by diffusion-weighted imaging MR enterography (DWI-MRE) in Crohn's disease (CD). Thirty CD patients without previous bowel surgery underwent DWI-MRE (b = 900 sec/mm(2)) before and after intravenous Buscopan. The 30 patients were randomly divided into two groups; using a crossover design, interpretations were made regarding the presence of restricted mural diffusion (i.e., bowel inflammation) in nine bowel segments in two separate reading sessions by two readers. The readers also judged restricted mural diffusion extent in each bowel segment on two side-by-side DWI-MRE images with a random right-to-left order. Ileocolonoscopy and conventional MRE interpreted by an expert panel were reference standards. We analyzed 262 bowel segments. DWI-MRE without Buscopan significantly decreased sensitivity for both readers (58.8 % vs. 72.9 %, P = 0.046; 57.6 % vs. 85.9 %, P = 0.001) and did not significantly increase specificity (P = 0.085 and 0.396). Two readers noted that 28.6 % and 23.3 % of 262 bowel segments had greater diffusion restriction extent on DWI-MRE with Buscopan compared with DWI-MRE without Buscopan (P < 0.001) and 68.7 % and 74 %, respectively, had similar extent between them. Omitting Buscopan caused a greater loss in sensitivity of DWI-MRE than false-positive reduction for diagnosing bowel inflammation in CD. aEuro cent Omitting Buscopan significantly decreases DWI-MRE sensitivity for diagnosing bowel inflammation in CD. aEuro cent Increase in the corresponding DWI-MRE specificity by omitting Buscopan is less apparent. aEuro cent DWI-MRE without Buscopan underestimates the extent of bowel inflammation in CD.",118

"Aim In the Netherlands, preventive child healthcare workers (PCHWs) have an important role in identifying signs of abuse, because they reach virtually all children. A closer cooperation of PCHWs and forensic physicians could improve the detection of child abuse. The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of forensic expertise by PCHWs. Subjects and methods In November 2013, a survey was distributed among PCHWs employed by the Amsterdam Public Health Service (n = 221). Results Forty-nine percent of PCHWs indicated suspicions of physical abuse during the last 6 months (response rate: 43 %). In all, 89 % rated the consultation of forensic physicians as useful. In a 1-year period, only three respondents sought advice from a forensic doctor. Conclusions Although PCHWs regularly have suspicions of physical child abuse and have a very positive attitude towards consulting a forensic physician, consultation rates are very low. More research is needed to understand barriers to consultation of forensic physicians.",76
"For over forty years, relational databases have been the leading model for data storage, retrieval and management. However, due to increasing needs for scalability and performance, alternative systems have started being developed, namely NoSQL technology. With increased interest in NoSQL technology, as well as more use case scenarios, over the last few years these databases have been more frequently evaluated and compared. It is necessary to find if all the possibilities and characteristics of non-relational technology have been disclosed. While most papers perform mostly performance evaluation using standard benchmarks, it is nevertheless important to notice that real world scenarios, with real enterprise data, do not function solely based on performance. In this paper, we have gathered a concise and up-to-date comparison of NoSQL engines, their most beneficial use case scenarios from the software engineer viewpoint, their advantages and drawbacks by surveying the currently available literature.",112
"To response to the increasing demands for clean water, a large pressurized water reactor (PWR) with a desalination capability has been studied and demonstrated its potential so far. However, the electricity production of the large nuclear reactor decreases by 10% due to steam bypass for desalination. In this study, the authors evaluate the possibility of a large PWR with a capability of producing both electric power and clean water by using the supercritical CO2 (S-CO2) Brayton cycle technology. The S-CO2 power technology is adopted to minimize the decrease in the electricity production capacity due to desalination process. Two concepts which replace the existing steam based power conversion system with a S-CO2 Brayton cycle were proposed. The first concept is that the low pressure steam turbine section of the power conversion system is replaced with the S-CO2 Brayton cycle. The second concept is that the whole steam based power conversion system is replaced with the S-CO2 Brayton cycle. Several S -CO2 cycle options were considered in terms of power production and the desalination capacity and conducted a comparative analysis of selected layouts and the optimal operating conditions of the suggested layouts were identified.

"This paper presents the design and evaluation of a Web-based collaborative learning environment called EduCo for learning and practicing team-based exercises in computer science and software engineering courses. EduCo's defining characteristic is integrating a number of services for software development activities, for example, project management, requirements engineering, design, and programming into integrated shared workspaces with social-networking facilities to enhance collaboration among students and instructors. We conducted a controlled experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of the system in doing a three-iteration programming project. A total of 126 second-year students who attended an object-oriented programming course participated in the experiment. The results show that while the system was not found to affect student programming performance, it improved student engagement and satisfaction when working in teams. These results imply that the system's shared workspaces and social-networking services have the potential to enhance learning outcomes of students working in teams when these features are integrated into collaborative learning environments.

"The current study utilized longitudinal, self-report data from a sample of 109 dual-earner, working-class couples and their 6-year-old children living in the northeastern United States. Research questions addressed the roles of parents' gender ideology and gendered behaviors in predicting children's development of gender-role attitudes. It was hypothesized that parents' behavior would be more influential than their ideology in the development of their children's attitudes about gender roles. Parents responded to questionnaires assessing their global beliefs about women's and men's ""rightful"" roles in society, work preferences for mothers, division of household and childcare tasks, division of paid work hours, and job traditionality. These data were collected at multiple time points across the first year of parenthood, and during a 6-year follow-up. At the final time point, children completed the Sex Roles Learning Inventory (SERLI), an interactive measure that assesses gender-role attitudes. Overall, mothers' and fathers' behaviors were better predictors of children's gender-role attitudes than parents' ideology. In addition, mothers and fathers played unique roles in their sons' and daughters' acquisition of knowledge about gender stereotypes. Findings from the current study fill gaps in the literature on children's gender development in the family context-particularly by examining the understudied role of fathers in children's acquisition of knowledge regarding gender stereotypes and through its longitudinal exploration of the relationship between parents' gender ideologies, parents' gendered behaviors, and children's gender-role attitudes.",77
"Background: The P300 is a major index used to evaluate improvements in brain function. Although a few studies have reported evaluating the effectiveness of manual acupuncture or electro-acupuncture by monitoring the P300, research in this field is not yet very active. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of periodic low-frequency electrical stimulation applied to BL62 and KI6 on brain activity by analyzing the P300. Method: The study was conducted as a randomized double-blind test of 55 subjects in their 50s, including 26 males and 29 females. Each subject received 12 sessions of stimulation over a one-month period. In each session, low-frequency electrical stimulation at an average of 24 mu A and 2 Hz was applied to the acupuncture points BL62 and KI6, and event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured before the first session and after the last session of the electrical stimulation. Results: The results of a chi-square test indicated that the double-blind test was conducted correctly. Compared to the Sham group, all the subjects in the Real stimulation group showed a tendency toward a decreasing P300 latency and increasing P300 amplitude after all 12 sessions of stimulation. In the women, the amplitude significantly increased at Fz, Fcz, Cz, Cpz, and Pz. Conclusions: With this experiment, the low-frequency electrical stimulation of two acupuncture points (BL62 and K16) was confirmed to have a positive influence on the prevention of natural cerebral aging.",72
"This paper presents the results of centrifuge tests performed to investigate the behavior of geotextile-reinforced soil walls beyond stress conditions. The models were built using nonwoven fabrics as reinforcement layers and dry sand as backfill. Digital image analysis techniques were used to determine the displacement of sand markers placed along the reinforcements. The models were loaded until failure by increasing centrifugal acceleration, and the movements of the sand markers were used to determine the strain distributions along the reinforcement layers. The results revealed that stresses redistribute among reinforcement layers as models approach failure. Current design methods for GRS walls were found to be conservative when applied to predict the behavior of the reduced-scale models.",93
"Proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) C-terminal fragments (CTFs) by gamma-secretase underlies the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). An RNA interference screen using APP-CTF [99-residue CTF (C99)]- and Notch-specific gamma-secretase interaction assays identified a unique ErbB2-centered signaling network that was predicted to preferentially govern the proteostasis of APP-C99. Consistently, significantly elevated levels of ErbB2 were confirmed in the hippocampus of human AD brains. We then found that ErbB2 effectively suppressed autophagic flux by physically dissociating Beclin-1 from the Vps34-Vps15 complex independent of its kinase activity. Down-regulation of ErbB2 by CL-387,785 decreased the levels of C99 and secreted amyloid-beta in cellular, zebrafish, and mouse models of AD, through the activation of autophagy. Oral administration of an ErbB2-targeted CL-387,785 for 3 wk significantly improves the cognitive functions of APP/presenilin-1 (PS1) transgenic mice. This work unveils a noncanonical function of ErbB2 in modulating autophagy and establishes ErbB2 as a therapeutic target for AD.",106
"Purpose: To evaluate a health systems intervention to increase adolescents' receipt of high-quality sexual and reproductive health care services. Methods: Quasi experimental design. Twelve high schools in a large public school district were matched into pairs. Within each pair, schools were assigned to condition so that no control school shared a geographic border with an intervention school. Five yearly surveys (T1, T2,., T5) were administered from 2005 to 2009 (N = 29,823) to students in randomly selected classes in grades 9-12. Community-based providers of high-quality sexual and reproductive health care services were listed on a referral guide for use by school nurses to connect adolescents to care. Results: Statistically significant effects were found for intervention school females on three outcomes, relative to controls. Relative to T1, receipt of birth control in the past year was greater at T4 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-3.15) and T5 (AOR = 2.22; 95% CI, 1.32-3.74). Increases in sexually transmitted disease testing and/or treatment in the past year were greater in T1-T3 (AOR = 1.78; 95% CI, 1.05-3.02), T1-T4 (AOR = 1.73; 95% CI, 1.01-2.97), T1-T5 (AOR = 1.97; 95% CI, 1.17-3.31), and T2-T5 (AOR = 1.76; 95% CI, 1.06-2.91). Increases in ever receiving an HIV test were greater in T1-T4 (AOR = 2.14; 95% CI, 1.08-4.26). Among males, no intervention effects were found. Conclusions: A school-based structural intervention can improve female adolescents' receipt of services. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.",116
"In digitally controlled circuits for power electronic circuits, sampling data are important because the digital control circuit is operated on the basis of these data. If the sampled values have been affected by switching noise from the power circuit, the control stability of the circuit would be disturbed. This paper proposes a noiseless sampling method that can sample a value without being affected by the switching noise. The synchronous sampling method may be affected by the switching noise depending on the duty ratio of the circuit. The noiseless sampling method does not obtain data immediately after turn-on and turn-off switching. The control circuit can avoid the switching noise by using noiseless sampling, which leads to a disturbance in the control circuit and enhances the robustness of the circuit when applying the multisampling method. Experimental results are presented to verify that the current control of the proposed sampling method is not disturbed by the switching noise even in the absence of a noise filter.",48
"This article reports on the development of two courses designed for students in higher education game development programs during the period of 2006 to 2015. The students are from three different arts and design-related strands of the program, and had in common that very few had taken advanced science classes as part of their upper-secondary education. This meant that they were rather poorly equipped to learn programming, mathematics and physics, which they needed to master in order to understand the basics of game development. Consequently, the courses was designed in a way that allowed the students to practically engage in creating a computer games alongside being taught the actual science they needed in order to efficiently utilize those skills. A working hypothesis for the project was that if the responsible teachers were able to run the course in a way that cohered with the principles of problem-based learning, this would create an environment which would enhance the students' motivation to learn basic science as well as the operative and innovation skills needed for fulfilling the course requirements. In addition, ideas developed within the field of situated and experiential learning constituted theoretical points of departure for developing the course. The article describes the practical and theoretical points of departure for developing the courses and reflects on the experiences made from running it. Summing up, the authors conclude that the why and how of teaching needs to be in line with students' worlds in order for educational experiences to be considered as meaningful.",40
"Since XML could benefit greatly from database support and more specifically from relational database systems, we study the methodology of modeling fuzzy spatiotemporal data in XML and transforming fuzzy spatiotemporal data from XML to relational databases as well. To accomplish this, we devise a fuzzy spatiotemporal data model in XML to capture the semantics of fuzzy spatiotemporal features. To allow for better and platform independent sharing of fuzzy spatiotemporal data stored in a relational format, we propose a temporal edge approach to transform fuzzy spatiotemporal XML data into relational databases. The unique feature of our approach is that no schema information is required for transformation of fuzzy spatiotemporal data. Moreover, temporal, spatial, and fuzzy features of fuzzy spatiotemporal data in XML documents are taken into consideration. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate the performance advantages of our approach. Such approach of transformation could provide a significant consolidation of the interoperability of fuzzy spatiotemporal data from XML to relational databases.",112
"The present study was undertaken to investigate the influence of apneas on REM-elicited dream reports, and to examine the influence of clinically successful treatment of the apneas on dreaming. Thirty-three volunteers suffering from sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) slept during two nights in the sleep laboratory. Sixteen were treated with nasal continuous positive air pressure (CPAP) during the first night and 17 during the second. There was a total of 150 awakenings. 78 from REM sleep without apneas, and 72 from REM sleep with apneas. After apneas, dream recall tended to be higher (60% vs. 72%, p = 0.09) and dream reports were significantly longer (16 words vs. 24 words, p = 0.05), than after healthy sleep. No systematic incorporation of the apnea stimulus into the dream reports could be demonstrated. Dreams after apneas were found to be significantly more negative than dreams after healthy sleep (p < 0.01). This suggests that REM-elicited dreams are basically resistant to powerful internal stimulation. The stress caused by the apneas exerted only a very global emotional influence on manifest dreaming.",128
"The purpose of this longitudinal study was to investigate whether there are distinct etiological processes explaining dual usage of alcohol and conventional cigarettes by mothers from preconception through the early parenting years. Data on 8800 biological mothers were drawn from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), representative of US births in 2001. A general growth mixture model (GGMM) was used to empirically identify developmental trajectories of maternal smoking and drinking over the 5-6-year study period. Six classes defined by alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking were identified. These included a nonsmoking, low probability of drinking class (41%), and two drinking classes displaying no smoking with either moderate (26%) or escalating high (8%) probability drinking. Additionally, two predominantly smoking classes were identified, one displaying temporary reduction in smoking during pregnancy and low probability of drinking (11%) and one following a trajectory of persistent heavy smoking with a declining probability of drinking (9%). The sixth class was described by temporary reduction in smoking during pregnancy with high probability of drinking (6%). Covariates differentially predicted class membership, e.g., having a high school degree but not further education predicted concurrent drinking and smoking, and breastfeeding for more than 6 months is protective against concurrent use. Prior to conception, during prenatal care, and in post-natal clinical visits, whether for personal or pediatric care, screening women of reproductive age via characteristics that predict heterogeneity in smoking and drinking trajectories may help guide prevention and treatment options.",18
"Construction is one of the most hazardous industries due to its dynamic, temporary, and decentralized nature. The Hong Kong Commissioner for Labor identifies worker behavior as the root cause of construction accidents. Behavior-based safety (BBS) is one effective approach in managing employee safety issues. However, there is little research on the application of BBS in the construction industry. This research proposes an extension of the BBS approach, proactive behavior-based safety (PBBS), to improve construction safety. PBBS integrates the theory of BBS with the technology of Proactive Construction Management System (PCMS). The innovations of PBBS are: (1) automatically monitoring location-based behaviors; (2) quantitatively measuring safety performance; (3) investigating potential causes of unsafe behaviors; and (4) improving the efficiency of safety management. A pilot study of a Hong Kong construction site practicing PBBS was conducted. The experiment results showed that PBBS performed well on construction accident prevention and the Safety Index (SI) of the two project teams, with increased improvements by 36.07% and 44.70% respectively. It is concluded that PBBS is effective and adaptable to construction industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",102
"The Red Cell Special Interest Group (SIG) meeting, hosted by the British Blood Transfusion Society, provides an annual forum for the presentation of UK- and European-based red cell research. The 2015 meeting was held on Friday 30 October at the National Health Service Blood & Transplant (NHSBT) facility in Filton, Bristol and provided an exciting and varied programme on the themes of erythropoiesis, malaria biology and pathophysiology and red cells properties in stress and disease. Ten speakers presented on these topics over the course of one day. The meeting was well attended by over 90 delegates. Posters were presented during the lunch break, and abstracts from the posters are published at the end of this issue.",31
"Racial resentment has been shown to have a significant impact on voting by whites in recent presidential elections, and a much larger impact than the traditional gender-gap measure based on the male-female dichotomy. This analysis will use data from the American National Election Studies [ANES] to compare broader indicators of race and gender applicable to the Democratic and Republican parties as well as to respondents' opinions of appropriate roles for women. Since the 1980s the parties have diverged considerably on abortion and women's issues, and voters now view the Democrats as more supportive than Republicans of equality for women and reproductive rights. Perceptions of party differences on women's issues strongly influenced vote choice, 1988-2008, and in 2008 had greater impact on whites' votes than opinions on aid to blacks, abortion, gay marriage, or the economy. Although racial resentment was a strong predictor of the white vote in 2012 as in previous years, presidential voting was also significantly influenced by respondent sex as well as opinions on gender roles. Voters regarded the Democratic Party as ""better for the interests of women,"" and this proved to be a highly effective wedge issue for the Democrats in 2012.",77
"A wealth of observational studies show that low testosterone is associated with insulin resistance and with an increased risk of diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Experimental studies have identified potential mechanisms by which low testosterone may lead to insulin resistance. Visceral adipose tissue is an important intermediate in this relationship. Actions of testosterone or its metabolite oestradiol on other tissues such as muscle, liver, bone or the brain, and body composition-independent effects may also play a role. However, definitive evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to clarify whether the association of low testosterone with disordered glucose metabolism is causative is currently lacking. It therefore remains possible that this association is due to reverse causation, or simply originates by association with common health and lifestyle factors. RCTs of testosterone therapy in men with or without diabetes consistently show modest metabolically favourable changes in body composition. Despite this, testosterone effects on glucose metabolism have been inconsistent. Recent evidence suggests that the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis suppression in the majority of obese men with metabolic disorders is functional, and may be, at least in part, reversible with weight loss. Until further evidence is available, lifestyle measures with emphasis on weight reduction, treatment of comorbidities and optimisation of diabetic control should remain the first-line treatment in these men. Such measures, if successful, may be sufficient to normalise testosterone levels in men with metabolic disorders, who typically have only modest reductions in circulating testosterone levels.",6
"The constant 'interchain pressure' idea has been addressed, to evaluate if it is an adequate quantitative assumption to describe the fluid mechanics of oligomer diluted entangled NMMD polymer systems. The molecular stress function constitutive framework has been used with the constant interchain pressure assumption. Furthermore, the maximal extensibility based on the number of Kuhn steps in an entanglement has been used based on the relative Pad, inverse Langevin function. The model predictions agree with the extensional measurements on all previously published poly(methyl methacrylate)s and almost all published oligomer diluted NMMD polystyrenes. The only deviation is on the most diluted and largest molecular weight case of an 18% 1880 kg/mol polystyrene in oligomer diluent. In this case, the maximal extensibility is not needed.",86
"Episodic memory involves flexible retrieval processes that allow us to link together distinct episodes, make novel inferences across overlapping events, and recombine elements of past experiences when imagining future events. However, the same flexible retrieval and recombination processes that underpin these adaptive functions may also leave memory prone to error or distortion, such as source misattributions in which details of one event are mistakenly attributed to another related event. To determine whether the same recombination-related retrieval mechanism supports both successful inference and source memory errors, we developed a modified version of an associative inference paradigm in which participants encoded everyday scenes comprised of people, objects, and other contextual details. These scenes contained overlapping elements (AB, BC) that could later be linked to support novel inferential retrieval regarding elements that had not appeared together previously (AC). Our critical experimental manipulation concerned whether contextual details were probed before or after the associative inference test, thereby allowing us to assess whether (a) false memories increased for successful versus unsuccessful inferences, and (b) any such effects were specific to after compared with before participants received the inference test. In each of 4 experiments that used variants of this paradigm, participants were more susceptible to false memories for contextual details after successful than unsuccessful inferential retrieval, but only when contextual details were probed after the associative inference test. These results suggest that the retrieval-mediated recombination mechanism that underlies associative inference also contributes to source misattributions that result from combining elements of distinct episodes.",78
"Infrahumanisation studies have shown that people use the ability to experience secondary emotions, compared to primary emotions, as a characteristic that discriminates outgroups. This result has been widely supported in an extensive range of research work. However, we still do not know if under certain conditions this tendency is mitigated. The aim of this study is twofold. On the one hand, to determine whether a solidarity intergroup context results in a more human representation of outgroups, and on the other hand to verify if infrahumanisation bias is mitigated. For this purpose, three vignettes were elaborated. The first included a description of an outgroup, the German people, emphasising their laboriousness and charm. The second described them taking in refugees from the Balkan War. Finally, a text dealing with solidarity in general, without specific reference to the German people, was presented. In a two-step experimental design, first participants had to attribute secondary and primary emotions to the outgroup, and then answer a lexical decision task that registered the strength of association of secondary emotions with the ingroup and outgroup. The results show that the vignettes of intergroup solidarity contribute to humanising the representation of the outgroup and to reduce infrahumanisation bias.",63
"This paper presents an electronically tunable versatile multifunction voltage-mode biquadratic filter with three inputs and five outputs employing five operational transconductance amplifiers, two grounded capacitors and one grounded resistor. The use of grounded capacitors makes the circuit highly suitable for integrated circuit implementation. The proposed filter can simultaneously realize low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, band-stop and all-pass voltage responses by appropriately connecting the input and output terminals. The natural frequency and the quality factor can be orthogonally controlled. No inverting-type input signals are required for realizing all the filter responses, and all the incremental sensitivities are low. PSPICE simulation results are given to confirm the presented theory.",52
"BACKGROUND. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) are lipid mediators that bind to G-protein-coupled receptors. In this study, signaling responses to 18:1 LPA and S1P were examined in parallel in three human prostate cancer cell lines: PC-3, Du145, and LNCaP. METHODS. Receptor expression was assessed by RT-PCR, Northern blotting, and immunoblotting. Cellular responses to mediators were studied by proliferation assays, phosphoprotein immunoblotting, and phospholipid metabolism assays. RESULTS. All cell lines express mRNA for both LPA and S1P receptors. PC-3 and Du145, but not LNCaP, proliferate in response to LPA and S1P. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), LPA, and S1P induce activation of Erks in PC-3 and Du145; only EGF and PMA activate Erks in LNCaP. In Du145 and PC-3, Akt is activated by EGF, LPA, and S1P. Akt is constitutively active in LNCaP; EGF but not LPA or S1P stimulates further phosphorylation. FAK is phosphorylated in response to both LPA and S1P in PC-3 and Du145, but not in LNCaP. LPA and S1P stimulate phospholipase D (PLD) activity to varying extents in the different cell lines. Notably, both lipid mediators activate PLD in LNCaP. In Du145, LPA, but not S1P, activates PLD and enhances cellular production of LPA. CONCLUSIONS. Although both LPA and S1P induce signal transduction in all prostate cancer cell lines studied, a proliferation response is observed only when the Erk, Akt, and FAK pathways are activated. Other responses to the lipid mediators, such as PLD activation, likely contribute to other cellular outcomes. Prostate 69: 1493-1506, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",38
"A cell is a highly organized, dynamic, and intricate biological entity orchestrated by a myriad of proteins and their self-assemblies. Because a protein's actions depend on its coordination in both space and time, our curiosity about protein functions has extended from the test tube into the intracellular space of the cell. Accordingly, modern technological developments and advances in enzymology have been geared towards analyzing protein functions within intact single cells. We discuss here how fluorescence single-cell microscopy has been employed to identify subcellular locations of proteins, detect reversible protein-protein interactions, and measure protein activity and kinetics in living cells. Considering that fluorescence single-cell microscopy has been only recently recognized as a primary technique in enzymology, its potentials and outcomes in studying intracellular protein functions are projected to be immensely useful and enlightening. We anticipate that this review would inspire many investigators to study their proteins of interest beyond the conventional boundary of specific disciplines.

"Objectives: Evidence supports that girls are less proficient than boys at performing ball skills. This study examined the immediate and long-term effects of a ball skill intervention on preschool-age girls' ball skill performance. Design: Randomized controlled trial. Methods: Girls (M-age = 47.24 +/- 7.38 months) were randomly assigned to a high autonomy, mastery-based 9-week motor skill intervention (the Children's Health Activity Motor Program; CHAMP, 540 min; n =38) or a control group (free-play; n =16). Ball skill proficiency was assessed at pretest, posttest, and retention test (after 9 weeks) using the object control subscale of the Test of Gross Motor Development-2nd Edition. Treatment efficacy was examined using linear mixed models. Two models were fit: one for short-term changes (pretest to posttest) and one for long-term changes (pretest to retention). Results: Linear mixed models revealed a significantly time*treatment interaction for both models. Post hoc analysis confirmed that girls in CHAMP experienced significant gains in ball skills from pretest to posttest (p < .001) and pretest to retention (p.05) but had significantly higher ball skills scores at both posttest (p < .001) and retention (p < .001). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the positive effects of a ball skill intervention (i.e., CHAMP) on improving girls' ball skills both short- and long-term. Findings suggest that early childhood interventions that focus on the development of ball skills in young girls might be an avenue to improve girls' ball skill performance.

"To create possibilities for a more sustainable wastewater management, a novel system consisting of electrodeionization (EDI) and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is proposed in this study. This system is integrated with anaerobic digestion/landfills to capture energy from carbonaceous and nitrogenous pollutants. Both EDI and SOFCs showed good performances. EDI removed 95% and 76% ammonium-nitrogen (NH4+-N) from diluted (0.025 M) to concentrated (0.5 M) synthetic ammonium wastewaters, respectively, accompanied by hydrogen production. SOFCs converted the recovered fuels, biogas mixtures of methane and carbon dioxide, to electricity. Under the optimal conditions of EDI (3.0 V applied voltage and 7.5 mm internal electrode distance (IED), and SOFCs (750 degrees C operating temperature), the system achieved 60% higher net energy output as compared to conventional systems. The estimated energy benefit of this proposed system showed that the net energy balance ratio is enhanced from 1.11 (existing system) to 1.75 (this study) for a local Hong Kong active landfill facility with 10.0 g L-1 chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 0.21 M NH4+-N. Additionally, an average of 80% inorganic ions (heavy metals and nutrient elements) can be removed from the raw landfill leachate by EDI cell. The results are successful demonstrations of the upgrades of anaerobic processes for energy extraction from wastewater streams. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",43
"In the present work, hydrodynamics and mass-transfer performance of vapor-liquid flow of orthogonal wave tray (OWT) column was studied. Dry pressure drop, operating range (capacity graph) and overall column efficiency of OWT column were investigated using pilot columns. A three-dimensional CFD model was developed within the two-phase Eulerian framework to have an insight into the two-phase flow and mass-transfer behavior of OWT. The simulated results were compared with experimental data and showed a good agreement. Hydrodynamic and mass-transfer behaviors were revealed with the aid of velocity profiles, streamlines, interfacial area density distribution and so on. The effects of vapor/liquid load (F-s factor) on the Murphree tray efficiency were also studied. The simulations of OWT with different waves showed that the pressure drop, clear liquid height, froth height and Murphree tray efficiency increase with the increase of slope, and OWT with middle slope tended to have more uniform foam layer. Comparison of the liquid-phase component velocity between OWT and ripple shows that OWT has better performance in froth layer distribution and stability. The mass-transfer data showed that OWT not only had almost the same ""peak efficiency"" as sieve tray, but also had higher capacity and stability, it was suitable for capacity expansion.

"Background/Aims: Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis and suggested as a downstream mediator of the fibrogenic master cytokine TGF-beta. Methods: We investigated the effect of TGF-beta 1 on CTGF/CCN2 expression in cultured rat hepatic stellate cells and hepatocytes by means of Western and Northern blotting, immunocytochemistry, reporter gene analysis, and metabolic labelling. Results: We found that the expression of CTGF/CCN2 in hepatic stellate cells is (i) only marginally (if at all) stimulated by TGF-beta and by a constitutively active type I TGF-beta receptor, (ii) independent from Smad2/3 phosphorylation, (iii) not reduced by TGF-beta 1 antagonists or ALK5-receptor inhibitors and (iv) not upregulated during transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts in culture. However, expression and secretion of CTGF/CCN2 in cultured hepatocytes increased spontaneously during culture and was strongly stimulated by TGF-beta 1. In bile-duct ligated and CCl4-treated rat livers, a strong CTGF/ CCN2 expression in hepatocytes was noticed. Endothelin-1 stimulated CTGF/CCN2 expression in stellate cells but not in hepatocytes. Pathway specific signalling inhibitors point to the involvement of non-Smad signalling cascades but their contribution to CTGF/CCN2 regulation is different in both cell types. Conclusions: The results do not reveal a relevant interrelation between TGF-beta function and CTGF/CCN2 expression in hepatic stellate cells, which is in contrast to hepatocytes.

"A heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system is a multi-variable strongly coupled large-scale system that is composed of several sub-systems. Considerable research, simulations, and experiments have been conducted on HVAC control. The optimization control of an HVAC system is now the popular issue. The ultimate goal of this paper was to achieve minimum energy consumption and improve system efficiency. Multi-zone variable air volume and variable water volume air-conditioning systems were developed. The dynamic models of HVAC sub-systems were built by the adaptive directional forgetting method. Control strategies such as the gearshift integral proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller and self-tuning PID controller were studied in the platform to improve the dynamic characteristics of the HVAC system. System performance was improved. The system saved 18.2% of energy with the integration of iterative learning control and sequential quadratic programming based on the steady-state hierarchical optimization control scheme.",59
"In recent years, more scholarly attention has been paid to a growing range of geographic characteristics as antecedents of inequalities in women's health and well-being. The purpose of this study was to evaluate differences in health-related quality of life between rural and urban Polish postmenopausal women. Using a data set from a reproductive health preventive screening of 660 postmenopausal women aged 48-60 years, inhabitants of Wielkopolska and Lublin provinces, the association of place of residence, socioeconomic status and lifestyle factors with health-related quality of life (the SF-36 instrument) was evaluated using ANCOVA models and multiple logistic regression analysis with backward elimination steps. A consistent rural-to-urban gradient was found in all indices of physical health functioning and well-being but not in vitality, social functioning, emotional role and mental health scales with women in large cities being likely to enjoy the highest and those in villages the lowest quality of life. The rural urban disparities in health-related quality of life were mediated by women's socioeconomic status. The likelihood of worse physical and mental functioning and well-being was 2-3 times greater for the low socioeconomic status rural women than their counterparts from more affluent urban areas. The educational attainment and employment status were the most powerful independent risk factors for health-related quality of life in both rural and urban women. Better understanding of the role of socioeconomic status that acts as a mediator in the association between area of residence and health-related quality of life may be useful in developing public health policies on health inequalities among women at midlife.

"For oblique arch, curved beam, space oblique composite system of suspension bridge, whose force transmission path and spatial stress is complex, robustness characteristics is strong, and no engineering experience can be used for reference. In order to analyse wind resistant performance of the Tongtai bridge, the aeroelastic model of the bridge is designed and fabricated by accurately simulating the flow field in the boundary layer of the field and using wind tunnel test technique, calculated vortex vibration, buffeting and aerodynamic stability of the arch-rib and whole bridge under uniform flow field and turbulent flow field at different attack angle, angle condition. The experimental results show that the bridge has good aerodynamic stability and no obvious vortex vibration occurs. The vertical and lateral displacement of the arch rib 1/4 section is higher than that of the crown, but it meets the requirement of wind resistance.",97
"Lectin is regarded as a potential molecule involved in immune recognition and phagocytosis through opsonization in crustacean. Knowledge on lectin at molecular level would help us to understand its regulation mechanism in crustacean immune system. A novel C-type lectin gene (Fclectin) was cloned from hemocytes of Chinese shrimp Fenneropenaeus chinensis by 3' and 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) PCR. The full-length cDNA consists of 1482 bp with an 861 bp open reading frame, encoding 287 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence contains a putative signal peptide of 19 amino acids. It also contains two carbohydrate recognition domains/C-type lectin-like domains (CRD1 and CRD2), which share 78% identity with each other. CRD1 and CRD2 showed 34% and 30% identity with that of mannose-binding lectin from Japanese lamprey (Lethenteron japonicum), respectively. Both CRD1 and CRD2 of Fclectin have I I amino acids residues, which are relatively invariant in animals' C-type lectin CRDs. Five residues at Ca2+ binding site I are conserved in Fclectin. The potential Ca2+/carbohydrate-binding (site 2) motif QPD, E, NP (Gln-Pro-Asp, Glu, Asn-Pro) presented in the two CRDs of Fclectin may support its ability to bind galactose-type sugars. It could be deduced that Fclectin is a member of C-type lectin superfamily. Transcripts of Fclectin were found only in hemocytes by Northern blotting and RNA in situ hybridization. The variation of mRNA transcription level in hemocytes during artificial infection with bacteria and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) was quantitated by capillary electrophoresis after RT-PCR. An exploration of mRNA expression variation after LPS stimulation was carried out in primarily cultured hemocytes in vitro. Expression profiles of Fclectin gene were greatly modified after bacteria, LPS or WSSV challenge. The above-stated data can provide us clues to understand the probable role of C-type lectin in innate immunity of shrimp and would be helpful to shrimp disease control. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

"Besides genetic abnormalities in MPN patients, several studies have reported alterations in protein expression that could contribute towards the clinical phenotype. However, little is known about protein modifications in Ph- MPN erythrocytes. In this context, we used a quantitative mass spectrometry proteomics approach to study the MPN erythrocyte proteome. LC-MS/MS (LTQ Orbitrap) analysis led to the identification of 51 and 86 overexpressed proteins in Polycythemia Vera and Essential Thrombocythemia respectively, compared with controls. Functional comparison using pathway analysis software showed that the Rho GTPase family signaling pathways were deregulated in MPN patients. In particular, IQGAP1 was significantly overexpressed in MPNs compared with controls. Additionally, Western-blot analysis not only confirmed IQGAP1 overexpression, but also showed that IQGAP1 levels depended on the patient's genotype. Moreover, we found that in JAK2V617F patients IQGAP1 could bind RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 and consequently recruit activated GTP-Rac1 and the cytoskeleton motility protein PAK1. In CALR( +) patients, IQGAP1 was not overexpressed but immunoprecipitated with RhoGDI. In JAK2V617F transduced Ba/F3 cells we confirmed JAK2 inhibitor-sensitive overexpression of IQGAP1/PAK1. Altogether, our data demonstrated alterations of IQGAP1/Rho GTPase signaling in MPN erythrocytes dependent on JAIC2/CALR status, reinforcing the hypothesis that modifications in erythrocyte signaling pathways participate in Ph- MPN pathogenesis.

"Objective: The objective of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound on the resorption activity of osteoclast cell cultures. Design: RAW 264.7 cells were cultured and seeded over plates that were pre-coated with a synthetic carbonate apatite, and marked with fluoresceinamine-labeled sodium chondroitin polysulfate. Plates were randomly divided into 4 groups according to the treatment assigned to each one of them: NO RANKL (no RANK-L addition and no ultrasound application), NO LIPUS (addition of RANK-L and no ultrasound application), LIPUS 10 (addition of RANK-L and 10 min of ultrasound application per day), and LIPUS 20 (addition of RANK-L and 20 min of ultrasound application per day). The ultrasound device produced 1.5 MHz pulses with a repetition rate of 1 kHz and intensity of 30 mW/cm(2). The experiment extended for one week and afterwards, resorption activity was evaluated according to the fluorescence intensity analysis and pit resorption measurements (number of pits and mean area). Results: Our experiment consistently demonstrated that low-intensity pulsed ultrasound application enhanced osteoclasts resorptive activity. In addition, it was demonstrated that when daily ultrasound application lasted longer (20 min) the resorption was the highest. Results obtained from both evaluation methods were reasonably coherent. Conclusions: Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound increases osteoclast resorptive activity in the absence of osteoblasts. This effect seems to be influenced by ultrasound treatment time. Future research might be directed to investigate osteoclast response to different ultrasound application protocols (frequencies and intensities) and potential cellular mechanisms.

"This article features an authentic research-lab experience developed for use in a freshman-level general biology course for nonmajors at a two-year college. Students work in groups to select and investigate factors affecting microalgal cell growth and relate their findings to a real-life application of social significance. This lab experience was designed using a four-step pedagogical framework originally developed at a four-year university in a sophomore-level molecular and cell biology course. The creators of the pedagogical framework at the four-year university mentored the instructor at the two-year college through the process of using the pedagogical framework to design and implement the authentic research lab experience described in this article. This example shows that adaptation of successful pedagogical models, particularly within mentoring partnerships, can greatly increase the implementation of authentic research experiences in biology lab courses at varying levels of study.",31

"In most chronic inflammatory diseases, the cause remains unknown. Chronic infection is, however, among the current hypotheses. Recent technological advances have allowed in-depth studies of the gut microflora, or microbiota, which contains a vast array of organisms, most of which cannot be cultured. Inflammatory bowel disease has been associated with distinctive changes in the gut microbiota, which persist between disease flares and may play a pathogenic role. Links have been demonstrated between the gut microbiota and joint inflammation in murine models of arthritis but have received little attention in human patients. Recent work has nevertheless demonstrated substantial alterations in the gut microbiota in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or spondyloarthritis, with differences across diagnoses and studies. Interestingly, some of these alterations resemble those now firmly established in inflammatory bowel disease; examples include decreased microbial diversity and lower frequencies of bacterial groups belonging to the Firmicutes phylum known to have immunoregulatory properties. These new findings open up important new horizons both for understanding disease and for developing novel biomarkers and treatment strategies. (C) 2016 Societe francaise de rhumatologie.

Results indicate that a single guided relaxation intervention improves positive affect among individuals high in stress reactivity.",29
"In the present article, we investigate the influence of sociocultural stereotypes on the impression formation of basketball players and coaches. In Experiment 1 (n=32), participants were shown a picture of a black or white basketball player prior to observation of a point-light video of a player executing a basketball free throw. The participant was informed that the player depicted in the picture was executing the free throw. Results indicated that ethnicity of the target player significantly influenced participant evaluations, demonstrating specific stereotypes about black and white basketball players when evaluating performance. In Experiment 2 (n=30), results derived from the Implicit Association Test indicated that black players are implicitly associated with athletic player attributes. The results are in line with social schema theory and demonstrate that - similar to findings that have been reported in the United States - a subpopulation of German basketball players and coaches hold specific stereotypes about the abilities of black and white basketball athletes. These stereotypes bias impression formation when coaches and players make assessments of basketball performance.",63
"Gait analysis using wearable wireless sensors can be an economical, convenient and effective way to provide diagnostic and clinical information for various health-related issues. In this work, our custom designed low-cost wireless gait analysis sensor that contains a basic inertial measurement unit (IMU) was used to collect the gait data for four patients diagnosed with balance disorders and additionally three normal subjects, each performing the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) tests while wearing the custom wireless gait analysis sensor (WGAS). The small WGAS includes a tri-axial accelerometer integrated circuit (IC), two gyroscopes ICs and a Texas Instruments (TI) MSP430 microcontroller and is worn by each subject at the T4 position during the DGI tests. The raw gait data are wirelessly transmitted from the WGAS to a near-by PC for real-time gait data collection and analysis. In order to perform successful classification of patients vs. normal subjects, we used several different classification algorithms, such as the back propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and binary decision trees (BDT), based on features extracted from the raw gait data of the gyroscopes and accelerometers. When the range was used as the input feature, the overall classification accuracy obtained is 100% with BP-ANN, 98% with SVM, 96% with KNN and 94% using BDT. Similar high classification accuracy results were also achieved when the standard deviation or other values were used as input features to these classifiers. These results show that gait data collected from our very low-cost wearable wireless gait sensor can effectively differentiate patients with balance disorders from normal subjects in real time using various classifiers, the success of which may eventually lead to accurate and objective diagnosis of abnormal human gaits and their underlying etiologies in the future, as more patient data are being collected.",51
"Objective The aim of the study was to estimate the burden and direct medical costs of unintended pregnancy to the public payer in Spain. Methods An economic model evaluating the costs and outcomes of contraceptive use over a 1-year period was constructed for women in Spain aged 15 to 44 years at risk of pregnancy. Model inputs were derived from published literature and national survey data. Outcomes evaluated included: (i) the annual number of unintended pregnancy events and their cost; (ii) the proportion of unintended pregnancy events and their cost due to non-adherence; and (iii) the use and cost of contraceptive methods in Spain. Results Of the total number of pregnancies, 35% are estimated to be unintended and are associated with a direct cost burden of (sic)292.8 million per year. Most unintended pregnancies (26%) occur in women aged 30 to 34 years, whilst 69% of the total cost burden is estimated to be attributable to poor adherence to contraceptive methods. Conclusions The cost associated with unintended pregnancy is high. The major proportion of the burden is estimated to be attributable to imperfect adherence and is likely avoidable. Shifts in patterns of contraceptive use, combined with measures to improve adherence, could have a substantial and positive impact on this burden.",124
"Background: Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections can be found throughout the body, especially in epithelial tissue. Animal model was established by inoculation of HCMV (strain AD-169) or coinoculation with Hepatitis E virus (HEV) into the ligated sacculus rotundus and vermiform appendix in living rabbits. The specimens were collected from animals sacrificed 1 and a half hours after infection. Results: The virus was found to be capable of reproducing in these specimens through RT-PCR and Western-blot. Severe inflammation damage was found in HCMV-infected tissue. The viral protein could be detected in high amounts in the mucosal epithelium and lamina propria by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescense. Moreover, there are strong positive signals in lymphocytes, macrophages, and lymphoid follicles. Quantitative statistics indicate that lymphocytes among epithlium cells increased significantly in viral infection groups. Conclusions: The results showed that HCMV or HEV + HCMV can efficiently infect in rabbits by vivo ligated intestine loop inoculation. The present study successfully developed an infective model in vivo rabbit ligated intestinal Loop for HCMV pathogenesis study. This rabbit model can be helpful for understanding modulation of the gut immune system with HCMV infection.",33
"Purpose: To examine the association between symptoms of depression and ambivalence about pregnancy in an inner-city adolescent female population. Methods: This study analyzed data from 220 urban minority adolescent females (ages, 15 -19 years) presenting for contraceptive initiation in a comprehensive, free-of-cost, adolescent health center in New York City. Cross-sectional baseline data were examined to define the relationship between participants' ambivalence toward pregnancy (defined by responses to items previously used in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health) and symptoms of depression (assessed by the Center for Epidemiological StudieseDepression scale). After controlling for covariates, multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the unique contribution of symptoms of depression on the pregnancy ambivalent group. Results: Over one third of adolescent females self-reported ambivalence about pregnancy (n = 73, 33%). In our sample, 20% (n = 45) reported mild and 14% (n = 30) reported moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression. After controlling for potentially confounding factors, adolescent females who reported mild symptoms of depression had increased odds of reporting pregnancy ambivalence (adjusted odds ratio, 3.53; confidence interval, 1.64-7.62; p = .001) compared with those with minimal symptoms of depression. Conclusions: A substantial number of adolescents, despite planning to initiate contraception, were ambivalent about pregnancy; those reporting ambivalence were more likely to report mild symptoms of depression. When counseling adolescents about contraception initiation, clinicians should be aware that mild symptoms of depression may contribute to ambivalence about pregnancy.

"This article proposes an automatic image processing method that can be an effective diagnostic tool to detect and grade the severity of diabetic retinopathy. This computer vision-based algorithm imitates the logic and medical sense used by ophthalmologist in detecting the abnormality and its location in the image for grading the severity of the disease. The detection is based on finding abnormalities, such as exudates and red lesions, and the grading is based on the location of these abnormalities in the image referred with its distance from the macula. Accordingly the entire image has been divided into regions and occurrence of abnormalities in these regions indicates the severity of the disease. The methodology stresses on two major factors, accuracy of the results and computation time. It is found that both these design parameters are nicely achieved in the proposed method. The experimental results indicate that overall accuracy over 90% can be achieved in the proposed method and also significantly reduce the computational complexity in this region-based approach.",0
"Objective. Conventional, multi-channel scalp electroencephalography (EEG) allows the identification of the attended speaker in concurrent-listening ('cocktail party') scenarios. This implies that EEG might provide valuable information to complement hearing aids with some form of EEG and to install a level of neuro-feedback. Approach. To investigate whether a listener's attentional focus can be detected from single-channel hearing-aid-compatible EEG configurations, we recorded EEG from three electrodes inside the ear canal ('in-Ear-EEG') and additionally from 64 electrodes on the scalp. In two different, concurrent listening tasks, participants (n = 7) were fitted with individualized in-Ear-EEG pieces and were either asked to attend to one of two dichotically-presented, concurrent tone streams or to one of two diotically-presented, concurrent audiobooks. A forward encoding model was trained to predict the EEG response at single EEG channels. Main results. Each individual participants' attentional focus could be detected from single-channel EEG response recorded from short-distance configurations consisting only of a single in-Ear-EEG electrode and an adjacent scalp-EEG electrode. The differences in neural responses to attended and ignored stimuli were consistent in morphology (i.e. polarity and latency of components) across subjects. Significance. In sum, our findings show that the EEG response from a single-channel, hearing-aid-compatible configuration provides valuable information to identify a listener's focus of attention.",80
"Aims and objectives To assess women's attitudes towards the mechanisms of action of birth control methods. BackgroundWhen addressing women's knowledge of and attitudes towards birth control methods, researchers frequently focus on side effects, effectiveness or correct use. Women's opinions about mechanisms of action have been much less investigated, and research is usually concentrated on the EC pill. DesignCross-sectional study. MethodsWomen, aged 18-49, from Germany, France, the UK, Sweden and Romania were randomly selected (n=1137). They were asked whether they would use a method that may work after fertilisation or after implantation and whether they would continue using it after learning it may have such effects. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the influence of certain characteristics on women's attitudes. ResultsAlmost half of women in Romania and Germany would not use methods with postfertilisation effects, while the lowest percentages were found in Sweden and in France. Regarding methods with postimplantation effects, higher percentages were found in all the countries. Highly educated women and those using a highly effective method were more likely to use methods with postfertilisation effects. On the contrary, married women, those who stated that human life begins at fertilisation and women with middle/high religiosity were less likely to consider using methods that may act after fertilisation. Conclusions One-third of European women reported that they would not consider using a method that may have postfertilisation effects. Relevance to clinical practice Given that postfertilisation effects may not be acceptable to some women, informing them of which methods may have these effects is essential to obtaining complete informed consent and to promoting women's autonomy.",124
"Accurate and timely information of construction project progress in a regular repeated basis is one of the critical stages of construction management. The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of field data capturing technologies (FDCT), in combination with building information modelling (BIM) on automated construction project progress monitoring (ACPPM). The research is based on a survey of contracting and engineering consulting firms operating in the Middle East, Mid-Asia, Europe, North America, and Far East. Based on an evaluation of the findings, 3D Laser Scanning (LS), Image-based, and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies in combination with BIM were found as the most used technologies for ACPPM. At the end, a conceptual framework is illustrated and managerial implications are highlighted with a sample statement focusing on requirements, processes and benefits. The study confirms the importance of using BIM-based FDCT in enhancing ACPPM factors performance. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",102
"Development of effective monitoring systems of power exchange fluctuations and proportional alignment of loading on gas-diesel-generator units requires carrying out detailed researches both their own fluctuations, and exchange fluctuations in case of parallel work of several units. Carrying out such researches on real objects is limited to their considerable cost and can be given only at the final stage. Therefore it is very important for developers to have adequate models of the studied objects. The researches of output voltage frequency fluctuations for real objects executed by authors showed that in general they have casual character, and these fluctuations in all range of loadings represent non-stationary casual process with the changing population mean and dispersion. Authors developed mathematical model of the regulator stabilizing exchange fluctuations of power in the studied system. But there was a question of its hardware realization because it requires solving the problem of identification of the structure of this system and on-line monitoring of changes in its parameters and signals. The authors have proposed a candidate solution for such a problem through the example of identification and synthesis of the system of measuring system performance indicators required to appraise the electric power quality in this system and, as consequence, performance quality.",48
"Background: Dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency is a combined immunodeficiency caused by autosomal recessive loss-of- function mutations in DOCK8. This disorder is characterized by recurrent cutaneous infections, increased serum IgE levels, and severe atopic disease, including food-induced anaphylaxis. However, the contribution of defects in CD4(+) T cells to disease pathogenesis in these patients has not been thoroughly investigated. Objective: We sought to investigate the phenotype and function of DOCK8-deficient CD4(+) T cells to determine (1) intrinsic and extrinsic CD4 1 T-cell defects and (2) how defects account for the clinical features of DOCK8 deficiency. Methods: We performed in-depth analysis of the CD4(+) T-cell compartment of DOCK8-deficient patients. We enumerated subsets of CD4(+) T helper cells and assessed cytokine production and transcription factor expression. Finally, we determined the levels of IgE specific for staple foods and house dust mite allergens in DOCK8-deficient patients and healthy control subjects. Results: DOCK8-deficient memory CD4 1 T cells were biased toward a T(H)2 type, and this was at the expense of T(H)1 and T(H)17 cells. In vitro polarization of DOCK8-deficient naive CD4(+) T cells revealed the TH2 bias and TH17 defect to be T-cell intrinsic. Examination of allergen-specific IgE revealed plasma IgE from DOCK8-deficient patients is directed against staple food antigens but not house dust mites. Conclusion: Investigations into the DOCK8-deficient CD4(+) T cells provided an explanation for some of the clinical features of this disorder: the T(H)2 bias is likely to contribute to atopic disease, whereas defects in T(H)1 and T(H)17 cells compromise antiviral and antifungal immunity, respectively, explaining the infectious susceptibility of DOCK8-deficient patients.",110
"Background and Aims: To investigate the efficacy and safety of three different dosages of embryonated, viable eggs of Trichuris suis [TSO] versus placebo for induction of remission in mildly-to-moderately active ileocolonic, uncomplicated Crohn's disease [CD]. Methods: Adults with active CD [n = 252] randomly received six fortnightly doses of 250, 2500, or 7500 TSO/15 ml suspension/day [TSO 250, TSO 2500, TSO 7500], or 15 ml placebo solution/day, in a double-blind fashion, with 4 weeks' follow-up. Primary endpoint was the rate of clinical remission [Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] < 150] at end of treatment, ie at Week 12 or withdrawal. Secondary endpoints included the course of clinical remission, rate of clinical response, change in CDAI, change in markers of inflammation, mucosal healing, and Physician's Global Assessment. Results: Clinical remission at Week 12 occurred in 38.5%, 35.2%, and 47.2% of TSO 250, TSO 2500, and TSO 7500 patients, respectively, and in 42.9% of placebo recipients. TSO induced a dose-dependent immunological response. There was no response regarding laboratory markers of inflammation. Other secondary efficacy variables also showed no advantage of TSO over placebo for treatment of active CD. Administration of TSO did not result in any serious adverse drug reaction. Review of non-serious suspected adverse drug reactions following TSO did not reveal any safety concerns. Conclusions: Administration of 250-7500 TSO fortnightly over 12 weeks was safe and showed a dose-dependent immunological response, but no TSO dose showed a clinically relevant effect over placebo for induction of clinical remission or response in mildly-to-moderately active, ileocolonic CD.",118
"ObjectiveCognitive remediation therapy (CRT) is a specialized treatment approach targeting cognitive weaknesses in anorexia nervosa (AN). Regarding follow-up effects of CRT, there are only few studies available; for adolescents, there are no data. MethodsForty-eight adolescents with AN were assigned to receive either CRT and treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU alone. Assessments were performed at baseline (n=48) and compared with assessments at a 6-month follow-up (n=33). Outcome measures were set-shifting, central coherence, eating disorder and general psychopathology. ResultsThe completion rate was higher in CRT compared with TAU. There were no significant differences in neuropsychological and clinical variables. Changes in body mass index percentile showed a trend towards significance for CRT. Dropout analyses revealed no significant predictors. ConclusionsResults provide a first insight into follow-up-assessments of CRT in adolescent AN. More randomized controlled studies are needed to clarify the long-term effects of CRT. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and Eating Disorders Association.",67
"Background Treatment with omalizumab has shown a positive effect on food allergies, but no dosages are established. Basophil allergen threshold sensitivity (CD-sens) can be used to objectively measure omalizumab treatment efficacy and correlates with the outcome of double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge to peanut. Objective To evaluate whether individualized omalizumab treatment monitored by CD-sens could be an effective intervention for suppression of allergic reactions to peanut. Methods Severely peanut allergic adolescents (n = 23) were treated with omalizumab for 8 weeks, and CD-sens was analysed before and after. Based on whether CD-sens was suppressed after 8 weeks, the patients either were subject to a peanut challenge or received eight more weeks with increased dose of omalizumab, followed by peanut challenge or another 8-week cycle of omalizumab. IgE and IgE-antibodies to peanut and its components were analysed before treatment. Results After individualized omalizumab treatment (8-24 weeks), all patients continued with an open peanut challenge with no (n = 18) or mild (n = 5) objective allergic symptoms. Patients (n = 15) needing an elevated omalizumab dose (ED) to suppress CD-sens had significantly higher CD-sens values at baseline 1.49 (0.44-20.5) compared to those (n = 8) who managed with normal dose (ND) 0.32 (0.24-5.5) (P < 0.01). Median ratios for Ara h 2 IgE-ab/IgE were significantly higher in the ED group (17%) compared to the ND group (11%). Conclusions and Clinical Relevance Individually dosed omalizumab, monitored by CD-sens, is an effective and safe treatment for severe peanut allergy. The ratio of IgE-ab to storage protein Ara h 2/IgE as well as CD-sens to peanut may predict the need of a higher omalizumab dose.",105
"Synthetic biology (or chemical biology) is a growing field to which the chemical synthesis of proteins, particularly enzymes, makes a fundamental contribution. However, the chemical synthesis of catalytically active proteins (enzymes) remains poorly documented because it is difficult to obtain enough material for biochemical experiments. We chose calstabin, a 107-amino-acid proline isomerase, as a model. We synthesized the enzyme using the native chemical ligation approach and obtained several tens of milligrams. The polypeptide was refolded properly, and we characterized its biophysical properties, measured its catalytic activity, and then crystallized it in order to obtain its tridimensional structure after X-ray diffraction. The refolded enzyme was compared to the recombinant, wild-type enzyme. In addition, as a first step of validating the whole process, we incorporated exotic amino acids into the N-terminus. Surprisingly, none of the changes altered the catalytic activities of the corresponding mutants. Using this body of techniques, avenues are now open to further obtain enzymes modified with exotic amino acids in a way that is only barely accessible by molecular biology, obtaining detailed information on the structure-function relationship of enzymes reachable by complete chemical synthesis.",30
"Purpose: Rural bypass of Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) for elective inpatient and outpatient surgical procedures has not been studied. Residents choosing to have their elective surgeries elsewhere, when the local CAH provides those surgical services, erode their rural hospital's financial base. The purpose of this research is to describe the elective surgical bypass rate, the procedures most commonly bypassed by rural residents, the distribution of volume among CAHs that offer elective surgical services, and factors predictive of bypass. Methods: A sample of elective surgery discharges was created from the 2011 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases and State Ambulatory Surgery Databases for Colorado, North Carolina, Vermont, and Wisconsin. Frequencies of procedures bypassed and CAH volume distribution were performed. Logistic regression was used to model factors associated with rural bypass for elective surgical care. Findings: The rural bypass rate for elective surgical procedures is 48.4%. Procedures bypassed most are operations on the musculoskeletal system, eye, and digestive system. Annual volume distribution for elective surgical procedures among CAHs varied widely. Patients who are younger, medically complex, at higher surgical risk, and have private insurance are at higher odds of bypass. Patients are also more likely to bypass low-volume hospitals. Conclusion: Rural hospitals should consider developing surgical services that are performed electively and on an outpatient basis that are attractive to a broader rural population. CAHs that already offer elective surgical procedures and yet who are still bypassed must examine the mutable factors that drive bypass behavior.",8
"Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is a zinc metalloprotease, known to degrade insulin peptide and amyloid-beta (A beta); the key protein involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Considering the important role played by IDE in disease progression of AD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), we endeavored to identify the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) IDE orthologous genes and test them for their role in AD related outcomes. We employed bioinformatics, reverse genetics and molecular biology approaches towards identification and functional characterization of putative IDE candidates in C. elegans. Using in-silico analysis we have identified seven C elegans genes that possess HXXEH motif, an identifying marker of IDE. We further carried out functional analysis of the identified genes in A beta expressing C elegans strain CL4176 [myo-3/A beta 1-42 long 3'-UTR] via studying effect on A beta induced toxicity, cholinergic neuroanatomy, content of acetylcholine/acetylcholine-esterase, extent of reactive oxygen species and expression of FOXO transcription factor DAF-16. Our findings reveal that amongst the identified putative IDE orthologs, a functionally uncharacterized gene C28F5.4 had a profound effect on the tested endpoints. Knocking down C28F5.4 modulated the AD associated conditions by decreasing A beta induced toxicity, severely compromising cholinergic neuroanatomy, reducing expression of acetylcholine-transporter, decreasing acetylcholine content, elevating ROS, with no effect on DAF-16 stress-response protein. These studies provide crucial insight into the structural/functional orthology of IDEs across human and nematode species and further our understanding of the involvement of these proteins and insulin pathway in AD. Further studies could aid in identifying novel drug-targets and in understanding the common modulating factors between AD and T2DM. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",30
"A recent study by Hassabis et al. suggests that the brain constructs 'personality models' of other people. When imagining another individual, multi-voxel patterns of fMRI activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) contained information about the individual's unique combination of personality traits. The authors propose that, in concert with other regions, the mPFC assembles a model of another's personality that is ultimately used to predict behavior.",63
"Over the past years software architecture has become an important sub-field of software engineering. There has been substantial advancement in developing new technical approaches to start handling architectural design as an engineering discipline. Measurement is an essential part of any engineering discipline. Quantifying the quality attributes of the software architecture will reveal good insights about the architecture. It will also help architects and practioners to choose the best fit of alternative architectures that meets their needs. This work paves the way for researchers to start investigating ways to measure software architecture quality attributes. Measurement of these qualities is essential for this sub-field of software engineering. This work explores Stability and Understandability of software architecture, several metrics that affect them, and literature review of these qualities.",123
"A Summary Twenty-five percent of patients with a non-hip non-vertebral fragility fracture have an undiagnosed vertebral fracture detected by vertebral fracture assessment during bone densitometric assessment. The prevalence of an undiagnosed vertebral fracture is higher in older people, and they are more likely to have multiple vertebral fractures. Purpose Most vertebral fragility fractures (VFF) have no history of trauma. Vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) during dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) can be used to detect these VFFs. This study aims to identify the prevalence of undiagnosed VFF in patients presenting with a non-hip non-vertebral fragility fracture. Methods Patients identified by the fracture liaison service (FLS) of a large UK university hospital presenting with a non-hip non-vertebral fragility fracture were evaluated from 1 January 2012 to 30 September 2015. Local protocol identified those that would proceed for VFA. Data was collected on patient characteristics, fracture details, bone mineral density (BMD) measurements and VFA results. Results Five hundred sixty-seven patients (mean (SD) age, 72 (9.4) years) of mostly women (88.3%) had a VFA performed as part of their DXA assessment. One hundred forty-three patients (25.2%) were identified to have a vertebral fracture, of whom 57.3% of them had one fracture. 49.5% of those with vertebral fractures had BMD measurements diagnostic of osteoporosis. Mean (SD) age was higher in those with vertebral fractures compared to those without; 74.9 (8.3) years vs 70.4 (9.5) years, p < 0.00. Those aged 75 years and over were more likely to have multiple fractures than those younger than 75 years (16.3 vs 4%, p = 0.01). Conclusion A quarter of patients presenting with a non-hip non-vertebral fragility fracture have an undiagnosed vertebral fracture. Older people are more likely to have vertebral fractures and more likely to have multiple fractures. VFA during bone densitometric assessment can further aid stratifying future fracture risk.",16
"A procedure aimed to support designers in achieving structural improvements to reduce the seismic vulnerability of an electrical network is presented. This method based on the use of ASK4ELP software (Assessment of Seismic Risk for Electric Power Grids) allows minimising the costs of the actions needed in order to reach the required level of reliability, as defined by two different indexes of damage, namely the loss of transmitted power and the number of customers excluded from the service. An updating plan for the reinforcement of a power transmission grid includes the identification of its critical nodes, of the electromechanical components to be strengthened and of the related reinforcement level. In this paper, it is shown how the vulnerability assessment carried out with ASK4ELP can help in finding the optimal solution to these tasks, increasing the effectiveness-to-costs ratio. Three different empirical criteria for the individuation of the critical nodes are evaluated and the simulation of a significant part of the Italian transmission grid is presented: the results suggest that the most effective criterion for individuating the grid critical nodes should be given in terms of their exclusion probability.",50
"In this study, we investigated whether minocycline, a second-generation tetracycline proposed as an add-on to antipsychotics in treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS), may affect the expression of Homer and Arc postsynaptic density (PSD) transcripts, implicated in synaptic regulation. Minocycline was administered alone or with haloperidol in rats exposed or not to ketamine, mimicking acute glutamatergic psychosis or naturalistic conditions, respectively. Arc expression was significantly reduced by minocycline compared with controls. Minocycline in combination with haloperidol also significantly reduced Arc expression compared with both controls and haloperidol alone. Moreover, haloperidol/minocycline combination significantly affected Arc expression in cortical regions, while haloperidol alone was ineffective on cortical gene expression. These results suggest that minocycline may strongly affect the expression of Arc as mediated by haloperidol, both in terms of quantitative levels and of topography of haloperidol-related expression. It is noteworthy that no significant pre-treatment effect was found, suggesting that pre-exposure to ketamine did not grossly affect gene expression. Minocycline was not found to significantly affect haloperidol-related Homer1a expression. No significant changes in Homer1b/c expression were observed. These results are consistent with previous observations that minocycline may modulate postsynaptic glutamatergic transmission, affecting distinct downstream pathways initiated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor modulation, i.e. Arc-mediated but not Homer1a-mediated pathways.",72
"In AC rail networks, the new locomotives using four-quadrant rectifiers are responsible for low frequency disturbances on overhead line voltage. In recent years, around the world, interactions between locomotives and power supply have been observed. In some sectors of the 25kV-50Hz French rail network, serious disturbances have affected the rail system operation while flicker was observed on the upstream electrical network. To prevent such dysfunctions, an analysis method is proposed. Any locomotive or multiple-unit train is characterized as an admittance matrix by using a Voltage Source Converter. After that, a stability study can be performed on each critical area with a view to determine the acceptable number of locomotives equipped with active front-end rectifiers.",50
"This paper proposes a general architecture for testing, validating and verifying Ambient Intelligence (AmI) environments: AmISim. The development of AmI is a very complex task because this technology must often adapt to contextual information as well as unpredictable behaviours and environmental features. The architecture presented deals with AmI applications in order to cover the different components of these kinds of systems: environment, users, context and adaptation. This architecture is the first one that is able to cover all these features, which are needed in a full AmI system. The paper shows that AmISim is able to cover a complete AmI system and to provide a framework which can test scenarios that would be impossible to test in real environments or even with previous simulation approaches. Simulated and real elements coexist in AmISim for a robust testing, validation and verification of the AmI systems, which provide an easier and less costly deployment.",92
"Werner syndrome (i.e., adult progeria) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations of the WRN gene, which is characterized by the premature appearance of features associated with normal aging and cancer predisposition. Patients with Werner syndrome can present with musculoskeletal complaints, associated with suggestive radiographic features with a potential prognostic or therapeutic impact. This review illustrates the main radiographic features of Werner syndrome, focusing on the musculoskeletal system, such as soft-tissue calcification, muscular atrophy, osteoporosis, foot deformities, osteitis and osteomyelitis, and bone or soft-tissues malignancies. The identification of these features by radiologists can therefore be useful in the clinical screening of Werner syndrome. (C) 2016 Editions franc, aises de radiologie.

"The Japanese Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Allergic Diseases 2017 (JAGL 2017) includes a minor revision of the Japanese Pediatric Guideline for the Treatment and Management of Asthma 2012 (JPGL 2012) by the Japanese Society of Pediatric Allergy and Clinical Immunology. The section on child asthma in JAGL 2017 provides information on how to diagnose asthma between infancy and adolescence (0-15 years of age). It makes recommendations for best practices in the management of childhood asthma, including management of acute exacerbations and non-pharmacological and pharmacological management. This guideline will be of interest to non-specialist physicians involved in the care of children with asthma. JAGL differs from the Global Initiative for Asthma Guideline in that JAGL emphasizes diagnosis and early intervention of children with asthma at <2 years or 2-5 years of age. The first choice of treatment depends on the severity and frequency of symptoms. Pharmacological management, including step-up or step-down of drugs used for long-term management based on the status of asthma control levels, is easy to understand; thus, this guideline is suitable for the routine medical care of children with asthma. JAGL also recommends using a control test in children, so that the physician aims for complete control by avoiding exacerbating factors and appropriately using anti-inflammatory drugs (for example, inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene receptor antagonists).

"Manganese (Mn) is required in various human physiological processes. Excessive Mn exposure causes manganism, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder similar to idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD). However, the detailed mechanism of Mn-induced neurotoxicity is not yet fully understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in gene expression regulation, and miRNA expression profile provides additional biological and prognostic information of diseases. In our study, RNA sequencing was performed to profile miRNAs in the SH-SY5Y cells following MnCl2 treatment. Expressions of 73 miRNAs were altered following excessive Mn treatment. Furthermore, has-miR-4306 was identified to target 3'UTR of ATP13A2 (PARK9) directly. Inhibition of has-miR-4306 efficiently restored Mn-induced cytotoxicity. Thus, for the first time, we revealed the miRNA effects of Mn ions to neuron cells, highlighted the involvement of miRNA regulation in neurodegeneration caused by Mn exposure, and provided a potential application of miRNAs in future therapeutic intervention.

"Background: Current obesity theories suggest that the repeated intake of highly palatable high-sugar foods causes adaptions in the striatum, parietal lobe, and prefrontal and visual cortices in the brain that may serve to perpetuate consumption in a feed-forward manner. However, the data for humans are cross-sectional and observational, leaving little ability to determine the temporal precedence of repeated consumption on brain response. Objective: We tested the impact of regular sugar-sweetened beverage intake on brain and behavioral responses to beverage stimuli. Design: We performed an experiment with 20 healthy-weight individuals who were randomly assigned to consume 1 of 2 sugar-sweetened beverages daily for 21 d, underwent 2 functional MRI sessions, and completed behavioral and explicit hedonic assessments. Results: Consistent with preclinical experiments, daily beverage consumption resulted in decreases in dorsal striatal response during receipt of the consumed beverage (r = -0.46) and decreased ventromedial prefrontal response during logo-elicited anticipation (r = -0.44). This decrease in the prefrontal response correlated with increases in behavioral disinhibition toward the logo of the consumed beverage (r = 0.54; P = 0.02). Daily beverage consumption also increased precuneus response to both juice logos compared with a tasteless control (r = 0.45), suggesting a more generalized effect toward beverage cues. Last, the repeated consumption of 1 beverage resulted in an explicit hedonic devaluation of a similar nonconsumed beverage (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Analogous to previous reports, these initial results provide convergent data for a role of regular sugar-sweetened beverage intake in altering neurobehavioral responses to the regularly consumed beverage that may also extend to other beverage stimuli. Future research is required to provide evidence of replication in a larger sample and to establish whether the neurobehavioral adaptations observed herein are specific to high-sugar and/or nonnutritive-sweetened beverages or more generally related to the repeated consumption of any type of food.",104
"Rapid transport of water and solutes through desiccation soil cracks can lead to crop water and nutrient stress. The challenge of irrigation management of cracking soils is to take advantage of the rapid water intake rate of a dry, cracked soil, while keeping plant water stress at a minimum. Therefore, mitigation not suppression of desiccation cracks is imperative and considered our objective of this study. A laboratory experiment was carried out to investigate the effects of sugarcane pith additive on mitigating desiccation cracks, the volumetric shrinkage strain, the total porosity, and water retention at field capacity of clay soils. The clay soil was treated with the sugarcane pith at dosages of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5% on dry weight basis. Various experimental methods were used to determine the variations in volumetric shrinkage, total porosity and water retention at field capacity. The characteristics of crack patterns were studied using an image processing technique. Compared with the untreated soil, the results showed that the sugarcane pith can increase the total porosity and water content at field capacity, while reducing volumetric shrinkage strain, and consequently, mitigating the development of desiccation cracks. Therefore, results suggested that the modification of clayey soil by the addition of the sugarcane pith by rates up to 2% on dry weight basis can be a viable and innovative method to mitigate the development of desiccation cracks. In addition, this application will enhance recycling efforts by converting sugarcane pith waste into usable amendment to mitigate cracks in clayey soil. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

"This paper presents the results of studying the spatial distribution of the maximum monthly rainfall within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) using geographic information systems (GIS). Isohyetal maps were constructed based on long historical rainfall depth data (1963-2013) of 255 rain gauges, after processing the data using different interpolation methods and their conversion to grid raster. Six interpolation methods were used: (a) kriging, (b) spline, (c) natural neighbor, (d) inverse distance weighting (IDW), (e) modified Shepard, and (f) triangulation with linear interpolation (TIN). Estimations of the rainfall at the rain gauges were compared to the observed measurements as controls and the method that resulted in minimum residuals and minimum standard deviation; in this case, the IDW was selected for the study. The percentage of residuals within +/- 2.0 mm were found to be 98 % for IDW, modified Shepard, and TIN, 97 % for natural neighbor, 90 % for spline, and 32 % for kriging. While identifying potential water harvesting sites depends on many factors, such as watershed area, topography, morphology, and rainfall, the results of this study can be used for the primary selection of water harvesting sites based on rainfall being the most important factor.",95
"Catering for children with food allergies in school canteens falls entirely within the ambit of the Individualised Meal Project (PAD. Although national educational staff enjoy the support of medical personnel, canteen staff to prepare and occasionally package meals, are employed by local authorities and thus only rarely undergo training in good practices in catering for children with food allergies. The Franche-Comte and Ecology Network (Menu d'allergologie de Franche-comTe RAFT) has created and now proposes training for such staff. The present article sets out the methodology of the course, the tools developed, and its evaluation. To date, 23 training sessions have been conducted in the region, and have enabled training of 439 staff members, from institutions dealing with small children to secondary schools. The evaluation questionnaire comprising 11 questions enabling the collection of spontaneous comments, was sent out to 127 of the primary school staff who underwent training. Sixty-one questionnaires (48%) were completed. The majority of staff answering the questionnaire indicated that they had acquired new knowledge, in particular regarding allergen labeling. They have a greater working knowledge of the procedures recommended under the PAI. They felt themselves to be better prepared in catering for children with food allergies. They had a better understanding of the various people involved and after their training, they were able to cater more successfully for children with food allergies without offering separate meals for this population. The success of this project was partly due to the creation of a training course developed over time, with the complete involvement of the actors concerned and within an institutional framework. Further training sessions have been scheduled, and these will be given by RAFT staff members. A partnership programme will soon enable this action to be extended to the entire Bourgogne-Franche-Comte region. It is our hope that the experience acquired in this project may soon be utilised by other regions. (C)2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",105
"Background: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) can offer compelling evidence for protein function, especially when viewed in the context of proteome-wide interactomes. Bacteria have been popular subjects of interactome studies: more than six different bacterial species have been the subjects of comprehensive interactome studies while several more have had substantial segments of their proteomes screened for interactions. The protein interactomes of several bacterial species have been completed, including several from prominent human pathogens. The availability of interactome data has brought challenges, as these large data sets are difficult to compare across species, limiting their usefulness for broad studies of microbial genetics and evolution. Results: In this study, we use more than 52,000 unique protein-protein interactions ( PPIs) across 349 different bacterial species and strains to determine their conservation across data sets and taxonomic groups. When proteins are collapsed into orthologous groups (OGs) the resulting meta-interactome still includes more than 43,000 interactions, about 14,000 of which involve proteins of unknown function. While conserved interactions provide support for protein function in their respective species data, we found only 429 PPIs (similar to 1% of the available data) conserved in two or more species, rendering any cross-species interactome comparison immediately useful. The meta-interactome serves as a model for predicting interactions, protein functions, and even full interactome sizes for species with limited to no experimentally observed PPI, including Bacillus subtilis and Salmonella enterica which are predicted to have up to 18,000 and 31,000 PPIs, respectively. Conclusions: In the course of this work, we have assembled cross-species interactome comparisons that will allow interactomics researchers to anticipate the structures of yet-unexplored microbial interactomes and to focus on well-conserved yet uncharacterized interactors for further study. Such conserved interactions should provide evidence for important but yet-uncharacterized aspects of bacterial physiology and may provide targets for anti-microbial therapies.",34
"Failure to understand evolutionary dynamics has been hypothesized as limiting our ability to control biological systems. An increasing awareness of similarities between macroscopic ecosystems and cellular tissues has inspired optimism that game theory will provide insights into the progression and control of cancer. To realize this potential, the ability to compare game theoretic models and experimental measurements of population dynamics should be broadly disseminated. In this tutorial, we present an analysis method that can be used to train parameters in game theoretic dynamics equations, used to validate the resulting equations, and used to make predictions to challenge these equations and to design treatment strategies. The data analysis techniques in this tutorial are adapted from the analysis of reaction kinetics using the method of initial rates taught in undergraduate general chemistry courses. Reliance on computer programming is avoided to encourage the adoption of these methods as routine bench activities.",40
"Fused deposition modeling (FDM) has been recognized as an effective technology to manufacture 3D dimensional parts directly from a digital computer aided design (CAD) model in a layer-by-layer style. Although it has become a significantly important manufacturing process, but it is still not well accepted additive manufacturing technology for load-carrying parts under dynamic and cyclic conditions due to many processing parameters affecting the part properties. The purpose of this study is to characterize the FDM manufactured parts by detecting how the individual and interactive FDM process parameters will influence the performance of manufactured products under dynamic and cyclic conditions. Experiments were conducted through fractional factorial design and artificial neural network (ANN). Effect of each parameter on the dynamic modulus of elasticity was investigated using analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique. Furthermore, optimal processing parameters were determined and validated by conducting verification experiment. The results showed that both ANN and fractional factorial models provided good quality predictions, yet the ANN showed the superiority of a properly trained ANN in capturing the nonlinear relationship of the system over fractional factorial for both data fitting and estimation capabilities.

"In this study, three different types of scaffolds including a uniquely modified composite scaffold - namely chitosan (CTS), nano-hydroxyapatite/chitosan composite (CTS + nHAP), and amine group (NH2) modified nano-hydroxyapatite/chitosan composite (CTS + nHAP-NH2) scaffolds- were synthesized for bone tissue engineering (BTE) purposes. As results of the study, it was found that all scaffold types were biodegradable with CTS and CTS + nHAP scaffolds losing up to 15% of their initial weight, while the CTS + nHAP-NH2 scaffold showing 10% of weight loss after six weeks of lysozyme treatment. In addition, all three types of scaffolds were shown to be biocompatible, and amongst them CTS + nHAP-NH2 scaffolds supported the most cell proliferation in WST-1 assay and expressed the least and acceptable level of cytotoxicity in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) test for human bone mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs). Finally, during osteoinductivity assessment, CTS + nHAP-NH2 nearly tripled initial alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity when whereas both CTS and CTS + nHAP scaffolds only doubled. These results indicate that all synthesized scaffold types under investigation have certain potential to be used in bone tissue engineering approaches with CTS + nHAP-NH2 scaffold being the most promising and applicable one. In the future, we plan to intensify our studies on osteogenic differentiation on our scaffolds on a detailed molecular level and to include in vivo studies for pre-clinical purposes.

"IgE-mediated allergies, in particular allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma, have reached epidemic proportions, affecting about one-third of the population in developed countries. The most effective treatment for allergies is specific immunotherapy (SIT), which involves the injection of increasing doses of an allergen extract to allergic individuals. The current form of SIT was first introduced in 1911 and recently celebrated its 100th birthday for the treatment of hay fever. The concept of this therapy at the time was straightforward, as it was believed that pollen contained toxins against which the patient could be vaccinated. However, the understanding became blurred with the discovery that IgE antibodies were the effector molecules of the allergic response. Subsequent research focused on the idea that SIT should induce tolerance keeping the IgE antibodies at bay. In this review, we will discuss the various hypotheses for the mechanism of SIT and we will put forward the concept that allergens may be viewed as protoxins' which need to be activated by IgE antibodies. Within this framework, protoxin-neutralizing antibodies are the key effector molecules while a shift to Th1 or Treg cells mainly contributes to the efficacy of SIT by helping B cells to produce neutralizing IgG antibodies.",105
"Due to the increasing vulnerabilities in cyberspace, security alone is not enough to prevent a breach, but cyber forensics or cyber intelligence is also required to prevent future attacks or to identify the potential attacker. The unobtrusive and covert nature of biometric data collection of keystroke dynamics has a high potential for use in cyber forensics or cyber intelligence. In this paper, we investigate the usefulness of keystroke dynamics to establish the person identity. We propose three schemes for identifying a person when typing on a keyboard. We use various machine learning algorithms in combination with the proposed pairwise user coupling technique and show the performance of each separate technique as well as the performance when combining two or more together. In particular, we show that pairwise user coupling in a bottom-up tree structure scheme gives the best performance, both concerning accuracy and time complexity. The proposed techniques are validated by using keystroke data. However, these techniques could equally well be applied to other pattern identification problems. We have also investigated the optimized feature set for person identification by using keystroke dynamics. Finally, we also examined the performance of the identification system when a user, unlike his normal behaviour, types with only one hand, and we show that performance then is not optimal, as was to be expected.",1
"Vein of Marshall in AF Ablation IntroductionThe ligament of Marshall may hinder the creation of mitral isthmus (MI) block or pulmonary vein (PV) isolation (PVI) in radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF). We aimed to assess the benefit of RF ablation targeting the vein of Marshall (VOM) in failed cases of MI block or PVI. Methods and ResultsWe reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent RF ablation targeting the VOM after failed MI ablation or left PVI using the conventional method, which included circumferential point-by-point ablation around the PV antrum and carina for PVI, and endocardial MI and epicardial distal coronary sinus (CS) ablation for MI block. The VOM was identified by using selective VOM venography with an external irrigation RF ablation catheter. RF ablation targeting the VOM was performed with RF application at the ostium of the VOM inside the CS or at the endocardial region facing the VOM course. During the set period, CS venography was performed in 42 patients after failure of left PVI (n = 5) or MI block (n = 37). Under CS venography, the VOM was visualized in 22 of 42 patients (MI = 19 and PVI = 3). During selective venography of the VOM, no procedure-related complication was observed. RF application targeting the VOM successfully achieved MI block in 13 patients (68.4%) and PVI in 2 patients (66.7%). ConclusionSelective VOM venography using an irrigated ablation catheter is feasible and safe. RF ablation targeting the VOM may provide additional benefit in failed cases of MI block or PVI.",111
"We consider a population of dynamic agents, also referred to as players. The state of each player evolves according to a linear stochastic differential equation driven by a Brownian motion and under the influence of a control and an adversarial disturbance. Every player minimizes a cost functional which involves quadratic terms on state and control plus a cross-coupling mean-field term measuring the congestion resulting from the collective behavior, which motivates the term ""crowd-averse."" Motivations for this model are analyzed and discussed in three main contexts: a stock market application, a production engineering example, and a dynamic demand management problem in power systems. For the problem in its abstract formulation, we illustrate the paradigm of robust mean-field games. Main contributions involve first the formulation of the problem as a robust mean-field game; second, the development of a new approximate solution approach based on the extension of the state space; third, a relaxation method to minimize the approximation error. Further results are provided for the scalar case, for which we establish performance bounds, and analyze stochastic stability of both the microscopic and the macroscopic dynamics.",55
"Introduction: Depressive symptoms are very common in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and have a significant impact on the quality of life. Methods: The present study analyzed the correlations between over-time changes in depressive symptoms and gray matter parameters of cortical thickness and subcortical volumes in non-demented PD patients. Results: A significant correlation was observed, between increased scores for depression over time and lower cortical thickness over time in the right temporo-parietal junction, right occipital medial region, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, right posterior cingulate region, left middle temporal as well as left supplementary motor area. Furthermore, the presence of depressive symptoms at baseline predicted increased cortical thinning over time in the left middle temporal, left anterior cingulate, right posterior cingulate and right parahippocampal cortices. Finally, a statistically significant negative correlation has been revealed between the thalamus' volume changes over time and the change in depressive symptoms scores. All other analyzed subcortical structures didn't reveal any significant correlations. Conclusion: These results suggest that depressive symptoms in PD patients are associated with gray matter cortical thinning and thalamus volume shrinkage over time and higher scores of depressive symptoms at baseline correlate with a higher rate of cortical thinning longitudinally. The present study highlights the importance of addressing depressive symptoms in PD patients early in the disease. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",62
"Objective: Treatment guidelines published world-wide have highlighted concerns of increased metabolic risks associated with second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs). The aim of the study was to evaluate blood glucose monitoring rates for SGA new users in older people aged 65 years and above during the study period 2006-2012, and investigate the pre-post 2007 Best Practice Advocacy Centre's (bpac(nz)) glucose monitoring recommendation in New Zealand. Methods: The study was a population-based retrospective cohort of SGA new users (365 days without pre-exposure to antipsychotics). Pharmaceutical collections data were extracted and used to identify older people dispensed SGAs and linked to the National Minimum Dataset and Laboratory Claims collection. WHO Methodology's Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical method's classification was used to characterise the SGAs dispensed. Results: Of the 25,603 new users dispensed SGAs, 63.5% received glycaemic control monitoring at least once during the study period. Of these, only 20.1% were monitored at baseline, 38.7% were monitored for glycaemic control within the first 90 days. Glycaemic control monitoring within the first 180 days increased to more than half (57.5%) of the SGA new users. Proportion of individuals monitored were independent (chi(2) = 6.1; P = 0.4) of pre-post bpac(nz) recommendation. Conclusions: Blood glucose monitoring was underutilized in new SGA users. No significant improvement in glycaemic control monitoring was observed after the 2007 bpac(nz) consensus statement release at baseline, 90 days and at 180 days. Prescribers must be cautioned about the metabolic risks posed by SGAs and recommend glycaemic control monitoring. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",72
"In this article, a new formula expressing explicitly the squares of Jacobi polynomials of certain parameters in terms of Jacobi polynomials of arbitrary parameters is derived. The derived formula is given in terms of ceratin terminating hypergeometric function of the type F-4(3)(1). In some cases, this F-4(3)(1) can be reduced by using some well-known reduction formulae in literature such as Watson's and Pfaff-Saalschiitz's identities. In some other cases, this F-4(3)(1) can be reduced by means of symbolic computation, and in particular Zeilberger's, Petkovsek's and van Hoeij's algorithms. Hence, some new squares formulae for Jacobi polynomials of special parameters can be deduced in reduced forms which are free of any hypergeometric functions.",24
"It is well established that transpiration and photosynthetic rates generally increase in resprouting shoots after fire in chaparral shrublands. By contrast, little is known about how plant hydraulic function varies during this same recovery period. We hypothesized that vascular traits, both functional and structural, would also shift in order to support this heightened level of gas exchange and growth. We examined stem xylem-specific hydraulic conductivity (K-s) and resistance to cavitation (P-50) for eight chaparral shrub species as well as several potential xylem structural determinants of hydraulic function and compared established unburned plants and co-occurring post-fire resprouting plants. Unburned plants were generally more resistant to cavitation than resprouting plants, but the two groups did not differ in K-s. Resprouting plants had altered vessel structure compared with unburned plants, with resprouting plants having both wider diameter vessels and higher inter-vessel pit density. For biomechanics, unburned plants had both stronger and denser stem xylem tissue than resprouting plants. Shifts in hydraulic structure and function resulted in resprouting plants being more vulnerable to dehydration. The interaction between time since disturbance (i.e. resprouting versus established stands) and drought may complicate attempts to predict mortality risk of resprouting plants. It is well established that transpiration and photosynthetic rates generally increase in resprouting plants after fire in chaparral shrublands, but little is known about how plant hydraulic function varies during this same recovery period. The ecophysiology of eight species of chaparral shrubs was compared between resprouting plants and adjacent unburned plants. Resprouting plants varied from unburned plants in their hydraulics, xylem structure and biomechanics. The observed shifts resulted in resprouting plants being more vulnerable to dehydration than unburned plants and demonstrate potential variability of plants in their hydraulic physiology depending on disturbance recovery state.",83
"Normalization of the tumor microenvironment by selectively targeting components of the tumor extracellular matrix has been recently proposed to have the potential to decompress tumor blood vessels, increase vessel perfusion and thus, improve drug delivery and the efficacy of cancer therapy. Therefore, we now need to identify safe and well tolerated pharmaceutical agents that are able to remodel the microenvironment of solid tumors and enhance chemotherapy. In this study, we repurposed Pirfenidone, a clinically approved anti-fibrotic drug for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, to investigate its possible role on tumor microenvironment normalization. Using two orthotopic mammary tumor models we demonstrate that Pirfenidone reduces collagen and hyaluronan levels and, as a result, significantly increases blood vessel functionality and perfusion and improves the antitumor efficacy of doxorubicin. Reduction of extracellular matrix components were mediated via TGF beta signaling pathway inhibition due to downregulation of TGF beta 1, COL1A1, COL3A1, HAS2, HAS3 expression levels. Our findings provide evidence that repurposing Pirfenidone could be used as a promising strategy to enhance drug delivery to solid tumors by normalizing the tumor microenvironment.",3
"Many researchers have highlighted the scarcity of empirical studies that systematically examine the advantages and disadvantages of the use of visualization techniques for software understanding activities. Such studies are crucial for gathering and analyzing objective and quantifiable evidence about the usefulness of proposed visualization techniques and tools, and ultimately, for guiding the research in software visualization. This paper presents a controlled experiment aimed at assessing the impact of a graph-based visualization technique on comprehension tasks. Six common comprehension tasks were performed by 20 undergraduate software engineering students. The completion time and the accuracy of the participants' responses were measured. The results indicate that on one hand the use of the graph-based visualization increases the correctness (by 21.45% in average) but on the other hand it does not reduce the completion time in program comprehension tasks.",123
"The control system of moving mirror scanning is an important part of the Fourier transform spectrometer, and its dynamic and static performance determines the interference effect and the spectral resolution of the spectrometer. To meet the requirement of the uniform velocity of moving mirror scanning, a completely digital control scheme is proposed with FPGA as the key hardware, and this scheme is applied to the moving mirror movement in the spectrometer. According to the need of the current detection and the velocity detection, a dual closed loop control composed of current loop and velocity loop is realized, with current loop and velocity loop using PI control and fuzzy PID control respectively. The experiment results show that the current curve is smooth in the uniform scan phase of moving mirror, and that the peak current is 0.5 A in acceleration and deceleration period. Additionally, when the angular velocity of moving mirror is 30/s in the uniform section, the maximum relative error is less than 4%. From research results, it can be drawn that the digital control strategy can significantly improve the velocity stability of moving mirror, and meet the performance requirements of the control system.

"This paper provided a validated modeling and a simulation of a 6 degree freedom vehicle longitudinal model and drive-train component in a series hybrid electric vehicle. The 6-DOF vehicle dynamics model consisted of tire subsystems, permanent magnet synchronous motor which acted as the prime mover coupled with an automatic transmission, hydraulic brake subsystem, battery subsystem, alternator subsystem and internal combustion engine to supply the rotational input to the alternator. A speed and torque tracking control systems of the electric power train were developed to make sure that the power train was able to produce the desired throttle torque in accelerating the vehicle. A human-in-the-loop-simulation was utilized as a mechanism to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid electric vehicle. The proposed simulation was used as the preliminary result in identifying the capability of the vehicle in terms of the maximum speed produced by the vehicle and the capability of the alternator to recharge the battery. Several tests had been done during the simulation, namely sudden acceleration, acceleration and braking test and unbounded motion. The results of the simulation showed that the proposed hybrid electric vehicle can produce a speed of up to 70 km/h with a reasonable charging rate to the battery. The findings from this study can be considered in terms of design, optimization and implementation in a real vehicle.",87
"The efforts for more reliable power conversion systems have been gaining momentum in recent years. The majority of the studies concerning reliability of power switches focus on the package-related failures, mainly caused by the cyclic thermal stress. The basic failure precursor for this type of stress has been identified as increased on-state resistance for power MOSFETs in the recent literature. On-state resistance monitoring during converter operation is a challenging and costly task as it requires current and voltage sensing circuits, which can block the high voltage across the switch during off-state to protect the measurement or control unit. This paper proposes a software frequency response analysis method to determine the health status of high-voltage power MOSFETs with high on-state resistance. This is achieved by analyzing and evaluating the variation in the plant model at double pole frequency using the same DSP that is used for control purposes. The proposed concept is analyzed for boost converter; however, it can be used to detect the on-state resistance variation in other types of converters operating in continuous condition mode (CCM). The proposed algorithm is embedded in a low cost DSP and experimentally verified on a dc/dc boost converter.",48
"This account of the beginnings and later applications of the use of nuclear magnetic resonance for noninvasive medical diagnosis was presented at a Symposium held in Oxford, UK, during September 13-15, 2000 to mark the centenary of the birth of Hans Krebs, on August 25, 1900.",32
"Multilevel inverters are nowadays widely used in high-power and high-voltage applications. A multilevel inverter synthesizes a large number of levels to get the desired output voltage levels and they have lot of merits such as improved output waveform, smaller passive filter size, lower Electro Magnetic Interference and reduced harmonics. However, multilevel inverters also have some disadvantages such as increased number of components, voltage-balancing problem and higher switching losses. This paper presents a PI and PID Controlled Cascaded H-bridge eleven level inverter based sinusoidal pulse width modulation control technique suitable for improved power quality applications. The main objective of reducing the THD of output of the chosen eleven level cascaded inverter under set point tracking as well as steady-state with fast transient response are proposed from control point of view. Simulation results have been discussed that the cascaded H-bridge eleven level inverter performs perfectly in connection with PI or PID. A comparative analysis of these two different controllers is revealed. Harmonic spectrum and output voltage and current waveforms have been obtained to validate the role of controllers. Experimental results are presented to confirm the simulation results.",59
"Objective: Determine healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) in biologic-naive initiators of TNF inhibitors (TNFis) associated with their disease activity from a national cohort of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Methods: RA patients were identified at their first TNFi initiation (index date) in the Corrona registry. Patients with age of RA onset <18, comorbid psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis, fibromyalgia, or osteoarthritis were excluded. Patients were categorized into disease activity (DA) strata by the lowest level of DA (and sustaining low levels for at least two visits) using the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) across all visits in Corrona while on a TNFi during 1 year after initiation. Rates of all-cause and RA-related hospitalizations, rheumatologist visits, and joint surgeries while on TNFi therapy were reported and compared across DA levels along with the incidence rate ratio (IRR) adjusted for age, gender, and RA duration using Poisson mixed models. Results: Of 1931 RA patients: 15% achieved sustained remission, 22% remission, 14% sustained low DA, 23% low DA and 27% moderate/high DA (M/HDA). Those in M/HDA had statistically higher rates of hospitalizations (37.3 per 100 patient years (py), 95% CI: 31.6-43.7 and joint surgeries (20.8 per 100 py, 95% CI: 16.6-25.8) compared to the sustained remission cohort, resulting in respective IRRs of 2.3 (p<0.001) and 1.7 (p=0.046). Conclusion: Many biologic naive RA patients initiating TNFi failed to achieve sustained remission during a 1 year period while remaining on TNFi therapy. Patients in higher DA levels had higher HCRU rates vs. patients in sustained remission, suggesting that achieving treat-to-target goals would reduce health care expenses.",22
"Recent studies provided evidence for an impact of social relations on preschool children's sharing behavior. Children have been shown to be more generous towards friends than nonfriends or strangers. As evidence comes largely from studies with western children, little is known about cross-cultural differences and commonalities in this pattern. Here, we show that preschool and elementary school aged Ugandan children show high levels of generosity independent of the social relationships with the recipient. This finding points to societal differences in early sharing. The results are discussed in terms of a formative impact of cultural traditions on the early development of sharing in the preschool years.",65
"Image enhancement and edge-preserving denoising are relevant steps before classification or other postprocessing techniques for remote sensing images. However, multisensor array systems are able to simultaneously capture several low-resolution images from the same area on different wavelengths, forming a high spatial/spectral resolution image and raising a series of new challenges. In this paper, an open computing language based parallel implementation approach is presented for near real-time enhancement based on Bayesian maximum entropy (BME), as well as an edge-preserving denoising algorithm for remote sensing imagery, which uses the local linear Stein's unbiased risk estimate (LLSURE). BME was selected for its results on synthetic aperture radar image enhancement, whereas LLSURE has shown better noise removal properties than other commonly used methods. Within this context, image processing methods are algorithmically adapted via parallel computing techniques and efficiently implemented using CPUs and commodity graphics processing units (GPUs). Experimental results demonstrate the reduction of computational load of real-world image processing for near real-time GPU adapted implementation.",101
"Both normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been associated with a reduction in functional brain connectivity. It is unknown how connectivity patterns due to aging and AD compare. Here, we investigate functional brain connectivity in 12 young adults (mean age 22.8 +/- 2.8), 12 older adults (mean age 73.1 +/- 5.2) and 12 AD patients (mean age 74.0 +/- 5.2; mean MMSE 22.3 +/- 2.5). Participants were scanned during 6 different sessions with resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI), resulting in 72 scans per group. Voxelwise connectivity with 10 functional networks was compared between groups (p < 0.05, corrected). Normal aging was characterized by widespread decreases in connectivity with multiple brain networks, whereas AD only affected connectivity between the default mode network (DMN) and precuneus. The preponderance of effects was associated with regional gray matter volume. Our findings indicate that aging has amajor effect on functional brain interactions throughout the entire brain, whereas AD is distinguished by additional diminished posterior DMN-precuneus coherence.",106
"Distributed video coding (DVC) provides a different compression paradigm that consists of lightweight encoder and complex decoder. This compression paradigm shed a light for nowadays mobile devices which equipped with limited battery and computing resources while the corresponding multimedia service is backed up by cloud computing infrastructures. After years of developing, the coding performance and the decoding speed of DVC are still facing serious challenges, for example, DVC's rate-distortion (RD) performance is far behind the traditional prediction based video codec (e.g., H. 264) and the required decoding complexity handicaps its value in practical usage. In order to meet these challenges, we propose an efficient real-time DVC framework with progressive side information regeneration by taking GPGPU-based parallel computing into account. The proposed system can resolve one of the achilles' heels, i.e., the large group of picture scenario, of DVC codec with good RD performance and much improved decoding speed. The Bjontegaard Delta peak signal-to-noise ratio improvement of our system is up to 2.87 dB as compared with DISCOVER codec, which is also comparable with that of the state-of-the-art optical flow-based DVC codecs. The average decoding speed goes up to 22.44 frames per second (FPS) and even up to 76.35 FPS for Hall sequence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first DVC codec which tackles the RD performance and the decoding speed issues simultaneously.",101
"A crucial step in the use of DNA markers for biodiversity surveys is the assignment of Linnaean taxonomies (species, genus, etc.) to sequence reads. This allows the use of all the information known based on the taxonomic names. Taxonomic placement of DNA barcoding sequences is inherently probabilistic because DNA sequences contain errors, because there is natural variation among sequences within a species, and because reference data bases are incomplete and can have false annotations. However, most existing bioinformatics methods for taxonomic placement either exclude uncertainty, or quantify it using metrics other than probability. In this paper we evaluate the performance of the recently proposed probabilistic taxonomic placement method PROTAX by applying it to both annotated reference sequence data as well as to unknown environmental data. Our four case studies include contrasting taxonomic groups (fungi, bacteria, mammals and insects), variation in the length and quality of the barcoding sequences (from individually Sanger-sequenced sequences to short Illumina reads), variation in the structures and sizes of the taxonomies (800-130000 species) and variation in the completeness of the reference data bases (representing 15-100% of known species). Our results demonstrate that PROTAX yields essentially unbiased probabilities of taxonomic placement, which means its quantification of species identification uncertainty is reliable. As expected, the accuracy of taxonomic placement increases with increasing coverage of taxonomic and reference sequence data bases, and with increasing ratio of genetic variation among taxonomic levels over within taxonomic levels. We conclude that reliable species-level identification from environmental samples is still challenging and that neglecting identification uncertainty can lead to spurious inference. A key aim for future research is the completion of taxonomic and reference sequence data bases and making these two types of data compatible.",42
"As construction projects become larger and more diversified, various factors such as time, cost, quality, environment, and safety that need to be considered make it very difficult to make the final decision. This study was conducted to develop an integrated Multi-Objective Optimization (iMOO) model that provides the optimal solution set based on the concept of the Pareto front, through the following six steps: (1) problem statement; (2) definition of the optimization objectives; (3) establishment of the data structure; (4) standardization of the optimization objectives; (5) definition of the fitness function; and (6) introduction of the genetic algorithm. To evaluate the robustness and reliability of the proposed iMOO model, a case study on the construction time-cost trade-off problem was analyzed in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. The results of this study can be used: (1) to assess more than two optimization objectives, such as the initial investment cost, operation and maintenance cost, and CO2 emission trading cost; (2) to take advantage of the weights as the real meanings; (3) to evaluate the four types of fitness functions; and (4) to expand into other areas such as the indoor air quality, materials, and energy use.",102
"For musculoskeletal complaints (MSCs) among adults, several risk factors are known, but the most important determinant is an earlier episode of MSCs. Research has shifted to younger ages, showing a high prevalence of MSCs among children and adolescents. Our purpose was to evaluate the prevalence of MSCs among those growing up from age 11 to 14 and to explore the role of several sociodemographic, growth and development, psychosocial, and lifestyle factors. Data collected at age 11 (n = 2651) and age 14 (n = 2522) in the ongoing Dutch Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy (PIAMA) birth cohort study were used. Analyses included multiple logistic regression analyses using stepwise backward selection. The 1-year prevalence of any MSCs for at least 1 month increased from 15.8% at age 11 to 24.4% at age 14, and this was also found for upper extremity complaints (from 4.7% to 7.6%), back complaints (from 2.7% to 9.3%), and lower extremity complaints (from 11.9% to 14.7%). More MSCs were found among girls, those with sports injuries, those with sleeping problems, and those with daytime tiredness, although complaints at age 11 were by far the most important factor associated with MSCs at age 14 for all pain sites. This study showed that MSC is already common at an early age and that already at age 14 the factor with the strongest association is an earlier episode of MSCs. Sleeping problems and tiredness may also play a role in the early development of MSCs, either as determinant or as a consequence.",27
The evolution of the concept of child abuse leads to consider new types of maltreatment that in the future will certainly be taken into account with a new era of social pediatrics. Pediatric care has been based on the increased awareness of the importance of meeting the psychosocial and developmental needs of children and of the role of families in promoting the health.,76
"Water is a crucial resource in West Africa, where large parts of the population rely on rainfed agriculture. Therefore, accurate knowledge of the water resources is of the utmost importance. Due to the declining number of rain gauging stations, the use of satellite and reanalysis precipitation datasets in hydrological modelling is steadily rising. However, accurate information on the benefits and deficits of these datasets is often lacking, especially in the West African subcontinent. For validation purposes, these products are commonly compared to freely available rain gauge data, which has in some cases already been used to bias correct the products in the first place. We therefore explored the possibility of a hydrological evaluation, where a model is calibrated for each dataset using streamflow as the observed variable. In this study, ten freely available satellite and reanalysis datasets (CFSR, CHIRPS, CMORPHv1.0 CRT, CMORPHv1.0 RAW, PERSIANN CDR, RFE 2.0, TAMSAT, TMPA 3B42v7, TMPA 3B42 RTv7 and GPCC FDDvl) were thus evaluated for six differently sized and located basins in West Africa. Results show that while performances differ, most datasets manage to somewhat accurately predict the observed stream flow in a given basin. Best results were achieved by datasets which use a multitude of input data, namely infrared and microwave satellite data, as well as observations from rain gauges (usually GPCC) for bias correction. If considering only the Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency averaged for all six basins during the calibration phase, best results were achieved by CMORPH CRT and PERSIANN CDR (both 0.66), followed by TAMSAT, CHIRPS and TMPA 3B42 (all three 0.64). Average results were achieved by RFE 2.0 (0.63), GPCC (0.61) and TMPA 3B42 RT (0.54). CMORPH RAW and CFSR performed worst (0.36 and -0.34 on average). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",94
"After its recent improvements described here, open source finite element software Elmer is shown to be a highly efficient option for electrical machine modeling. The parallelization of computational burden is shown to be a necessity. The methods implemented enable applying fully parallel computation to electrical machine models, including rotation and electrical circuits. Computational experiments performed demonstrate that Elmer can effectively utilize several hundreds of computational cores in parallel, making it an attractive alternative when computational speed is of high importance.",45
"Background: Within international Rugby Union, only injury rates during the Rugby World Cup have been reported. Therefore, injury rates and types during other international tournaments are unknown. Purpose: To assess the 3-year incidence, severity, nature, and causes of match and training injuries sustained during different international tournaments played by the Welsh national Rugby Union team. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: Injury data for all players (n = 78) selected for 1 national Rugby Union team over a 3-year period were analyzed using the international consensus statement methods. Player height (cm) and mass (kg) were recorded. Tournaments were grouped for comparisons as: autumn tournaments (2012 and 2013), Rugby World Cup (RWC; 2011), Six Nations (2012, 2013, and 2014), and summer tournaments (2012, 2013, and 2014). Injury incidence (injuries/1000 hours), prevalence (% of players unavailable), and severity (days lost) were calculated for each tournament. Injury location, type, and cause of match and training injuries were analyzed. Results: Match injury incidence was highest during autumn tournaments (262.5/1000 match-hours) and lowest during the RWC (178.6/1000 match-hours). Summer tournaments had the highest training incidence (5.5 injuries/1000 training-hours). Mild injuries were most likely during the RWC (risk ratio [RR], 2.02; 95% CI, 1.26-3.24), while severe injuries were most likely during autumn tournaments (RR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.70-6.29). Quadriceps hematomas (18.8/1000 match-hours; 95% CI, 11.3-31.1) and concussions (13.8/1000 match-hours; 95% CI, 7.6-24.8) were the most common match injuries, with shoulder dislocations being the most severe (111 mean days lost per injury). Conclusion: Injury rates were considerably higher than those previously reported for multiple teams during RWC tournaments. Further investigation of injury rates and risk factors is recommended to accurately gauge their impact within international Rugby Union, particularly with regard to lower limb hematoma, concussion, and shoulder injuries.",27
"Cardiovascular disease exerts an enormous burden on women's health. The intake of a healthy diet may reduce this burden. However, social norms and economic constraints are often factors that restrain women from paying attention to their diet. Underpinned by critical realism, this study explores how gender/sex influences decision-making regarding food consumption among women of low socioeconomic status (SES). The study was carried out at two cardiac facilities in Karachi, Pakistan, on 24 participants (male and female from different ethnic backgrounds), who had received health education. Using an interpretive descriptive approach, the study identified major barriers to a healthy diet: proscribed gender roles and lack of women's autonomy, power, male domination, and abusive behaviours. Cardiovascular risk and disease outcomes for the Pakistani women of low SES are likely to further escalate if individual and structural barriers are not reduced using multifactorial approaches.",77
"Gabor wavelet can extract most informative and efficient texture features for different computer vision and multimedia applications. Features extracted by Gabor wavelet have similar information as visualized by the receptive field of simple cells in the visual cortex of the mammalian brains. This motivates researchers to use Gabor wavelet for feature extraction. Gabor wavelet features are used for many multimedia applications such as stereo matching, face and facial expression recognition (FER), texture representation for segmentation. This motivates us to analyze Gabor features to evaluate their effectiveness in representing an image. In this paper, three major characteristics of Gabor features are established viz., (i) Real coefficients of Gabor wavelet alone is sufficient enough to represent an image; (ii) Local Gabor wavelet features with overlapping regions represent an image more accurately as compared to the global Gabor features and the local features extracted for the non-overlapping regions; and (iii) Real coefficients of overlapping regions are more robust to radiometric changes as compared to the features extracted from both global and local (non-overlapping regions) by using real, imaginary and magnitude information of a Gabor wavelet. The efficacy and effectiveness of these findings are evaluated by reconstructing the original image using the extracted features, and subsequently the reconstructed image is compared with the original image. Experimental results show that the local Gabor wavelet features extracted from overlapping regions represent an image more efficiently than the global and non-overlapping region-based features. Experimental results also show that the real coefficients alone is sufficient enough to represent an image more accurately as compared to the imaginary and magnitude informations.",0
"A new multi-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for Approximate Bayesian Computation, ABC-SubSim, has recently appeared that exploits the Subset Simulation method for efficient rare-event simulation. ABC-SubSim adaptively creates a nested decreasing sequence of data-approximating regions in the output space that correspond to increasingly closer approximations of the observed output vector in this output space. At each level, multiple samples of the model parameter vector are generated by a component-wise Metropolis algorithm so that the predicted output corresponding to each parameter value falls in the current data-approximating region. Theoretically, if continued to the limit, the sequence of data-approximating regions would converge on to the observed output vector and the approximate posterior distributions, which are conditional on the data approximation region, would become exact, but this is not practically feasible. In this paper we study the performance of the ABC-SubSim algorithm for Bayesian updating of the parameters of dynamical systems using a general hierarchical state-space model. We note that the ABC methodology gives an approximate posterior distribution that actually corresponds to an exact posterior where a uniformly distributed combined measurement and modeling error is added. We also note that ABC algorithms have a problem with learning the uncertain error variances in a stochastic state-space model and so we treat them as nuisance parameters and analytically integrate them out of the posterior distribution. In addition, the statistical efficiency of the original ABC-SubSim algorithm is improved by developing a novel strategy to regulate the proposal variance for the component-wise Metropolis algorithm at each level. We demonstrate that Self-regulated ABC-SubSim is well suited for Bayesian system identification by first applying it successfully to model updating of a two degree-of-freedom linear structure for three cases: globally, locally and unidentifiable model classes, and then to model updating of a two degree-of-freedom nonlinear structure with Duffing nonlinearities in its interstory force-deflection relationship.

"This longitudinal study examined relations between the physical quality of housing, neighborhood, and their interactive effect on the life course development of 341 U.S. rural children from ages 9-24 years. Standardized instruments assessed housing quality (structural, clutter/cleanliness, indoor climate, hazards. crowding/privacy) and neighborhood quality (street connectivity, density, land use mix; proximate building/sidewalk conditions; neighborhood stability; proximity to nature/amenities). Analyses focused on two critical components of child development: 1) psychological health and 2) helplessness. Growth curve analyses with multilevel modeling revealed that lower quality housing was associated with poorer psychological health (internalizing and externalizing symptoms) as well as marginally more helplessness on a behavioral task over 15 years, from ages 9-24 years. All analyses statistically controlled for income level. Neither neighborhood quality nor its interaction with housing quality was related to psychological health or motivation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"A rapid resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis was applied to human urine samples to discover new molecular biomarkers of the alteration of psychophysical well-being due to the environmental, physiological and confinement stress conditions achieved in the MARS500 project. Urine samples of crew members were submitted to metabolomic studies by means of separative techniques coupled with mass spectrometric techniques and data analysis. More than 2,000 metabolite features were found in each comparison, and more than 150 metabolites were identified for every differential analysis. Significant modifications in eight metabolites were shared by the subjects under study.",32
"Burying beetles (genus Nicrophorus) are relatively rare among insects in providing sophisticated parental care. Consequently, they have become model species in research analysing social evolution, the evolution of parental care and mating systems. We used the recently published N. vespilloides genome and transcriptome to develop microsatellite markers. Specifically, we developed 14 polymorphic markers with five to 13 alleles per locus and used them to investigate levels of genetic differentiation in four south Cambridgeshire (UK) populations of N. vespilloides, separated by 21 km at most. The markers revealed significant genetic structuring among populations (global F-ST = 0.023) with all but one of the pairwise comparisons among populations being significant. The single exception was the comparison between the two closest populations, which are approximately 2.5 km apart. In general, the microsatellite markers showed lower observed heterozygosity than expected. We infer that there is limited dispersal between populations and potentially also some inbreeding within them and suggest that this may be due to habitat fragmentation. We discuss these results in the context of recent laboratory experiments on inbreeding and beetle flight.",34
"In this paper we report about an approach to establish safety properties of cooperating systems in polynomial time, the state space of which can be exponentially large in the number of cooperating subsystems. It consists of constructing a family of so-called inducers of a system and the reduction of these by an operator we call Edge-Match. Furthermore, we draw a connection between our approach and the theory of relational databases. Aside from pointing out an interesting connection between these fields we use this connection to apply results from the theory of relational databases to our approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

"The neoliberal direction of social policy under New Zealand's fifth National government (2008-) is demonstrated in its 2012 White Paper for Vulnerable Children. This document advocates increased monitoring and policing of welfare populations and the downgrading of child protection policy to a technical administrative system for managing risky' families. The White Paper's release came soon after the coroner's report into the deaths of the Kahui twins', which were treated by the media as a shocking case of child abuse, and exemplified the media's use of a fantasy of a savage' Maori welfare underclass in reporting cases of child abuse. Drawing on Isin's analysis of governing through neurosis', this article explores how these media and policy discourses reinforce normative patterns of neoliberal citizen subjectivity by offering compelling pathways out of anxiety that re-route citizens' anxiety over child abuse in support of neoliberal modes of citizen subjectivity.",76
"Background: Pregnant victims of childhood maltreatment are more likely to deliver preterm. The mechanisms explaining this relationship are unclear. The goal of the current pilot study was to investigate whether momentary stress and cortisol serve as mechanisms linking maltreatment history to gestational length. Methods: Seventeen women enrolled in the study (35% maltreated). Women completed two study sessions at 27 and 34 weeks gestation. Following each session, at four times/day over two days, women reported their momentary stress levels by text message and provided corresponding salivary cortisol samples. Gestational length was determined by medical chart review. Results: Higher reports of momentary stress were associated with shortened gestational length. High stress predicted lower cortisol concentrations for women with maltreatment histories but higher concentrations among women without maltreatment. Conclusion: Results from this pilot study provide preliminary evidence for understanding mechanisms explaining increased risk for preterm birth among childhood maltreatment victims.",76
"Expanding on the concept of green building, sustainable development is being implemented across various infrastructure systems. Performance metrics and rating systems have been developed to measure the economic, social, and environmental impacts of the development process. The transportation sector has adapted with the development of sustainable rating systems, such as Greenroads, which focuses on roadway planning, design, and construction. Efforts to support more sustainable modes, such as pedestrian and cycling, have led to the development of new transportation rating systems, such as GreenPaths. The GreenPaths Rating System, developed as part of a previous research project, includes sustainable performance metrics related to the planning, location, design, construction, safety, and maintenance of shared-use pathways. This research builds on the development of the rating system and explores the feasibility of applying GreenPaths to various pathway development phases (existing, in development, and proposed). Therefore, the rating system is applied to three case study phases along the Buffalo Valley Rail Trail in Union County, PA. The results of the case study applications provide insight into the implementation process to three different development phases as well as an opportunity for rating system improvement. Results show that using the rating system earlier in the planning and design phase can lead to improvements in the integration of sustainable practices. The GreenPaths case studies serve as examples of how to implement the rating system for real-world pathway projects to support the development of sustainable transportation systems.",99
"This systematic review synthesised the literature on predictors, moderators, and mediators of outcome following Fairburn's CBT for eating disorders. Sixty-five articles were included. The relationship between individual variables and outcome was synthesised separately across diagnoses and treatment format. Early change was found to be a consistent mediator of better outcomes across all eating disorders. Moderators were mostly tested in binge eating disorder, and most moderators did not affect cognitive-behavioural treatment outcome relative to other treatments. No consistent predictors emerged. Findings suggest that it is unclear how and for whom this treatment works. More research testing mediators and moderators is needed, and variables selected for analyses need to be empirically and theoretically driven. Future recommendations include the need for authors to (i) interpret the clinical and statistical significance of findings; (ii) use a consistent definition of outcome so that studies can be directly compared; and (iii) report null and statistically significant findings.

"The prevalence of atopic dermatitis (AD) has increased substantially. Previous studies have focused mostly on pediatric patients, while epidemiological investigation on adult AD has been very limited. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and clinical features of adult AD in outpatients with dermatitis and eczema in China mainland. A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted among outpatients with eczema or dermatitis from 39 tertiary hospitals of 15 provinces in China from July 1 to September 30, 2014. Of 8758 patients, 407 were adult AD. Compared with adults with other types of dermatitis, the mean age (41.8 +/- 14.3 vs 42.04 +/- 15.38 years, P < 0.05) and onset age (35.2 +/- 11.2 vs 39.2 +/- 14.0 years, P < 0.001) of adult AD were younger, and mean disease duration was longer (5.3 +/- 7.1 vs 2.8 +/- 4.9 years, P < 0.001). About 53.3% adult AD involved 3 or more body locations, higher than adults with other types of dermatitis (34.4%, P < 0.001), but lower than those with pediatric and adolescent AD (73.8%, P < 0.001). History of asthma (19.2% vs 6.9%, P < 0.001) or allergic conjunctivitis (21.9% vs 14.9%, P < 0.05) was more common in adult AD than pediatric/ adolescent AD. Suspected bacterial infection was more frequently in adult AD than adults with other types of dermatitis (24.3% vs 14.6%, P < 0.001) and pediatric/ adolescent AD (24.3% vs 14.9%, P < 0.001). More severe itching was observed in 31.4% of adult AD, higher than that of adults with other types of dermatitis (15.4%, P0.05). The highest (8.7%) and lowest prevalence (3.7%) of adult AD were in 25 degrees N to 30 degrees N and 35 degrees N to 40 degrees N latitude region. A substantial part of adult outpatients with eczema or dermatitis is adult AD. Middle age, more body location involvement, more suspected bacterial infection, and severe itching are the main clinical feathers of adult AD. Geographical environment and economic situation work in synergy to adult AD.",110
"The authors investigated associations between young adults' perceived purposes of emerging adulthood and their attitudes toward and participation in cohabitation. In a sample of 775 never married individuals, ages 18-29 (69% female, 69% white) from the United States, young people's perceptions of this period of life were associated with their acceptance of cohabitation, their reasoning for accepting cohabitation, and the likelihood of cohabiting. Results showed that the perception that emerging adulthood is a time to prepare for future family roles was negatively associated with acceptance of cohabitation whereas the perception that emerging adulthood is a time to take risks was positively associated with acceptance of cohabitation. The perception that emerging adulthood is a time to prepare for future family roles was associated with an increased likelihood of having cohabited while the perception that emerging adulthood is a time of possibilities was associated with a decreased likelihood of having cohabited. Implications for future research are discussed.",77
"Single-molecule experimental methods have provided new insights into biomolecular function, dynamic disorder, and transient states that are all invisible to conventional measurements. A novel, nonfluorescent single-molecule technique involves attaching single molecules to single-walled carbon nanotube field-effective transistors (SWNT FETs). These ultrasensitive electronic devices provide long-duration, label-free monitoring of biomolecules and their dynamic motions. However, generalization of the SWNT FET technique first requires design rules that can predict the success and applicability of these devices. Here, we report on the transduction mechanism linking enzymatic processivity to electrical signal generation by a SWNT FET. The interaction between SWNT FETs and the enzyme lysozyme was systematically dissected using eight different lysozyme variants synthesized by protein engineering. The data prove that effective signal generation can be accomplished using a single charged amino acid, when appropriately located, providing a foundation to widely apply SWNT FET sensitivity to other biomolecular systems.",36
"With respect to automotive safety, the driver plays a crucial role. Stress level, tiredness, and distraction of the driver are therefore of high interest. In this paper, a driver state detection system based on cellular neural networks (CNNs) to monitor the driver's stress level is presented. We propose to include a capacitive-based wireless hand detection (position and touch) sensor for a steering wheel utilizing ink-jet printed sensor mats as an input sensor in order to improve the performance. A driving simulator platform providing a realistic virtual traffic environment is utilized to conduct a study with 22 participants for the evaluation of the proposed system. Each participant is driving in two different scenarios, each representing one of the two no-stress/stress driver states. A ""threefold"" cross validation is applied to evaluate our concept. The subject dependence is considered carefully by separating the training and testing data. Furthermore, the CNN approach is benchmarked against other state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. The results show a significant improvement combining sensor inputs from different driver inherent domains, giving a total related detection accuracy of 92%. Besides that, this paper shows that in case of including the capacitive hand detection sensor, the accuracy increases by 10%. These findings indicate that adding a subject-independent sensor, such as the proposed capacitive hand detection sensor, can significantly improve the detection performance.",1
"The neural processes giving rise tohumanmemorystrength signals remain poorly understood. Inspired by formal computational models that posit a central role of global matching in memory strength, we tested a novel hypothesis that the strengths of both true and false memories arise from the global similarity of an item's neural activation pattern during retrieval to that of all the studied items during encoding (i.e., the encoding-retrieval neural global pattern similarity [ER-nGPS]). We revealed multiple ER-nGPS signals that carried distinct information and contributed differentially to true and false memories: Whereas the ER-nGPS in the parietal regions reflected semantic similarity and was scaled with the recognition strengths of both true and false memories, ER-nGPS in the visual cortex contributed solely to true memory. Moreover, ER-nGPS differences between the parietal and visual cortices were correlated with frontal monitoring processes. By combining computational and neuroimaging approaches, our results advance a mechanistic understanding of memory strength in recognition.",78
"Ontogenetic peculiarities of catecholaminergic regulation of three vitally important physiological processes are described: heart beating, respiration, and early somatomotor activity. They are subordinated to the autorhythmical regime and are submitted to modulating effects of noradrenergic and dopaminergic mechanisms. There are considered age-related changes of this effect whose peculiarity is polar changes of reactions in the process of their maturation from the predominantly excitatory reactions at early stages to the predominantly inhibitory ones.",75
"The rising number of newly insured young adults brought on by health care reform will soon increase demands on primary care physicians. Physicians will face more young adult patients, which presents an opportunity for more prevention-oriented care. In the present study, we evaluated whether brief observer reports of young adults' personality traits could predict which individuals would be at greater risk for poor health as they entered midlife. Following the cohort of 1,000 individuals from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (Moffitt, Caspi, Rutter, & Silva, 2001), we show that very brief measures of young adults' personalities predicted their midlife physical health across multiple domains (metabolic abnormalities, cardiorespiratory fitness, pulmonary function, periodontal disease, and systemic inflammation). Individuals scoring low on the traits of Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience went on to develop poorer health even after accounting for preexisting differences in education, socioeconomic status, smoking, obesity, self-reported health, medical conditions, and family medical history. Moreover, personality ratings from peer informants who knew participants well, and from a nurse and receptionist who had just met participants for the first time, predicted health decline from young adulthood to midlife despite striking differences in level of acquaintance. Personality effect sizes were on par with other well-established health risk factors such as socioeconomic status, smoking, and self-reported health. We discuss the potential utility of personality measurement to function as an inexpensive and accessible tool for health care professionals to personalize preventive medicine. Adding personality information to existing health care electronic infrastructures could also advance personality theory by generating opportunities to examine how personality processes influence doctor-patient communication, health service use, and patient outcomes.",63
"Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are managed by the 5 nations where they occur (Canada, Greenland/Denmark, Norway, Russia, United States) using discrete subpopulations. In Canada, polar bears are harvested throughout their range, and several subpopulations are managed by more than one jurisdiction; therefore, recent management focused on ensuring sustainable polar bear harvests. Consequently, the subpopulation from which harvested bears are removed and the geographic boundaries of that subpopulation must be correctly identified. However, boundaries of the Southern Hudson Bay (SH) subpopulation have not been verified using satellite radio-telemetry data. Sea ice duration has already declined in Hudson Bay and James Bay, and both the duration and distribution of sea ice are predicted to decline greatly in the next century; therefore, it is important to document current habitat use patterns to assess the potential impacts of climate change. We used a probabilistic approach to describe the utilization distribution for the SH subpopulation based on data from 1997-2003 from 26 adult female bears fitted with satellite collars and assessed whether the currently accepted boundaries represent the population utilization distribution. We conclude that the SH boundaries do reflect the current spatial distribution of adult female bears in this subpopulation. Our analysis provides a benchmark to compare to the future distribution and habitat use of this subpopulation in response to effects of climate change and identifies future research needs to investigate polar bear distribution in James Bay and in the area near the boundary between the SH and Western Hudson Bay management zones.",54
"The virtualization has been considered as one of core technologies in cloud computing to overcome low efficiency of resource utilization for physical machines by multiplexing operating systems and/or applications on physical servers in a form of virtual machine. However, efficient algorithm and policy are required in order to map virtual machines to physical machines dynamically and to support efficient consolidation or load balancing for virtual machines. In addition, when the server environment is configured with servers with heterogeneous capabilities, these allocation algorithm and mapping policy are essential for efficient server operations. In this paper, we introduce an efficient dynamic allocation algorithm for virtual machines in heterogeneous server environment that works based on more accurate resource allocation priority than previous methods. Our proposed algorithm provides efficient allocation of virtual machines based on this priority. The evaluation supports the efficiency of our algorithm both for consolidation and load balancing of virtual machines in heterogeneous server environment.",68
"The need to understand the control strategies utilized by humans in their everyday activity requires the measurement of several variables, which pertain to different aspects of the interaction with the environment. This work focuses on validation and uncertainty quantification of a sensor-fusion suite for the acquisition of biometric information that can be used for the estimation of the control strategy in a variety of everyday tasks. Specifically, the acquisition of biomechanical parameters such as those involving estimations of human ankle mechanical impedance is addressed. The sensor fusion suite that we devised consists of a centralized program that can synchronize and integrate the information coming from several transducers. In this work the system combines a set of two computer vision cameras. The cameras utilize a stereovision algorithm that transforms the markers acquired in Cartesian space with a model in the camera space. Furthermore, a biomechanical model of the human is integrated in the system for the reconstruction of the tracked movements in the joint space. The architecture of the systems allows for the integration of transducers beyond those implemented to date, including inertial measurement units, electromyography and pressure sensors. The system was able to capture the dynamics of an inverted pendulum on a cart mimicking human walking on a treadmill there the mechanical parameters of the ankles where estimated simulating a single stand phase.",0
"Background: The medium-to-long-term use of antimuscarinics alone or in combination with an a-blocker in men with an enlarged prostate is still controversial. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of medium-to-long-term use of tolterodine extended release (ER) with or without tamsulosin in patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and larger prostate size. Methods: Totally, 152 patients (age >= 50 years) with BPH, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) >= 12, quality-of-life (QoL) score >= 3, and total prostate volume >= 25 ml were enrolled in this study. The patients were randomized into four groups (n = 38 in each) to receive tolterodine ER placebo plus tamsulosin placebo, 0.2 mg tamsulosin plus tolterodine ER placebo, 4 mg tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin placebo, or tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin once daily for 24 weeks. IPSS (total, storage, and voiding subscales), QoL, maximum urinary flow rate (Q(max)), and postvoid residual volume (PVR) were collected at baseline, and at weeks 4, 12, and 24. Results: Compared with placebo, tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin significantly improved total IPSS (-7.15, -12.20, and -14.66 vs. -3.51, -5.78, and -7.23), storage IPSS (-3.56, -5.63, and -6.66 vs. -1.52, -1.21, and -2.43), voiding IPSS (-2.88, -5.10, and -6.48 vs. -1.52, -3.03, and -2.97), QoL (-1.21, -2.40, and -3.21 vs. -0.39, -1.41, and -1.60), Q(max) (2.21, 7.97, and 9.72 ml/s vs. 2.15, 2.44, and 2.73 ml/s), and PVR (-17.88, -26.97, and -27.89 ml vs. -12.03, -11.16, and -16.73 ml) at weeks 4, 12, and 24, respectively; the differences were all statistically significant (P0.05). However, a gradual increase in PVR (10.03, 10.41, and 12.89 ml) and more urinary AEs suggestive of urinary retention (11/38 vs. 4/38) were observed. Conclusion: Medium-to-long-term use of tolterodine ER plus tamsulosin should be recommended in patients with BPH and an enlarged prostate volume.",17
"Impairments in interpersonal relationships are a core feature of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Social cognition dysfunction, like false recognition of others' emotions and intentions, may lead to emotional disturbances, self-injury, and impulsive aggression behaviors in patients with BPD. This study explored the extent to which social cognition, including emotional recognition and theory of mind (ToM), can predict the ability of social awareness in patients with BPD. Emotion recognition tasks (matching emotional facial expressions to prosody), verbal and nonverbal theory of mind tasks, and the awareness of social inference test were assessed. Results of a stepwise multiple regression showed that the quality of the early parent-child relationship, anger prosody recognition, and ToM were significantly related to the ability to be aware of social interactions in the patients with BPD.",62
"Introduction: Cysticercosis is caused by Taenia solium cysticerci, which are located mainly in the central nervous system causing neurocysticercosis. In Venezuela, few epidemiological studies on this disease have been conducted. Objective: To determine the seroprevalence and risk factors for cysticercosis in two rural communities in Anzoategui state. Material and methods: We conducted a survey to collect data on possible risk factors and signs and symptoms of the disease, and we took 182 samples in two communities, Boqueron and Punto Lindo. Detection of IgG antibodies against T. solium cysticerci was performed by ELISA. Results: Seroprevalence in Boqueron was 3.3%; due to the low number of seropositives the statistical analysis was not possible. However, the three seropositive persons had knowledge of the disease, and a history of consumption of undercooked pork meat, and presence of headache. In Punto Lindo, seroprevalence was 28.9%. There were no significant differences by sex or age; however, we found more seropositives among individuals younger than 20 years. With regard to risk factors and signs and symptoms, significant associations were found with consumption of undercooked pork (OR=18; 95% CI: 5.78 to 55.9), headaches (OR=3.6; 95% CI: 1.15 to 11.4), seizures (OR=18.9; 95% CI: 2.15 to 166.5) and visual problems (OR=5.7; 95% CI: 2.13 to 15.34). Conclusions: The results showed low transmission of cysticercosis in Boqueron, and high in Punto Lindo, where the high prevalence in children suggests recent transmission.",127
"Conversion of mechanical forces, vibrations and sound which have energy in the range of milli- to tens of watts (also referred to as ""small kinetic energies"" in this paper) into electricity has received global attention owing to the potential in powering electronic devices. However, most of the small kinetic energy generators can only generate electric power below 1 mu W/cm(3). As a result, an energy storage device is required to accumulate the energy generated until it reaches a sufficient level. Herein, we report the exceptionally-high acoustoelectric conversion ability of randomly-orientated electrospun poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) nanofiber nonwoven webs. The optimized device under sound is able to generate peak voltage and current of 14.5 V and 28.5 mu A with a volume power density output of 306.5 mu W/cm(3) (5.9 mW/cm(3) based on nanofiber web thickness). Without accumulation in any energy storage unit, the electricity generated by the nanofiber device is sufficient to light up tens of commercial LEDs, run electrochemical reactions and protect metals from corrosion. Such a novel acoustoelectric generator may offer an effective solution to recycling noise pollution into usable electricity.",43
"The dual source multi-functional heat pump (DMHP) system, which can adopt air source and solar energy to provide air conditioning and domestic water for building all the year round, is the integration of solar thermal collecting system and multi-functional heat pump system. This paper presents an investigation into the operation characteristics of the novel DMHP system under various working modes by theoretical and experimental methods. For each working mode, a dynamic model has been proposed and validated with the experimental data. With the verified model, the switch point between air source and solar energy can be identified by comparing the operation performance of different working modes under a range of boundary conditions. The results indicate that the performance of air source space heating mode is superior to that of solar space heating mode with the ambient temperature above 4 degrees C, and solar water heating mode is more efficient than air source water heating mode when the ambient temperature is below 3 degrees C. On this basis, annual performance of the system under different climate conditions reveals that the DMHP system can obtain relatively high COP with the optimal working strategy in the whole year especially for the district with cold winter. Furthermore, the exergy loss ratio in each component of the DMHP system has been discussed to provide the reference for further optimization. In general, the DMHP could be a promising building energy supply system with the advantage of high equipment utilization, compact structure, and full-featured, and this research would promote the development of such an innovative technology leading to significant energy saving and carbon emission reduction in building sector.

"Evolutionary biology is undergirded by an extensive and impressive set of mathematical models. Yet only one result, Fisher's theorem about selection and fitness, is generally accorded the status of a fundamental theorem. I argue that although its fundamental status is justified by its simplicity and scope, there are additional results that seem similarly fundamental. I suggest that the most fundamental theorem of evolution is the Price equation, both because of its simplicity and broad scope and because it can be used to derive four other familiar results that are similarly fundamental: Fisher's average-excess equation, Robertson's secondary theorem of natural selection, the breeder's equation, and Fisher's fundamental theorem. These derivations clarify both the relationships behind these results and their assumptions. Slightly less fundamental results include those for multivariate evolution and social selection. A key feature of fundamental theorems is that they have great simplicity and scope, which are often achieved by sacrificing perfect accuracy. Quantitative genetics has been more productive of fundamental theorems than population genetics, probably because its empirical focus on unknown genotypes freed it from the tyranny of detail and allowed it to focus on general issues.",34
"In this paper, we proposed a method that classifies electroencephalography (EEG) from color imagination data using the Emotiv EPOC headset. For EEG measurement and the event-related potential (ERP) method, brain-computer interface (BCI) systems were used in the experiment. In the experiment, the subjects gaze at a non-flicker visual stimulus of color (i.e., red, green, blue, white, and yellow) and then proceed to imagine the color. To concentrate on the LED light, all experiments were performed in a dimly lit room. The flickered visual stimulus was made using an Arduino microcontroller board and LEDs with the purpose of prompting color imagination. As a result, we obtained significant EEG responses of thoughts related to certain colors. The EEG response is classified using classification algorithms including a support vector machine (SVM) with linear discriminant analysis (LDA), an artificial neural network (ANN) with LDA, and an ANN without LDA. In addition, fivefold cross validation was used to evaluate the performance. From the results, we found robust electrodes (T7 and F4). The technology developed in this paper can be used to assist paralyzed individuals and the elderly. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.",51
"In recent years, green building (GB) has become the flagship of sustainable development, leading to a number of published works on the topic. This paper examines GB research trend in construction management (CM) through analyzing selected GB research papers published in 10 selected CM journals from 1990 to 2015 (as of end of August). The analysis is conducted in terms of the number of annual GB research publications, contributions made by various countries, institutions and authors, and research topics covered. The analysis reveals an increasing GB research interest in recent times, implying that the importance attached to GB by the construction industry is accelerating. The findings also indicate that during the studied period, researchers from developed economies such as the US, Hong Kong, the UK, Singapore, Italy, and Australia contributed most to promoting GB research. Developing countries such as China, Egypt, and Colombia also made good efforts to promote GB research. Research topics covered tend to focus on GB project delivery and developments, GB certifications, energy performance, and advanced technologies. Research gaps are discussed with directions for future research proposed. This study may Serve as a valuable platform for both industry practitioners and researchers to appreciate GB research trends and developments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",99
"BACKGROUND Sinusitis is a leading health care problem believed to be increasing in both incidence and prevalence. Various articles have been published on sinusitis and its treatment. However, its importance is diminished by the fact that sinusitis is variously defined. The main objective of this study is to define the clinical signs and symptoms of chronic bacterial sinusitis and to grade the severity of presentation of each clinical feature correlating with radiological and endoscopic and microbiological features. MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective study was conducted in a tertiary health care centre over a three-month period; 80 patients were chosen, 40 with nasal symptoms as their main complaint with or without headache as experimental group and 40 patients with headache as their main complaint without nasal symptoms as the control group. They were subjected to detailed clinical examination, radiological, endoscopic and microbiological examinations. RESULTS Nasal obstruction, discharge and headache form the major symptoms while hyperaemia, deviated septum with hypertrophied inferior turbinates form the major signs in the case group. Diagnostic nasal endoscopy correlated well with clinical findings, while x-ray of the sinuses was found to be abnormal in all cases. CONCLUSION A proper and detailed clinical evaluation with x-ray of the paranasal sinuses and endoscopy should form the mainstay in diagnosing chronic bacterial sinusitis. CT scan should be added if we are planning for surgery and for cases not responding to initial medical management due to radiological risk and cause factor.",127
"Canine brucellosis caused by Brucella canis is a neglected zoonosis worldwide and is a leading cause of reproductive failure in dogs, often causing substantial economic losses in breeding kennels. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of B.canis infection in dogs of commercial breeding kennels located in SAo Paulo State, Brazil. A total of 753 dogs (183 males and 570 females) from 38 commercial kennels were clinically examined, and blood samples were collected for brucellosis diagnosis through blood culture. The association between clinical manifestations suggestive of brucellosis and positive results through blood culture was determined. Of the 753 dogs tested, 166 (22.0%) had at least one clinical sign suggestive of brucellosis and 158 (20.9%) had positive blood cultures. Seventy-two dogs had positive blood culture and had at least one clinical sign suggestive of brucellosis, while 91 dogs showed at least one clinical manifestation suggestive of brucellosis although blood culture was negative. Of the 38 kennels, 16 (42.1%) had at least one positive dog. The prevalence of infection in each kennel varied from 3.8% to 62.6%. Abortion/stillbirth, failure to conceive and enlargement of lymph nodes were significantly associated with brucellosis in female. No association of clinical signs and positive results in blood culture was observed in males. None of the kennels has been carrying out programmes to control brucellosis, and the sale of infected dogs was considered a common practice yielding risks to the public health, in view of the zoonotic potential of the infection.",37
"Raw signal simulation is a useful tool for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system design, mission planning, processing algorithm testing, and inversion algorithm design. Time and frequency synchronization is the key technique of bistatic SAR (BiSAR) system, and raw data simulation is an effective tool for verifying the time and frequency synchronization techniques. According to the two-dimensional (2-D) frequency spectrum of fixed-receiver BiSAR, a rapid raw data simulation approach with time and frequency synchronization errors is proposed in this paper. Through 2-D inverse Stolt transform in 2-D frequency domain and phase compensation in range-Doppler frequency domain, this method can significantly improve the efficiency of scene raw data simulation. Simulation results of point targets and extended scene are presented to validate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed simulation approach.",35
"Background: The increasing use of computers in science allows for the scientific analyses of large datasets at an increasing pace. We provided examples and interactive demonstrations at Dundee Science Centre as part of the 2015 Women in Science festival, to present aspects of computational science to the general public. We used low-cost Raspberry Pi computers to provide hands on experience in computer programming and demonstrated the application of computers to biology. Computer games were used as a means to introduce computers to younger visitors. The success of the event was evaluated by voluntary feedback forms completed by visitors, in conjunction with our own self-evaluation. This work builds on the original work of the 4273 pi bioinformatics education program of Barker et al. (2013, BMC Bioinform. 14: 243). 4273 pi provides open source education materials in bioinformatics. This work looks at the potential to adapt similar materials for public engagement events. Results: It appears, at least in our small sample of visitors (n = 13), that basic computational science can be conveyed to people of all ages by means of interactive demonstrations. Children as young as five were able to successfully edit simple computer programs with supervision. This was, in many cases, their first experience of computer programming. The feedback is predominantly positive, showing strong support for improving computational science education, but also included suggestions for improvement. Conclusions: Our conclusions are necessarily preliminary. However, feedback forms suggest methods were generally well received among the participants; ""Easy to follow. Clear explanation"" and ""Very easy. Demonstrators were very informative."" Our event, held at a local Science Centre in Dundee, demonstrates that computer games and programming activities suitable for young children can be performed alongside a more specialised and applied introduction to computational science for older visitors.",40
"A new normalized least mean square (NLMS)-based identification algorithm is proposed for sparse systems. In the proposed algorithm, a tap-selection matrix is utilized to adaptively locate the nonzero coefficients during the convergence process. The so-called tap-selection matrix is a diagonal matrix consisting of zeros and ones, with ones indicating the locations of the active coefficients. At each iteration, tap weights update based on the product of the tap-selection matrix and previous tap-weight vector in the NLMS style. The tap-selection matrix updates by comparing each tap weight with a pre-determined threshold value. Parameter choice guidelines for the threshold value are provided to facilitate practical use. Steady-state mean square deviation is also analyzed for performance evaluation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed NLMS algorithm with tap-selection matrix can effectively locate the nonzero coefficients of the unknown system impulse response, outperforming the existing NLMS-based algorithms for sparse system identifications.",49
"The presence of traffic on a slender long-span bridge deck will modify the cross-section profile of the bridge, which may influence the flutter derivatives and in turn, the critical flutter wind velocity of the bridge. Studies on the influence of vehicles on the flutter derivatives and the critical flutter wind velocity of bridges are rather rare as compared to the investigations on the coupled buffeting vibration of the wind-vehicle-bridge system. A typical streamlined cross-section for long-span bridges is adopted for both experimental and analytical studies. The scaled bridge section model with vehicle models distributed on the bridge deck considering different traffic flow scenarios has been tested in the wind tunnel. The flutter derivatives of the modified bridge cross section have been identified using forced vibration method and the results suggest that the influence of vehicles on the flutter derivatives of the typical streamlined cross-section cannot be ignored. Based on the identified flutter derivatives, the influence of vehicles on the flutter stability of the bridge is investigated. The results show that the effect of vehicles on the flutter wind velocity is obvious.",97
"Background: Solifenacin, an effective, well-tolerated treatment for adult overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms, has not been evaluated in placebo-controlled paediatric clinical trials. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily oral solifenacin suspension in OAB patients aged 5-< 12 yr (children) and 12-= 3 wk at the optimum dose before end of treatment (EoT). Outcome measurements and statistics: Superiority of solifenacin versus placebo in change frombaseline to EoT for mean volume voided/micturition (MVV, primary endpoint); daytime maximumvolume voided/micturition (DMaxVV); incontinence episodes (mean/24 h); mean number of incontinence-free days or nights/7 d; micturition frequency; and Micturition frequency adjusted for baseline total voided volume (VTB) as an exploratory parameter). Efficacy parameters were analysed using analysis of covariance. Safety parameters (treatment- emergent adverse events, serious adverse events, laboratory variables, vital signs, electrocardiogram, postvoid residual volume) are summarised using descriptive statistics. Results and limitations: In children, solifenacin was superior to placebo in terms of the change from baseline to EoT for MVV (solifenacin-placebo difference 12.1 ml, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.2-24.0; p = 0.046), DMaxVV (difference in adjusted mean change from baseline for solifenacin-placebo 31.9 ml, 95% CI 4.3-59.5; p = 0.024), VTB-adjusted micturition frequency (p = 0.028). Other endpoints were not significantly different. Solifenacin was well tolerated. For adolescents, it was not possible to draw firm efficacy conclusions because of the low numbers recruited. Conclusions: Once-daily solifenacin oral suspension in children with OAB was superior to placebo for MVV (primary efficacy endpoint) and was well tolerated. Patient summary: In this 12-wk study, a once-daily oral suspension of solifenacin in children aged 5-< 12 yr with overactive bladder was superior to placebo in increasing mean volume voided/micturition, the primary efficacy variable in the study. Solifenacin was well tolerated, with a low incidence of dry mouth and constipation. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT01565707. (C) 2016 European Association of Urology.

"Granulomatous dermatitis has been associated with hematologic disorders, including the myelodysplastic syndromes. We describe the first case of granulomatous dermatitis associated with polycythemia vera, presenting as large erythematous nodules mimicking panniculitis. We also present the seventh case associated with myelodysplasia, with erythematous plaques on the face and neck, similar to a neutrophilic dermatosis. We consider it particularly interesting for dermatologists to be aware of this dermatosis as a nonspecific manifestation of various hematologic disorders. We suggest performing additional tests ( complete blood count) to exclude the possibility that the skin manifestations are the initial sign of hematologic disease. Furthermore, we propose using the broader term, granulomatous dermatitis, to refer to these disorders as, although there are more reports of interstitial forms, cases with a more nodular presentation have also been published, and the importance of the diagnosis derives not from the subtype but from the relationship with an underlying disease.

"This paper includes country level virtual water data in an Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) for water pollution. Virtual water accounts for the total amount of water required to produce a good in all stages of production. This paper constructs a water independence index, defined as the water required in domestic production divided by the amount of water required for all imported goods. Results suggest an increase in trade openness and importing water intensive goods may lower water pollution levels.",96
"AimThe burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is growing rapidly around the world. However, there is limited information on the overall regional prevalence of CKD, as well as the prognostic implications and treatment patterns in Asian region. We have established the Asian Renal Collaboration (ARC) with the goal of consolidating region-wide data regarding CKD. MethodsThis collaborative project will synthesize data and perform meta-analyses of observational studies conducted in Asia. Studies will be identified through a systematic literature search including abstracts, proceedings of meetings, electronic databases such as MEDLINE and EMBASE. Personal enquiry among collaborators and experts in the region will identify additional studies, or other data sources such as registries. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that describe the prevalence of CKD and its complications will be included, as will longitudinal studies that describe important clinical outcomes for people with CKD. Individual participant data will be sought, where possible, from each of the studies included in the collaboration for baseline parameters and subsequent outcomes, in order to maximize flexibility and consistency of data analyses. ConclusionsThis study is an initiative offering a unique opportunity to obtain information about the prevalence and manifestations of CKD in Asia, as well as its risk factors. The ARC will also provide insights into important outcomes including progression of CKD, CKD complications, cardiovascular disease and death. These findings will improve our understanding of kidney disease in Asia, and thus help inform service provision, preventive care and further research across the region.",129
"Caffeine is neuroprotective in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD) and caffeine intake is inversely associated with the risk of PD. This association may be influenced by the genotype of GRIN2A, which encodes an NMDAglutamate-receptor subunit. In two placebo-controlled studies, we detected no association of caffeine intake with the rate of clinical progression of PD, except among subjects taking creatine, for whom higher caffeine intake was associated with more rapid progression. We now have analyzed data from 420 subjects for whom DNA samples and caffeine intake data were available from a placebo-controlled study of creatine in PD. The GRIN2A genotype was not associated with the rate of clinical progression of PD in the placebo group. However, there was a 4-way interaction between GRIN2A genotype, caffeine, creatine and the time since baseline. Among subjects in the creatine group with high levels of caffeine intake, but not among those with low caffeine intake, the GRIN2A T allele was associated with more rapid progression (p = 0.03). These data indicate that the deleterious interaction between caffeine and creatine with respect to rate of progression of PD is influenced by GRIN2A genotype. This example of a genetic factor interacting with environmental factors illustrates the complexity of gene-environment interactions in the progression of PD. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

"The coupling between unsteady heat release and acoustic perturbations can lead to self-sustained thermoacoustic oscillations, also known as combustion instability. When such combustion instability occurs, the pressure oscillations may become so intense that they can cause engine structural damage and costly mission failure. Thus there is a need to develop a real-time monitoring and control approach, which enables engine systems to be operated stably. In this work, an online monitoring and optimization algorithm is developed to stabilize unstable thermoacoustic systems, which are characterized by nonlinear limit cycle oscillations. It is based on least mean square method (LMS), The performance of the optimization algorithm is evaluated first on a Van der Pol oscillator. It can produce nonlinear limit cycle oscillations, which is similar to pressure oscillation as frequently observed in gas turbine engines. It is shown that implementing the control strategy leads to the oscillations quickly decayed. To further validate the control strategy, experimental study is conducted on a Rijke tube. It is found that approximately 45 dB sound pressure reduction is achieved by actuating a loudspeaker. In addition, the control approach is demonstrated to be able to track and prevent the onset of new limit cycle thermoacoustic oscillations resulting from the changes of fuel flow rate. The present work opens up a new applicable approach to stabilize engine system in terms of minimizing thermoacoustic oscillations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",49
"Both mobile phone communication and the genre of sex advice writing are often criticized, the former as unkind and the latter as sexist. Yet some research indicates that digitally mediated communication may have some advantages, particularly when disinhibition might confer benefits such as personal expression or resisting coercion and sexual harassment. This paper investigates whether consent is discussed differently in popular online sexting tips articles as compared with a similar set of general sex advice articles. I find that while general sex tips infrequently address consent and offer communication as an optional practice, sexting tips stress the importance of consent more often and warn sexters about the potential harm an unwanted sext might cause to a recipient. I suggest that this may be due to the particular affordances of mobile phone communication, including lack of physical proximity, asynchronicity, and the reduction of unconscious nonverbal communication. Because this discourse about consent appears in a popular format, it may have the potential to serve as a model for a broader cultural shift towards the normalization of explicit communication about consent for all sexual acts.",64
"The objective of this work is to understand the use of crack in women, their life stories and clinical characteristics from a gender perspective. This is a case study of qualitative character. The participant Maria, a pregnant crack user, was in hospital. Her story was permeated by violence, vulnerabilities and family difficulties. Through the instruments (semi-structured interviews and clinical and Cognitive Screening), revealed a preserved cognitive functions, generalized anxiety disorder, episode (hypo) maniac past, and antisocial personality disorder. Prejudice made the access to treatment difficult, requiring social character interventions, with specific treatments for women who use crack.",73
"In order to reduce the security risk of commercial aircraft, passengers are not allowed to take certain items in their carry-on baggage. For this reason, human operators are trained to detect prohibited items using a manually-controlled baggage screening process. In this paper, the use of an automated method based on multiple X-ray views is proposed to recognise certain regular objects with highly-defined shapes and sizes. The method consists of two steps: 'monocular analysis', to obtain possible detections in each view of a sequence, and 'multiple view analysis', to recognise the objects of interest using matching in all views. The search for matching candidates is efficiently performed using a look-up table that is computed offline. In order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experimental results on recognising regular objects (clips, springs and razor blades) in pencil cases are shown achieving high precision and recall (P-r = 95.7%, R-e = 92.5%) for 120 objects. We believe that it would be possible to design an automated aid in a target detection task using the proposed algorithm.",0
"We previously reported that women with short sleep duration consumed more dietary carbohydrate and showed an increased risk for obesity compared to those who slept adequately, but not for men. Using a cross-sectional study of 17,841 Korean women, we investigated the influence of sleep duration on obesity-related variables and consumption of dietary carbohydrate-rich foods in relation to menopausal status. Premenopausal women with short sleep duration had significantly greater body weight (p = 0.007), body mass index (p = 0.003), systolic and diastolic blood pressures (p = 0.028 and p = 0.024, respectively), prevalence of obesity (p < 0.016), and consumption of more carbohydrate-rich foods such as staple foods (p = 0.026) and simple sugar-rich foods (p = 0.044) than those with adequate sleep duration after adjustment for covariates. Premenopausal women with short sleep duration were more obese by 1.171 times compared to subjects adequate sleep duration (95% confidence interval = 1.030-1.330). However, obesity-related variables, dietary consumption, and odds of being obese did not differ according to sleep duration for postmenopausal women. The findings suggest that the increased risk for obesity and consumption of dietary carbohydrate-rich foods with short sleep duration appeared to disappear after menopause in Korean women.",9
"Sucrose induces the expression of miR398 and the production of miR398 is controlled by SQUAMOSA promoter binding protein-like7 (SPL7) transcription factor under copper deficiency in Arabidopsis thaliana. Little else, however, is known about the sucrose-regulated copper homeostasis in Arabidopsis. Here, we employed the microarray technology to screen for sucrose-responsive microRNAs (miRNAs), and identified several candidates using northern blotting. In addition to miR398, miR408, miR319, and miR160 are also responsive to sucrose. Furthermore, the induction of miR398 and miR408 by sucrose depends on the presence of SPL7. MiR398 and miR408 induction by high sucrose was eliminated by high copper. Meanwhile, high sucrose treatment strongly suppressed copper accumulation. Knock-down of SPL7 dramatically reduced copper accumulation in plants under low sucrose, but this effect was corn promised in the presence of high levels of sucrose. Taken together, these results suggest a connection between sucrose signaling and copper accumulation in cells, and that sucrose-regulated copper accumulation is both SPL7-dependent and SPL7-independent in Arabidopsis.

"Discrepancies among independent sources of information about presumably identical constructs argue against reliance on a single perspective. To fill the need for temperament questionnaires for teacher and parent informants, we adapted the popular parent/caregiver Child Behavior Questionnaire-Short Form for preschool and kindergarten teachers. Informant correspondences were low as expected, but patterns were consistent with hypotheses drawn from person perception models. Internal consistencies of the teacher scales were adequate, comparing favorably with those of parent-rated scales. Anticipated relations of temperament scales emerged with social competence and tasks of executive attention for both parent and teacher informants. Confirmatory factor analyses conducted separately for parent and teacher scales supported the familiar three-factor model when allowances were made for cross-loadings and correlated errors. A multigroup confirmatory factor analyses with parent and teacher data indicated that the factor structures of the two questionnaires are similar but not equivalent.",63
"We introduce NetworKit, an open-source software package for analyzing the structure of large complex networks. Appropriate algorithmic solutions are required to handle increasingly common large graph data sets containing up to billions of connections. We describe the methodology applied to develop scalable solutions to network analysis problems, including techniques like parallelization, heuristics for computationally expensive problems, efficient data structures, and modular software architecture. Our goal for the software is to package results of our algorithm engineering efforts and put them into the hands of domain experts. NetworKit is implemented as a hybrid combining the kernels written in C++ with a Python frontend, enabling integration into the Python ecosystem of tested tools for data analysis and scientific computing. The package provides a wide range of functionality (including common and novel analytics algorithms and graph generators) and does so via a convenient interface. In an experimental comparison with related software, NetworKit shows the best performance on a range of typical analysis tasks.",41
"Recent work has suggested the presence of a variety of motives and mechanisms that affect young children's sharing decisions. Yet, little is known about the relative impact of these motives. In three experiments with 3- to 6-year-old children (total N=140), the current study contrasts two important recipient characteristics that have been suggested to play a major role in early sharing; the positive social relationship between children and recipients and the differences in recipients' wealth. To this end, children could allocate resources to a friend who already possessed a lot of them and to a nonfriend (Experiments 1 and 2) or a stranger (Experiment 3) who owned only very few resources. Across age, children showed a preference to share more with their rich friend, although this tendency was stronger in the older preschool children. The findings are discussed with respect to theoretical accounts on the psychological basis of early sharing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",65
"Local scour around seabed oil, gas or water pipelines can critically affect their stability. Accurate estimation of scour around pipelines is therefore a key topic of research for marine engineers. This paper presents results from a numerical study of clear-water scour depth below a submarine pipeline for a range of steady flow conditions. The flow field around a pipeline under scour equilibrium conditions was numerically simulated by solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the standard k-epsilon turbulence closure. The flow discharge through the scour hole for various flow conditions was then investigated, and the results were used to establish the relationship between the flow discharge and the maximum scour depth. By incorporating the Colebrook-White equation, the bed shear stress was obtained and an iterative method was developed to predict the scour depth around the pipeline. The calculated scour depths using the proposed method agreed well with laboratory measurements, with the average absolute relative error being smaller than that obtained by using previous methods. Therefore, this proposed method can be used to predict the clear-water scour around submarine pipelines with improved accuracy.",83
"Objective. We estimated the proportion of U.S. smokers who have low socioeconomic status (SES). Methods. We used 2012 data from a national supplement to The Attitudes and Behaviors Survey on Health (TABS), a periodic population survey of Colorado adults. We estimated smoking prevalence and total smokers by education, poverty level, occupation, health insurance status, and combinations of these factors. Results. Smoking prevalence across low-SES categories ranged from 24.3% to 42.6%. Combining low-SES categories with the highest smoking prevalence accounted for 31.1% of U.S. adults but half (50.1%) of smokers. Combining all low-SES categories regardless of smoking prevalence accounted for roughly half (53.3%) of adults but nearly three-fourths (72.2%) of smokers. Conclusions. A majority of continuing U.S. smokers have low SES. Further progress against the U.S. cigarette epidemic depends on focusing tobacco research and program initiatives on reaching and engaging these smokers in cessation strategies that work for them.",26
"An arrangement is proposed for a four-stroke internal combustion engine to: (a) recover thermal energy from products of combustion during the exhaust stroke; (b) store that energy as sensible heat in a micro-channel regenerator matrix; and (c) transfer the stored heat to compressed fresh charge that flows through the regenerator during the succeeding mechanical cycle. An extra moveable piston that can be locked at preferred positions and a sequence of valve events enable the regenerator to lose heat to the working fluid during one interval of time but gain heat from the fluid during another interval of time. This paper examines whether or not this scheme for in-cylinder regeneration (ICR) improves the cycle thermal efficiency eta(1). Models for various thermodynamic processes in the cycle and treatments for unsteady compressible flow and heat transfer inside the regenerator are developed. Digital simulations of the cycle are made. Compared to an idealized engine cycle devoid of regeneration, provisions for ICR seem to deteriorate the thermal efficiency. In an 8:1 compression ratio octane engine simulated with an equivalence ratio of 0.75, eta(1) = 0.455 with regeneration and eta(1) = 0.491 without. This study shows that previous claims on efficiency gains via ICR, using highly-simplified models, may be misleading. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",87
"BACKGROUND: While eating disorders (EDs) are thought to result from a combination of environmental and psychological stressors superimposed on genetic vulnerability, the neurobiological basis of EDs remains incompletely understood. We recently reported that a rare missense mutation in the gene for the transcriptional repressor histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) is associated with the risk of developing an ED in humans. METHODS: To understand the biological consequences of this missense mutation, we created transgenic mice carrying this mutation by introducing the alanine to threonine mutation at position 778 of mouse Hdac4 (corresponding to position 786 of the human protein). Bioinformatic analysis to identify Hdac4-regulated genes was performed using available databases. RESULTS: Male mice heterozygous for HDAC4(A778T) did not show any metabolic or behavioral differences. In contrast, female mice heterozygous for HDAC4(A778T) display several ED-related feeding and behavioral deficits depending on housing condition. Individually housed HDAC4(A778T) female mice exhibit reduced effortful responding for high-fat diet and compulsive grooming, whereas group-housed female mice display increased weight gain on high-fat diet, reduced behavioral despair, and increased anxiety-like behaviors. Bioinformatic analysis identifies mitochondrial biogenesis including synthesis of glutamate/gamma-aminobutyric acid as a potential transcriptional target of HDAC4(A778T) activity relevant to the behavioral deficits identified in this new mouse model of disordered eating. CONCLUSIONS: The HDAC4(A778T) mouse line is a novel model of ED-related behaviors and identifies mitochondrial biogenesis as a potential molecular pathway contributing to behavioral deficits.",67
"OBJECTIVES: Orbital surgery is a challenging procedure because of its complex anatomy. Training could especially benefit from dedicated study models. The currently available devices lack sufficient anatomical representation and realistic soft tissue properties. Hence, we developed a 3D-printed simulation device for orbital surgery with tactual (haptic) correct simulation of all relevant anatomical structures. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Based on computed tomography scans collected from patients treated in a third referral center, the hard and soft tissue were segmented and virtually processed to generate a 3D-model of the orbit. Hard tissue was then physically realized by 3D printing. The soft tissue was manufactured by a composite silicone model of the nucleus and the surrounding tissue over a negative mold model also generated by 3D-printing. The final model was evaluated by a group of 5 trainees in oral and maxillofacial surgery (1) and a group of 5 consultants (2). All participants were asked to reconstruct an isolated orbital floor defect with a titanium implant. A stereotactic navigation system was available to all participants. Their experience was evaluated for haptic realism, correct representation of surgical approach, general handling of model, insertion of implant into the orbit, placement and fixation of implant, and usability of navigated control. The items were evaluated via nonparametric statistics (1 [poor]-5 [good]). RESULTS: Group 1 gave an average mark of 4.0 (+/- 0.9) versus 4.6 (+/- 0.6) by group 2. The haptics were rated as 3.6 (+/- 1.1) [1] and 4.2 (+/- 0.8) [2]. The surgical approach was graded 3.7 (+/- 1.2) [1] and 4.0 (+/- 1.0) [2]. Handling of the models was rated 3.5 (+/- 1.1) [1] and 4 (+/- 0.7) [2]. The insertion of the implants was marked as 3.7 (+/- 0.8) [1] and 4.2 (+/- 0.8) [2]. Fixation of the implants was also perceived to be,realistic with 3.6 (+/- 0.9) [1] and 4.2 (+/- 0.45) [2]. Lastly, surgical navigation was rated 3.8 (+/- 0.8) [1] and 4.6 (+/- 0.56) [2]. CONCLUSION: In this project, all relevant hard and soft tissue characteristics of orbital anatomy could be realized. Moreover, it was possible to demonstrate that the entire workflow of an orbital procedure may be simulated. Hence, using this model training expenses may be reduced and patient security could be enhanced. ((C) 2016 Association of Program Directors in Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The rationale of our approach consists in properly distributing the large data volumes and the processing tasks involved in the P-SBAS chain among the available (virtual and/or physical) computing nodes of the CC infrastructure, so that each one of these elements can concurrentlywork on data that are physically stored on its own local volume. To do this, both an ad hocmanagement of the data flow and an appropriate scheduling of the parallel jobs have been also implemented to properly handle the high complexity of the P-SBAS workflow. The proposed solution allows minimizing the overall data transfer and network load, thus improving the P-SBAS efficiency and scalability within the exploited CCenvironments. The presented P-SBAS implementation has been extensively validated through two experimental analyses, which have been carried out by exploiting the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) resources. The former analysis involves the processing of a large (128 SAR images) COSMO-SkyMed dataset, which has been performed by exploiting up to 64 computing nodes, and is aimed at demonstrating the P-SBAS scalable performances. The latter allows us to show the P-SBAS capability to generate DInSAR results at a regional scale (150 000 km2 in Southern California) in a very short time (about 9 h), by simultaneously processing 18 ENVISAT frames that correspond to a total of 741 SAR images, exploiting in parallel 144 AWS computing nodes. The presented results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed P-SBASCCsolution, whichmay contribute to further extend the frontiers of the DInSAR investigation at a very large scale.",2
"In 1915, the California Commission of Immigration and Housing (CCIH) unveiled a bold new experiment: the Home Teacher Program. In Los Angeles, this program sent volunteers into Mexican communities to teach immigrant women new, more ""American"" ways of homemaking and childrearing. The lesson plans, sample dialogues, teacher testimonies, and photographs featured in CCIH publications provide a fascinating window on to the tense interactions between home teachers and immigrant women. Scholars have long explored different ways of mining institutional records and other forms of writing by Americanization advocates for insights into the experiences of those who participated in the programs. This essay contributes to the discussion of California's Americanization curricula in two ways: First, I provide a close reading of CCIH texts in order to uncover and analyze three layers of recorded experience: (1) teacher biases confronted by immigrant women; (2) immigrant women's difficult material realities; and (3) immigrant women's complex responses to Americanization. Second, I provide further evidence for the view that Mexican immigrant women responded to Americanization efforts in a variety of ways, from outright resistance to milder forms of pushback and, at times, conditional acceptance of the ""American"" customs presented to them. In light of the evidence, I argue that Mexican immigrant women were ""doing the impossible"" by laying claim to a piece of California through the complex relationship they negotiated with the home teachers. Although Americanization programs intended to flatten Mexican women's ethnic affiliations, the immigrant women found subtle ways to assert their agency, survive hardship and prejudice, and forge a new Mexican American ethnic community in the process.",61
"Background and aims: The incidence of menstrual symptoms is reported to be as high as 90% in cyclic women. These symptoms, including anxiety and pain, might be associated with cortisol, as its receptors are widely distributed in the brain areas associated with behavior. Therefore, the current study aimed to assess the cortisol awakening response (CAR) throughout the menstrual cycle and correlate it with pain perception and trait anxiety. Materials and methods: CAR was assessed by measuring salivary cortisol at 0, 15, 30, and 60 min following awakening in the same women (n = 59, age 22.2 +/- 0.37 years) at various stages of the menstrual cycle (menses, midcycle, luteal and premenstrual phases). Progesterone and estradiol concentrations were also determined in saliva samples to assess cyclic changes. Self-reported pain, trait anxiety, and menstrual symptoms were assessed by visual analog scale (VAS), state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI-T), and the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP), respectively. Results: Estradiol was significantly elevated during the midcycle period and remained high during the early luteal phase (p < 0.05). Progesterone was increased during the luteal phase (p < 0.05). Post awakening cortisol values increased during midcycle, luteal phase, and premenstrual phase (p0.05, blunted or flat CAR). Positive and significant correlations were found between cortisol and estradiol (R-2 = 0.322; p = 0.000), cortisol and progesterone (R-2 = 0.156; p = 0.000), and estradiol and progesterone (R-2 = 0.349; p = 0.001). Premenstrual symptom scores were higher in the menses and premenstrual phases than in the midcycle and luteal phases (p < 0.001). Pain perception was the highest during the menses followed by the premenstrual phase (p < 0.01). Conclusions: CAR was blunted during the menses, suggesting that cortisol might play a phase-specific role in the regulation of the cycle. Additionally, premenstrual symptoms, including pain, were more severe when ovarian steroid levels reduced (i.e., menses and the premenstrual phase). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",4
"It is uncertain whether subjects with mild knee osteoarthritis, and who may be at risk of osteoporosis, can exercise safely with the aim of improving hip bone strength. This RCT showed that participating in a high-impact exercise program improved femoral neck strength without any detrimental effects on knee cartilage composition. No previous studies have examined whether high-impact exercise can improve bone strength and articular cartilage quality in subjects with mild knee osteoarthritis. In this 12-month RCT, we assessed the effects of progressive high-impact exercise on femoral neck structural strength and biochemical composition of knee cartilage in postmenopausal women. Eighty postmenopausal women with mild knee radiographic osteoarthritis were randomly assigned into the exercise (n = 40) or control (n = 40) group. Femoral neck structural strength was assessed with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The knee cartilage region exposed to exercise loading was measured by the quantitative MRI techniques of T2 mapping and delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI of cartilage (dGEMRIC). Also, an accelerometer-based body movement monitor was used to evaluate the total physical activity loading on the changes of femoral neck strength in all participants. Training effects on the outcome variables were estimated by the bootstrap analysis of covariance. A significant between-group difference in femoral neck bending strength in favor of the trainees was observed after the 12-month intervention (4.4%, p < 0.01). The change in femoral neck bending strength remained significant after adjusting for baseline value, age, height, and body mass (4.0%, p = 0.020). In all participants, the change in bending strength was associated with the total physical activity loading (r = 0.29, p = 0.012). The exercise participation had no effect on knee cartilage composition. The high-impact training increased femoral neck strength without having any harmful effect on knee cartilage in women with mild knee osteoarthritis. These findings imply that progressive high-impact exercise is a feasible method in seeking to prevent hip fractures in postmenopausal women whose articular cartilage may also be frail.",9
"Mathematics education in contemporary elementary schools is mainly conducted in a conventional way by giving lectures. A teacher would pass on knowledge to students by giving lectures, and this type of one-way teaching method is prone to cause poor learning achievement. Many researchers have suggested the use of a collaborative problem solving to improve the situation. This research proposed the use of a digital pen learning system (DPLS) with collaborative problem solving to improve learning achievement and learning motivation in a conventional mathematics courses. A quasi-experimental design was adopted to set up all of the teaching activities, which involved 64 fourth-grade students for four weeks. The results of the research show that the learning achievement of the two experimental groups was significantly better than control group. There was no significant difference between the two experimental groups and control group in terms of learning motivation. There was no significant difference between the three groups in terms of learning attitude. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",81
"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) inhibitors are increasingly being used in inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD). The risk of cardiovascular disease is elevated in patients with IRD and TNF- inhibitors reduce this risk. We assessed whether the beneficial effect of TNF- inhibitors on cardiovascular risk is mediated by blood pressure reduction. We measured blood pressure levels with 24-h ambulatory blood pressure measurements device in patients with IRD before and 3 months after treatment with TNF- inhibitors. The study population consisted of 15 subjects (6 men; mean age 45.9 +/- 14.1 years). Most patients had either rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis and adalimumab was the most common TNF- inhibitor used. Mean 24-h systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels remained the same after treatment (121 +/- 12/66 +/- 7 before and 123 +/- 11/67 +/- 10mm Hg after; p=0.88 and 0.66, respectively). The study demonstrates that TNF- inhibitors have no effect on blood pressure levels.",107
"This paper proposes technique for mitigating an issue of ""reduced signal voltage range"" in existing analog signal processing circuits in finer technologies due to their low supply voltage. The proposed adaptively-biased MOSFET pair can make an MOSFET operate in the saturation or the triode region in a wider voltage range.

"In the fast developing world of today, automatic generation control (AGC) plays an incredibly significant role in offering inevident demand of good quality power supply in power system. To deliver a quality power, AGC system requires an efficient and intelligent control algorithm. Hence, in this paper, a novel fractional order fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative (FOFPID) controller is proposed for AGC of electric power generating systems. The proposed controller is tested for the first time on three structures of multi area multi-source AGC system. The gains and fractional order parameters such as order of integrator (lambda) and differentiator (mu and gamma) of FOFPID controller are optimized using bacterial foraging optimization algorithm (BFOA). Initially, the proposed controller is implemented on a traditional two-area multi-source hydrothermal power system and its effectiveness is established by comparing the results with FOPID, fuzzy PID (FPID) and PI/PID controller based on recently published optimization techniques like hybrid firefly algorithm-pattern search (hFA-PS) and grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm. The approach is further extended to restructured multi-source hydrothermal and thermal gas systems. It is observed that the dynamic performance of the proposed BFOA optimized FOFPID controller is superior to BFOA optimized FPID/FOPID/PID and differential evolution (DE)/genetic algorithm (GA) optimized PID controllers. It is also detected that the dynamic responses obtained under different power transactions with/without appropriate generation rate constraint, time delay and governor dead-zone effectively satisfy the AGC requirement in deregulated environment. Moreover, robustness of the suggested approach is verified against wide variations in the nominal initial loading, system parameters, distribution company participation matrix structure and size and position of uncontracted power demand.

"Objectives: To study the association of clinical and/or ultrasound variables with patients' (PGA) and physicians' (EGA) global assessment of disease activity in psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The correlation of these parameters with the discordance between PGA and EGA, as well as with PGA/EGA changes over 6 months was also investigated. Methods: Prospective study of 83 consecutive PsA patients with 2 visits scheduled 6 months apart. All patients underwent the following assessments: tender (TJC) and swollen joint count (SJC), PASI, dactylitis and Leeds enthesitis index. PGA, patients' level of pain (pain VAS), EGA, and HAQ were also recorded. Grey scale (GS) and power Doppler (PD) ultrasound were performed at 68 joints (evaluating synovia and tendons) and 14 entheses. Regression analyses were performed to assess the association of these variables with PGA and EGA. Two new variables ""PGA(minus)EGA"" and ""PGAchange - EGAchange"" were developed to explore the discrepancy between PGA and EGA and the consistency of PGA/EGA changes over time, respectively. Results: The parameters explaining most of PGA and EGA variability were pain VAS (30.5%) and SJC (48.5%), respectively. The correlation between EGA and joint counts was stronger in patients with high vs. low levels of ultrasound verified inflammation. PGA(minus)EGA was mainly explained by pain and SJC. Pain was the most important predictor of PGA change whereas TJC and HAQ were more closely associated with EGA changes. ""PGAchange-EGAchange"" was linked to pain and SJC. Ultrasound scores were not linked with either of these variables. Conclusions: Pain VAS and joint counts are the most important clinical parameters explaining patients' and physicians' perception of disease activity, whereas the correlation of active inflammation as verified by sonography with these factors is limited.

"Detection of data structures in spectral clustering approaches becomes a difficult task when dealing with complex distributions. Moreover, there is a need of a real user prior knowledge about the influence of the free parameters when building the graph. Here, we introduce a graph pruning approach, termed Kernel Alignment based Graph Pruning (KAGP), within a spectral clustering framework that enhances both the local and global data consistencies for a given input similarity. The KAGP allows revealing hidden data structures by finding relevant pair-wise relationships among samples. So, KAGP estimates the loss of information during the pruning process in terms of a kernel alignment-based cost function. Besides, we encode the sample similarities using a compactly supported kernel function that allows obtaining a sparse data representation to support spectral clustering techniques. Attained results shows that KAGP enhances the clustering performance in most of the cases. In addition, KAGP avoids the need for a comprehensive user knowledge regarding the influence of its free parameters. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",41
"Background Affordable, feasible and efficacious interventions to reduce neonatal infections and improve neonatal survival are needed. Chlorhexidine, a broad spectrum topical antiseptic agent, is active against aerobic and anaerobic organisms and reduces neonatal bacterial colonisation and may reduce infection. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of neonatal skin or cord care with chlorhexidine versus routine care or no treatment for prevention of infections in late preterm or term newborn infants in hospital and community settings. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, latest issue of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1966 to November 2013), EMBASE (1980 to November 2013), and CINAHL (1982 to November 2013). Ongoing trials were detected by searching the following databases: www.clinicaltrials.gov and www.controlled-trials.com. Selection criteria Cluster and individual patient randomised controlled trials of chlorhexidine use (for skin care, or cord care, or both) in term or late preterm neonates in hospital and community settings were eligible for inclusion. Three authors independently screened and selected studies for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data, and assessed study risk of bias. The quality of evidence for each outcome was assessed using GRADE. We calculated pooled risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences (RDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and presented results using GRADE 'Summary of findings' tables. Main results We included 12 trials in this review. There were seven hospital-based and five community-based studies. In four studies maternal vaginal wash with chlorhexidine was done in addition to neonatal skin and cord care. Newborn skin or cord cleansing with chlorhexidine compared to usual care in hospitals Low-quality evidence from one trial showed that chlorhexidine cord cleansing compared to dry cord care may lead to no difference in neonatal mortality (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.04). Moderate-quality evidence from two trials showed that chlorhexidine cord cleansing compared to dry cord care probably reduces the risk of omphalitis/infections (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.84). Low-quality evidence from two trials showed that chlorhexidine skin cleansing compared to dry cord care may lead to no difference in omphalitis/infections (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.39). None of the studies in this comparison reported effects of the treatments on neonatal mortality. Newborn skin or cord cleansing with chlorhexidine compared to usual care in the community High-quality evidence from three trials showed that chlorhexidine cord cleansing compared to dry cord care reduces neonatal mortality (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.92) and omphalitis/infections (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.57). High-quality evidence from one trial showed no difference between chlorhexidine skin cleansing and usual skin care on neonatal mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.23). None of the studies in this comparison reported effects of the treatments on omphalitis/infections. Maternal vaginal chlorhexidine in addition to total body cleansing compared to no intervention (sterile saline solution) in hospitals Moderate-quality evidence from one trial showed no difference between maternal vaginal chlorhexidine in addition to total body cleansing and no intervention on neonatal mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.42). High-quality evidence from two trials showed no difference between maternal vaginal chlorhexidine in addition to total body cleansing and no intervention on the risk of infections (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.16). Findings from one trial showed that maternal vaginal cleansing in addition to total body cleansing results in increased risk of hypothermia (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.49). Maternal vaginal chlorhexidine in addition to total body cleansing compared to no intervention (sterile saline solution) in the community Low-quality evidence from one trial showed no difference between maternal vaginal chlorhexidine in addition to total body cleansing and no intervention on neonatal mortality (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.03). Moderate-quality evidence from one trial showed that maternal vaginal chlorhexidine in addition to total body cleansing compared to no intervention probably reduces the risk of neonatal infections (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.95). These studies did not report effect on omphalitis. Authors' conclusions There is some uncertainty as to the effect of chlorhexidine applied to the umbilical cords of newborns in hospital settings on neonatal mortality. The quality of evidence for the effects on infection are moderate for cord application and low for application to skin. There is high-quality evidence that chlorhexidine skin or cord care in the community setting results in a 50% reduction in the incidence of omphalitis and a 12% reduction in neonatal mortality. Maternal vaginal chlorhexidine compared to usual care probably leads to no difference in neonatal mortality in hospital settings. Maternal vaginal chlorhexidine compared to usual care results in no difference in the risk of infections in hospital settings. The uncertainty over the effect of maternal vaginal chlorhexidine on mortality outcomes reflects small sample sizes and low event rates in the community settings.",114
"Purpose: To investigate the protective effect of green tea (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) on ultraviolet B (UV-B)-induced skin damages in hairless mice in order to develop a natural sunscreen compound for use in skin care products and cosmetics. Methods: EGCg was dissolved in acetone at concentrations of 1.0, 10.0 and 50.0 mg/mL, and topically applied to the skin of hairless mice at doses of 0.2 mL/cm(2), with acetone as control. The mice were then irradiated by 100 mu W/cm(2) UV-B for 30 min daily. EGCg treatment and UV-B irradiation were carried out daily for 28 consecutive days. The mice were then sacrificed and their dorsal skin examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on the 28th day. Results: UV-B irradiation induced severe macroscopic skin damage including chapping, cracking and abnormal desquamation in the treated hairless mice. EGCg showed dose-dependent protective effects against UV-B induced damage on the skin. Treatments with 10.0 and 50.0 mg/mL EGCg alleviated UV-B-induced skin damage by suppressing both keratinocyte apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction, along with inhibiting the production of melanin pigment. Conclusion: Topical application of green tea EGCg shows dose-dependent protective effect against UV-B-induced damage on hairless mouse skin. Thus, the plant compound can potentially be used as an alternative agent for photoprotection against UV-B exposure.",114
"Reaction Wheel (RW) is the most popular actuator in the Attitude Control System (ACS) of satellites which has a significant role in performing satellite missions. Reaction wheel supplies the torque and the momentum that is required for satellite attitude control. The RW model which is used in the ACS simulations and FDI algorithms should be an accurate model. On the other hand, each physical module has a special role in the reaction wheel modeling. In this regard, based on elements in the internal structure of this actuator, a precise model of RW is presented. Furthermore, the proposed model of RW is more general and can be used in other types of RW. Moreover, in this paper proposed a new model of the reaction wheel for ACS simulation. The proposed model of RW is validated by a Real-Time HIL test bed in the form of set point commands and profile command.",53
"Test generation is still a problem to design for testability and fault diagnosis for analog circuits. In this paper, an approach to sensitivity analysis based on signal flow graph (SFG) is presented and analyzed firstly. Then design technique for testability is studied in detail in terms of above approach. Furthermore, a prototype system for testing design by using Prolog and Matlab is presented. The approach and the design system are verified with a classical band-pass filter circuit and signal condition circuits of a Dynamic Tuned Gyroscope (DTG). The experimental results show they can be efficiently used to design for testability for a kind of analog circuits.",56
"Short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase (SCEH) is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the oxidation of fatty acids and the catabolic pathway of valine and, to a lesser extent, isoleucine. Deficiency of this enzyme was recently shown to cause an early childhood Leigh syndrome phenotype. The few reported patients were compound heterozygotes for two missense or missense with truncating variants in ECHS1 that encodes SCEH. We describe two siblings with severe refractory lactic acidosis and death within the first 2 days of life. Following negative clinical whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing, we resorted to autozygome/exome analysis on research basis and identified a homozygous splice site mutation (c.88+5G>A) in the two cases. Analysis of cDNA confirmed complete replacement of the normal transcript with an aberrant transcript (r.88_89ins 88+1_88+11) predicting premature truncation of the protein [p.(Ala31Glufs*23)]. Furthermore, quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) showed marked reduction in ECHS1, most likely nonsense-mediated decay (NMD)-mediated. This is the first report of homozygosity for a truncating mutation in ECHS1, which may explain the severe phenotype. Our report highlights the need to consider SCEH deficiency in patients with lethal neonatal lactic acidosis, and the potentially limited sensitivity of untargeted genomic sequencing towards non-canonical splicing mutations, which may explain at least some of the negative' cases on clinical exome/genome sequencing.",37
"Associations between variability in sympathetic nervous system arousal and individual differences in symptom severity were examined for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Thirty-four families participated in a laboratory visit that included continuous measurement of electrodermal activity (EDA) during a battery of naturalistic and structured parent-child, child alone, and direct testing tasks. Multiple indices of EDA were considered. Greater variability in EDA was associated with higher levels of ASD symptoms, with findings generally consistent across tasks. Intellectual functioning did not moderate the relation between EDA and ASD symptoms. Sympathetic arousal tendencies may represent an important individual difference factor for this population. Future directions and conceptualizations of EDA are discussed.",113
"An ear prosthesis was designed in 3D computer graphics software and fabricated using a 3D printing process of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) for use as a hearing aid. In addition, the prosthesis response to pressure and temperature was observed. Pyroelectric and piezoelectric properties of this ear prosthesis were investigated using an astable multivibrator circuit, as changes in PVDF permittivity were observed according to variations of pressure and temperature. The results show that this prosthesis is reliable for use under different conditions of pressure (0 Pa to 16,350 Pa) and temperature (2 degrees C to 90 degrees C). The experimental results show an almost linear and inversely proportional behavior between the stimuli of pressure and temperature with the frequency response. This 3D-printed ear prosthesis is a promising tool and has a great potentiality in the biomedical engineering field because of its ability to generate an electrical potential proportional to pressure and temperature, and it is the first time that such a device has been processed by the additive manufacturing process (3D printing). More work needs to be carried out to improve the performance, such as electrical stimulation of the nervous system, thereby extending the purpose of a prosthesis to the area of sensory perception.",79
"Background/Aims: Identifying the best method to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in bariatric surgery patients has important implications for the clinical care of obese patients and research into the impact of obesity and weight reduction on kidney health. We therefore performed such an analysis in patients before and after surgical weight loss. Methods: Fasting measured GFR (mGFR) by plasma iohexol clearance before and after bariatric surgery was obtained in 36 severely obese individuals. Estimated GFR was calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation, the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation using serum creatinine only, the CKD-EPI equation using serum cystatin C only and a recently derived equation that uses both serum creatinine and cystatin C (CKD-EPIcreat-cystC) and then compared to mGFR. Results: Participants were primarily middle-aged white females with a mean baseline body mass index of 46 +/- 9, serum creatinine of 0.81 +/- 0.24 mg/dl and mGFR of 117 +/- 40 ml/min. mGFR had a stronger linear relationship with inverse cystatin C before (r = 0.28, p = 0.09) and after (r = 0.38, p = 0.02) surgery compared to the inverse of creatinine (before: r = 0.26, p = 0.13; after: r = 0.11, p = 0.51). mGFR fell by 17 +/- 35 ml/min (p = 0.007) following surgery. The CKD-EPIcreat-cystC was unquestionably the best overall performing estimating equation before and after surgery, revealing very little bias and a capacity to estimate mGFR within 30% of its true value over 80% of the time. This was true whether or not mGFR was indexed for body surface area. Conclusions: In severely obese bariatric surgery patients with normal kidney function, cystatin C is more strongly associated with mGFR than is serum creatinine. The CKD-EPIcreat-cystC equation best predicted mGFR both before and after surgery. (C) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel",5
"Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a partial deficiency of porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), the third enzyme in the of heme biosynthetic pathway. It can affect the autonomic, peripheral, and central nervous system. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome is a clinicoradiological entity characterized by headache, seizures, altered consciousness, and visual disorder associated with potentially reversible neuroradiological abnormalities predominantly in the parieto-occipital lobes. Establishing accurate diagnoses of the patient and asymptomatic family members with AIP involves identifying the PBGD enzyme mutations directly. In this study, we report a 28-year-old woman with acute intermittent porphyria who presented with radiological manifestations suggestive of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, she had a novel PBGD frame shift mutation, base 875 and 876 have been deleted resulting in glutamine to a stop codon (Gln292fs), in a Chinese family.

"A long-term organic blueberry trial was planted in October 2006 in Aurora, Oregon, USA to investigate the effect of mulch on soil and plant nutrient status, plant growth, berry yield, irrigation requirements, and weed control efficacy. Mulch treatments were applied at planting: 1) weed mat (geotextile), 2) Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) sawdust, and 3) compost + sawdust (compost applied to soil, then covered with sawdust). This paper addresses mulch treatment effects on soil and plant nutrient status during the first two years of the trial, and the first berry harvest in year 2 (2008). Yard-debris compost used in the field experiment had a pH of 7.3 and low soluble salt (EC <1 mS/cm). The yard debris compost + sawdust treatment produced greater berry yields than sawdust alone in the first bearing season. Relative berry yields were 100% for weedmat, 90% for sawdust + compost, and 70% for sawdust mulch. The positive effects of compost on berry yield were observed across two cultivars, flat or raised beds, and for two organic fertilizer sources (fish emulsion or feather meal) applied at two rates (29 and 57 kg .ha(-1) N). Soil pH underlying the mulch was lowest (most acidic) with weed mat and highest under sawdust + compost mulch. After two years, compost increased soil organic matter (OM; 0-20 cm) by 9 g .kg(-1) vs. weedmat, while sawdust mulch did not increase soil OM. In summary, compost maintained soil pH in the optimum range for blueberry, provided plant-available cations, increased soil organic matter, and increased berry yield (relative to sawdust alone). The mechanism(s) behind the compost benefit deserve further investigation.",93
"HTS (Hash Type System) is a type system designed for component-based high performance computing (CBHPC) platforms, aimed at reconciling portability, modularity by separation of concerns, a high-level of abstraction and high performance. Portability and modularity are properties of component-based systems that have been extensively validated. For improving the performance of HPC applications, HTS introduces an automated approach for dynamically discovering, loading and binding parallel components tuned for the characteristics of the parallel computing platforms where the application will execute. To do so, it is based on contextual abstraction, where the performance of components that encapsulate parallel computations, communication patterns and data structures may be tuned according to the features of parallel computing platforms and the application requirements. In turn, for providing a higher level of abstraction in parallel programming, HTS supports an expressive approach for skeleton-based programming. A study of the safety properties of HTS using a calculus of component composition has provided solid foundations for the design of configuration languages for the safe specification and deployment of parallel components. The features of HTS are validated with three case studies that exercise the programming techniques behind contextual abstraction, including skeletons and performance tuning. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"ObjectiveTo describe characteristics of industrial injury hospitalizations, and to test the hypothesis that industrial injuries were increasingly billed to non-workers' compensation (WC) payers over time. Data SourcesHospitalization data for 1998-2009 from State Inpatient Databases, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Study DesignRetrospective secondary analyses described the distribution of payer, age, gender, race/ethnicity, and injury severity for injuries identified using industrial place of occurrence codes. Logistic regression models estimated trends in expected payer. Principal FindingsThere was a significant increase over time in the odds of an industrial injury not being billed to WC in California and Colorado, but a significant decrease in New York. These states had markedly different WC policy histories. Industrial injuries among older workers were more often billed to a non-WC payer, primarily Medicare. ConclusionsFindings suggest potentially dramatic cost shifting from WC to Medicare. This study adds to limited, but mounting evidence that, in at least some states, the burden on non-WC payers to cover health care for industrial injuries is growing, even while WC-related employer costs are decreasingan area that warrants further research.",8

The experiments with Cassandra show good scalability and performance results and how the database size and number of nodes affect it.",112
"Background: Lung cancer is the leading cause of brain metastases (BM). The identification of driver oncogenes and matched targeted therapies has improved outcome in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients; however, a better understanding of BM molecular biology is needed to further drive the process in this field. Methods: In this observational study, stage IV NSCLC patients tested for EGFR and KRAS mutations were selected, and BM incidence, recurrence and patients' outcome were assessed. Results: A total of 144 patients (142 Caucasian and two Asian) were selected, including 11.27% with EGFR-mutant and 33.10% with KRAS-mutant tumors, and 57.04% patients had developed BM. BM incidence was more frequent in patients with EGFR mutation according to multivariate analyses (MVA) (Odds ratio OR = 8.745 [1.743-43.881], p = 0.008). Among patients with treated BM, recurrence after local treatment was less frequent in patients with KRAS mutation (OR = 0.234 [0.078-0.699], p = 0.009). Among patients with untreated BM, overall survival (OS) was shorter for patients with KRAS mutation according to univariate analysis (OR = 7.130 [1.240-41.012], p = 0.028), but not MVA. Conclusions: EGFR and KRAS mutations have a predictive role on BM incidence, recurrence and outcome in Caucasian NSCLC patients. These results may impact the routine management of disease in these patients. Further studies are required to assess the influence of other biomarkers on NSCLC BM.",30
"Engineering designs are typically constrained by requirements and specifications. The Design Analogy Performance Parameters System (D-APPS) project seeks to provide engineers with a means to transform these product requirements and specifications into functional analogies. D-APPS employs design by-Analogy (DbA) via critical functionality and the engineering performance parameters from the specifications to produce functional alternative options to design engineers. Repositories, or databases, provide structured storage of information for retrieval by users in an systemic manner. D-APPS utilizes a repository to store analogy entries, capable of being polled by the developed algorithm. Analogous matches are formulated with the weighting scheme of the algorithm. This research investigates the structures of three alternative repositories, and the current D-APPS database with its interface to the algorithm and design engineer. The architecture of the repository is discussed with example entries and rationale for inclusion.",13
"Recently, several articles (Cullmann, 2012; Agrell et al., 2014; Filippini and Orea, 2014; Llorca et al., 2014) address the issue of benchmarking decision making units with different technologies by using latent class models. This method groups units that have similar technology for better comparison. Under this scheme, there are two implicit assumptions: First, that each class reflects a unique technology where its elements are not outliers. Second, classes are assumed to be stationary and fixed. If this assumption is violated, the classification is transient and time-dependent, inadequate for the regulatory use suggested in the seminal papers. We apply latent class models to classify Swedish electricity distributors under different specifications. In most of the models, we identify one large class with approximately 78.4% of the DMU's and two small classes with 7.4% and 14.2% respectively. Moreover, most of small classes elements switch between categories. We contrast our parametric results with nonparametric outlier detector methods and find a relationship between identified outliers and the elements of smaller residual classes. We believe that our work is an important caveat to the adoption of latent class modelling as an alternative or remedy for conventional models, relying on a homogeneous reference set.",43
"Infrastructure sustainability has become a major global concern. Massive reservoir siltations (RS) have seriously disrupted the service of many reservoirs worldwide. The dredged siltations are difficult to stockpile, or dispose of, because of their high water content and soft nature. This study explores a novel approach using RS to produce controlled low-strength materials (CLSM), reinforced with geobags that are used for storage and backfill applications. Test results have shown that, initially, geobags provided a significant contribution to the strength improvement of an RS-based CLSM. However, effective reinforcement appears to be highly dependent upon the type of geotextile and the original strength of the RS-CLSM. The results show a promising solution for reusing reservoir siltations and ensuring a sustainable approach for the mitigation of a silted reservoir.",93
"For the many application domains concerning entities and their connections, often their data can be formally represented as graphs and an important problem is detecting an anomalous subgraph within it. Numerous methods have been proposed to speed-up anomalous subgraph detection; however, each incurs non-trivial costs on detection accuracy. In this paper, we formulate the anomalous subgraph detection problem as the maximization of a non-parametric scan statistic and then approximate it to a submodular maximization problem. We propose two parallel algorithms: non-coordination anomalous subgraph detection (NCASD) and under-coordination anomalous subgraph detection (UCASD) for the anomalous subgraph detection. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to solve this problem in parallel. NCASD emphasizes speed at the expense of approximation guarantees, while UCASD achieves a higher approximation factor through additional coordination controls and reduced parallelism. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approaches in a real-world application domain (water pollution detection), comparing them with five other state-of-the-art methods.

"Study Objective: To examine differences in factors associated with contraceptive use between younger and older adolescent age groups, which has not previously been well described. Design: Age group-specific analyses were performed on cross-sectional survey data to identify factors associated with any contraceptive use at last sex among younger (14- to 16-year-old) and older (17- to 19-year-old) sexually active African American female adolescents; interaction analyses were used to assess whether these associations differed by age. Setting: Adolescent reproductive health clinic in Atlanta, Georgia. Participants: Sexually active African American female adolescents 14-19 years of age. Interventions: No intervention tested; cross-sectional design. Main Outcome Measure: Self-reported contraceptive use during most recent vaginal sex with a male partner. Results: The prevalence of contraceptive use at last sex was identical in both groups; however, factors associated with contraceptive use differed according to age. The only factor associated with contraceptive use in both age groups was involvement in decisions about sexual health in the most recent relationship. Associations between factors and contraceptive use significantly differed according to age. History of sexually transmitted infection, age difference with partner, discussion of condoms with partner, and concurrent partners were important factors among younger adolescents; worry about pregnancy and discussion of birth control with partner were important among older adolescents. Conclusion: Factors associated with contraceptive use at last sex differ according to adolescent age; this should be considered when designing counseling and interventions for teens, as well as research.",116
"Kidney disease disparately affects those of African descent. Age trends have generally been established for kidney function in the overall US population, but the contribution of age at the time of immigration for African immigrants is unknown. To examine the independent and joint effects of age and age at the time of immigration, and kidney function. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated for 93 African immigrants (60 % male; mean age = 33.5). Hierarchical regression and post hoc analyses revealed a significant age x age at the time of immigration interaction after accounting for traditional risk factors among those who immigrated at age a parts per thousand currency sign21. Younger age at the time of immigration to the US may exacerbate an inverse relationship between age and kidney function in a self-identified healthy African immigrant sample. Investigation of biopsychosocial factors associated with kidney health among African immigrants is warranted.",5
"Background: Natalizumab reduces disease activity in multiple sclerosis (MS). Natalizumab binds to the very late antigen-4 and inhibits vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1)-mediated transmigration of immune cells across the blood-brain-barrier. This is associated with decreased serum concentrations of soluble (s)VCAM-1 and an altered composition of immune cell-subsets in the blood. Objective: We aimed to examine if sVCAM-1 serum concentrations and whole blood mRNA expression levels of immune activation biomarkers is associated with disease activity in natalizumab-treated MS-patients. Methods: sVCAM-1 serum concentrations and whole blood mRNA expression were measured in blood samples from untreated RRMS-patients and from two independent groups of natalizumab-treated patients. Results: sVCAM-1 serum concentrations and whole blood expression of HLX1 and IL1B mRNA were lower, whereas expression of EBI3 mRNA was higher in natalizumab-treated MS-patients. Five genes were differentially expressed in clinically unstable natalizumab-treated MS-patients in the discovery but not in the validation group. Conclusion: Decreased serum concentrations of sVCAM-1 and altered whole blood mRNA expression levels of a panel of immunomarkers, associated with natalizumab-treatment, are not sensitive markers of MS disease activity. However, decreased expression of pro-inflammatory HIX1 and IL1B and increased expression of immunoregulatory EBI3 may indicate a less pathogenic immune activation status in natalizumab-treated MS.

"Representing an important greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from cultivated land is a hot topic in current climate change research. This study examined the influences of nitrogen fertilisation, temperature and soil moisture on the ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (amoA) gene copy numbers and N2O emission characteristics. The experimental observation of N2O fluxes was based on the static chamber-gas chromatographic method. The ammonia-oxidising bacteria (AOB) and ammonia-oxidising archaea (AOA) gene copy numbers in different periods were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The results indicated that rain-fed potato field was a N2O source, and the average annual N2O emission was approximately 0.46 +/- 0.06 kgN(2)O-N/ha/year. N2O emissions increased significantly with increase in fertilisation, temperatures below 19.6 A degrees C and soil volumetric water content under 15%. Crop rotation appreciably decreases N2O emissions by 34.4 to 52.4% compared to continuous cropping in rain-fed potato fields. The significant correlation between N2O fluxes and AOB copy numbers implied that N2O emissions were primarily controlled by AOB in rain-fed potato fields. The research has important theoretical and practical value for understanding N2O emissions from rain-fed dry farmland fields.",37
"Sexual health severely decreases with age. For males older than 40 years, erectile dysfunction (ED) is the most common sexual disorder. Although physical and psychological risk factors for ED have been identified, protective factors are yet to be determined. To date, no study has examined endocrine and psychosocial factors in parallel with regard to their modifying effect on the age-related increase in ED. Two hundred and seventy-one self-reporting healthy men aged between 40 and 75 years provided both psychometric data on sexual function and a set of potential psychosocial protective factors, and saliva samples for the analysis of steroid hormones and proinflammatory cytokines. Around 35% of the participants reported at least a mild form of ED. Direct associations with ED were identified for perceived general health, emotional support, relationship quality, intimacy motivation but not for steroid hormones or proinflammatory markers. Moderation analyses for the association between age and ED revealed positive effects for testosterone (T), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), perceived general health, emotional support, intimacy motivation, and a negative effect for interleukin-6 (all p.17). Group differences between older men with and without ED emerged for T, DHEA, and psychometric measures such as perceived general health, emotional support, satisfaction with life, and intimacy motivation (all p.3). Both psychosocial and endocrine parameters moderated the association between age and sexual health. Perceived general health, emotional support, intimacy motivation, and relationship quality emerged as psychosocial protective factors against ED. Higher T and DHEA and lower interleukin-6 levels also buffered against an age-related increase in ED.",6
"To render future SFR more robust and safe, certain BDBE have been considered in the recent years. A Core Disruptive Accident leading to a whole core meltdown scenario has gained the interest of researchers. Various design concepts and safety measures have been suggested and incorporated in design to address such a low probability scenario. A core catcher concept, in particular, has proved to be inevitable as an in vessel core retention device in SFR for safe retention of core debris arising out after the severe accident. This study aims to analyse the cooling capability of the innovative design concept of core catcher to remove decay heat of degraded core after the accident. First, the capability of single collection tray is established and then the study is extended to two and three collection trays with different design concepts. Transient forms of governing equations of mass, momentum and energy conservations along with k-epsilon turbulence model are solved by finite volume based CFD solver. Boussinesq approximation is invoked to model buoyancy in sodium. The study shows that a single collection tray is capable of removing up to 20 MW decay heat load in a typical 500 MWe pool type SFR. Further, studies are carried out to improve the natural circulation of sodium around the source, in the lower plenum and to distribute core debris of the whole core to multiple collection trays. It is found that the double and triple collection trays can accommodate decay loads up to 29 MW. Provision of openings in the collection trays has proved to be effective in improving the heat transfer and sodium flow as well as in distributing the core debris to the successive plates. Detailed analysis of isotherms and velocity field in the multiple collection trays with openings reveals improved natural circulation in and around the collection trays in the lower plenum. A three tray core catcher device with multiple openings can accommodate the decay heat of whole core meltdown, without exceeding the safe temperature limits of structural material. Special attention has been paid to the space constraint in the lower plenum while incorporating the three tray core catcher device. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",80
"Repeated intermittent exposure to cocaine results in the neurochemical sensitization of dopamine (DA) transmission within the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Indeed, the excitability of DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is enhanced within hours of initial psychostimulant exposure. However, it is not known if this is accompanied by a comparably rapid change in the ability of cocaine to increase extracellular DA concentrations in the ventral striatum. To address this question we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) in awake-behaving rats to measure DA responses in the NAc shell following an initial intravenous cocaine injection, and then again 2-h later. Both injections quickly elevated DA levels in the NAc shell, but the second cocaine infusion produced a greater effect than the first, indicating sensitization. This suggests that a single injection of cocaine induces sensitization-related plasticity very rapidly within the mesolimbic DA system.(C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",104

"BACKGROUND Domination of the biomedical approach to menopause may imply creation of negative attitudes to the phenomenon, and at the same time negatively affect women's life satisfaction and behaviour in the family. It is assumed that physical activity may be a defensive factor, as this type of activity may reduce the intensity of menopause symptoms. The aim of the research was to determine the relation between menopause evaluation, life satisfaction and tactics of influence employed in marriage by women who differ in involvement in physical exercise. PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE The research was conducted among 90 women, at the age of 45-55: 45 physically active women and 45 women who do not engage in any physical activity. The following research methods were used: the Menopause Evaluation Scale, the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) and the Questionnaire of Influence in Close Relations of Women and Men. RESULTS Positive evaluation of menopause was related to involvement in physical exercise as well as to a stronger tendency to use positive strategies of exerting influence on one's spouse. The research also showed a slight correlation between life satisfaction and involvement in physical exercise. Negative evaluation of menopause was related to avoiding physical activity. CONCLUSIONS Physical activity is more frequently related to a positive attitude towards menopause and the use of more positive tactics of exerting influence on one's spouse, and slightly positively conducive to one's life satisfaction level.",9
"The gastrointestinal immune system plays a pivotal role in the host relationship with food antigens, the homeostatic microbiome and enteric pathogens. Here, we describe how to collect and process liver and intestinal samples to efficiently isolate and analyse resident immune cells. Furthermore, we describe a step-by-step methodology showing how to high-dimensionally immunophenotype resident leucocytes using cytometry by time-of-flight, providing a well-characterized antibody platform that allows the identification of every leucocyte subset simultaneously. This protocol also includes instructions to purify and cultivate primary murine hepatocytes, a powerful tool to assess basic cell biology and toxicology assays. Gut and liver samples from the same mouse can be collected, processed and stained in less than 6 hr. This protocol enables the recovery of several populations of purified and viable immune cells from solid and fibrous organs, preventing unwanted loss of adherent cells during isolation.",31
"In this paper, a NMOS-based wideband low power and linear tunable transconductance current differencing transconductance amplifier (CDTA) is presented. Based on the NMOS CDTA, a novel simple and easily reconfigurable configurable analogue block (CAB) is designed. Moreover, using the novel CAB, a simple and versatile butterfly-shaped FPAA structure is introduced. The FPAA consists of six identical CABs, and it could realize six order current-mode low pass filter, second order current-mode universal filter, current-mode quadrature oscillator, current-mode multi-phase oscillator and current-mode multiplier for analog signal processing.

"In the supervised classification, large training data are very common, and decision trees are widely used. However, as some bottlenecks such as memory restrictions, time complexity, or data complexity, many supervised classifiers including classical C4.5 tree cannot directly handle big data. One solution for this problem is to design a highly parallelized learning algorithm. Motivated by this, we propose a parallelized C4.5 decision tree algorithm based on MapReduce (MR-C4.5-Tree) with 2 parallelized methods to build the tree nodes. First, an information entropy-based parallelized attribute selection method (MR-A-S) on several subsets for MR-C4.5-Tree is proposed to confirm the best splitting attribute and the cut points. Then, a data splitting method (MR-D-S) in parallel is presented to partition the training data into subsets. At last, we introduce the MR-C4.5-Tree learning algorithm that grows in a top-down recursive way. Besides, the depth of the constructed decision tree, the number of samples and the maximal class probability in each tree node are used as the termination conditions to avoid the over-partitioning problem. Experimental studies show the feasibility and the good performance of the proposed parallelized MR-C4.5-Tree algorithm.",101
"In past centuries, men have mainly looked to increase their production of energy in order to develop their industry, means of transport and quality of life. Since the recent energy crisis, researchers and industrials have looked mainly to manage energy in a better way, especially by increasing energy system efficiency. This context explains the growing interest for thermoelectric generators. Today, thermoelectric generators allow lost thermal energy to be recovered, energy to be produced in extreme environments, electric power to be generated in remote areas and microsensors to be powered. Direct solar thermal energy can also be used to produce electricity. This review begins with the basic principles of thermoelectricity and a presentation of existing and future materials. Design and optimization of generators are addressed. Finally in this paper, we developed an exhaustive presentation of thermoelectric generation applications covering electricity generation in extreme environments, waste heat recovery in transport and industry, domestic production in developing and developed countries, micro-generation for sensors and microelectronics and solar thermoelectric generators. Many recent applications are presented, as well as the future applications which are currently being studied in research laboratories or in industry. The main purpose of this paper is to clearly demonstrate that, almost anywhere in industry or in domestic uses, it is worth checking whether a TEG can be added whenever heat is moving from a hot source to a cold source.

"The present investigation examined how three salient features of narrative thinking (situation model construction, linguistic concreteness, and perspective-taking) influenced the social inference process. Results of four experiments indicated that compared with those given other objectives, perceivers given narrative objectives were: (a) more likely to make situation rather than trait attributions for observed behaviors (Experiment 1), (b) less likely to make implicit trait inferences (Experiment 2), and (c) less likely to rely on behavior valence when making evaluative judgments (Experiment 4). Linguistic analyses indicated that narrative construction consistently entailed the creation of situation models of events and linguistic concreteness, but only situation model creation mediated the relationship between narrative and inferences. Experiment 3 confirmed the mediating role of situation models: Perceivers with narrative objectives made trait inferences only when behaviors were inconsistent with contextual information. The role of these core narrative features on social perceptions is discussed.",63
"Objectives: This study aims to investigate the efficacy of acupuncture in preventing migraine attacks. Patients and methods: Between December 2013 and June 2014, a total of 54 patients with a diagnosis of migraine in our neurology clinic were randomized into two groups. Venlafaxine was administered for three months to one group (drug therapy group: 4 males, 21 females; mean age 32.0 +/- 9.1 years; range, 18 to 65 years), while the other group was treated with acupuncture (acupuncture group: 5 males, 24 females; mean age 30.3 +/- 7.4 years; range, 18 to 65 years). The control group consisted of a total of 29 healthy individuals (7 males, 22 females; mean age 30.3 +/- 7.4 years; range 18 to 65 years). Blood serotonin levels were assessed before and after treatment along with visual analog scale (VAS) and Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) in both groups. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in the mean analgesic use before and after the treatment and VAS and MIDAS scores between the acupuncture and drug therapy groups (p>0.05). The number and duration of attacks was found to be significantly lower in both groups, compared to the pre-treatment values (p<0.0001). The serotonin levels in the acupuncture and drug therapy groups were significantly higher compared to the pre-treatment values (p<0.001). Serotonin levels were found to be significantly lower in healthy individuals compared to the study groups (p<0.0001). Conclusion: Based on our study findings, acupuncture may be an effective option in the migraine prophylaxis.",127
"This report summarizes the 5-year R&D activities within the U.S. Department of Energy Metal Hydride Center of Excellence (MHCoE). The purpose of the MHCoE was to conduct highly collaborative and multi-disciplinary applied R&D to develop new reversible hydrogen storage materials for light-duty vehicles. The MHCoE combined three broad areas: (a) mechanisms and modeling, which provided a theoretically driven basis for pursuing new materials, (b) materials development, in which new materials were synthesized and characterized and (c) system design and materials engineering, which provided the foundational information to enable new materials to be realized as practical automotive hydrogen storage systems. The MHCoE was organized into four materials-oriented ""projects,"" along with one engineering project. Results from all of the projects are given, as well as an account of the downselection process that identified materials to be pursued further after initial investigation. The downselected materials are compared against material goals derived from the revised 2010 DOE hydrogen storage system targets for light-duty vehicles. Suggestions and recommendations for further R&D directions are given, based on the MHCoE findings. Copyright (C) 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"The potential use of rainwater harvesting in conjunction with miscellaneous water supplies and a rooftop garden with rainwater harvesting facility for temperature reduction have been evaluated in this study for Hong Kong. Various water applications such as toilet flushing and areal climate controls have been systematically considered depending on the availability of seawater toilet flushing using the Geographic Information System (GIS). For water supplies, the district Area Precipitation per Demand Ratio (APDR) has been calculated to quantify the rainwater utilization potential of each administrative district in Hong Kong. Districts with freshwater toilet flushing prove to have higher potential for rainwater harvest and utilization compared to the areas with seawater toilet flushing. Furthermore, the effectiveness of using rainwater harvesting for miscellaneous water supplies in Hong Kong and Tokyo has been analyzed and compared; this revives serious consideration of diurnal and seasonal patterns of rainfall in applying such technology. In terms of the cooling effect, the implementation of a rooftop rainwater harvesting garden has been evaluated using the ENVI-met model. Our results show that a temperature drop of 1.3 degrees C has been observed due to the rainwater layer in the rain garden. This study provides valuable insight into the applicability of the rainwater harvesting for sustainable water management practice in a highly urbanized city. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"Background: Honeybush extracts (Cyclopia spp.) can be incorporated into skin care products to treat conditions such as skin dryness and can function as an anti-oxidant. Objective: To formulate Honeybush formulations and test it for antioxidant activity, skin penetration, and skin hydrating effects. Materials and Methods: Semi-solid formulations containing either Cyclopia maculata (2%) or Cyclopia genistoides (2%) underwent accelerated stability studies. Membrane release studies, Franz cell skin diffusion and tape stripping studies were performed. Antioxidant potential was determined with the 2-thiobarbituric acid-assay and clinical efficacy studies were performed to determine the formulations' effect on skin hydration, scaliness, and smoothness after 2 weeks of treatment on the volar forearm. Results: The formulations were unstable over 3 months. Membrane release, skin diffusion studies, and tape stripping showed that both formulations had inconclusive results due to extremely low concentrations mangiferin and hesperidin present in the Franz cell receptor compartments, stratum corneum-epidermis, and epidermis-dermis layers of the skin. Honeybush extracts showed antioxidant activity with concentrations above 0.6250 mg/ml when compared to the toxin; whereas mangiferin and hesperidin did not show any antioxidant activity on their own. The semisolid formulations showed the potential to emit their own antioxidant activity. Both formulations improved skin smoothness, although they did not improve skin hydration compared to the placebos. C. maculata reduced the skin scaliness to a larger extent than the placebos and C. genistoides. Conclusion: Honeybush formulations did not penetrate the skin but did, however, show antioxidant activity and the potential to be used to improve skin scaliness and smoothness.",114
"Patients with bipolar disorder (BD) are at high risk for developing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) during aging process. However, investigations are lacking regarding the risk factors for CVDs specific to BD patients. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between CVDs and traditional risk factors in association with the characteristics of BD in older age. Totally, we recruited 124 patients with BD-I (DSM-IV) who had at least one psychiatric admission and cardiologist-confirmed CVD diagnosis (ICD-9 code 401-414) at mean age of 61.7 +/- 4.9 years. Each case subject was matched with one BD-I patient without CVDs based on age, sex, and date of the most recent psychiatric admission (2 years). Clinical data were obtained by retrospectively reviewing the medical record. A multiple logistic regression model showed that not only traditional risk factor (e.g., diabetes mellitus) but also non-traditional one associated with BD (e.g., first episode mania) significantly increased the risk of CVDs. Given the limitation of this cross-sectional study, longitudinal investigations are needed to elucidate the contributions of both traditional risk factors and the BD characteristics for CVD risk in patients with BD.",115

"Background: Heart exposure to ionizing irradiation can cause ischaemic heart disease. The partial heart volume receiving >= 5 Gy (heartV5) was supposed to be an independent prognostic factor for survival after radiochemotherapy for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). But validation of the latter hypothesis is needed under the concurrent risks of lung cancer patients. Patients and methods: The ESPATUE phase III trial recruited patients with potentially operable IIIA(N2)/selected IIIB NSCLC between 01/2004 and 01/2013. Cisplatin/paclitaxel induction chemotherapy was given followed by neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (RT/CT) to 45 Gy (1.5 Gy bid/concurrent cisplatin/vinorelbine). Operable patients were randomized to definitive RT/CT(arm A) or surgery (arm B) and therefore were treated at two different total dose levels of radiotherapy. HeartV5 and mean heart dose (MHD) were obtained from the 3D radiotherapy plans, the prognostic value was analysed using multivariable proportional hazard analysis. Results: A total of 161 patients were randomized in ESPATUE, heartV5 and MHD were obtained from the 3D radiotherapy plans for 155 of these [male/female: 105/50, median age 58 (33-74) years, stage IIIA/IIIB: 54/101]. Power analysis revealed a power of 80% of this dataset to detect a prognostic value of heartV5 of the size found in RTOG 0617. Multivariable analysis did not identify heartV5 as an independent prognostic factor for survival adjusting for tumour and clinical characteristics with [hazard ratio 1.005 (0.995-1.015), P = 0.30] or without lower lobe tumour location [hazard ratio 0.999 (0.986-1.012), P = 0.83]. There was no influence of heartV5 on death without tumour progression. Tumour progression, and pneumonia were the leading causes of death representing 65% and 14% of the observed deaths. Conclusions: HeartV5 could not be validated as an independent prognostic factor for survival after neoadjuvant or definitive conformal radiochemotherapy. Tumour progression was the predominant cause of death.",129
"Electrical stimulation of the greater occipital nerve (GON) has recently shown promise as an effective non-pharmacological prophylactic therapy for drug-resistant chronic primary headaches, but the neurobiological mechanisms underlying its anticephalgic action are not elucidated. Considering that the spinal trigeminal nucleus (STN) is a key segmental structure playing a prominent role in pathophysiology of headaches, in the present study we evaluated the effects of GON electrical stimulation on ongoing and evoked firing of the dura-sensitive STN neurons. The experiments were carried out on urethane/chloralose-anesthetized, paralyzed and artificially ventilated male Wistar rats. Extracellular recordings were made from 11 neurons within the caudal part of the STN that received convergent input from the ipsilateral facial cutaneous receptive fields, dura mater and GON. In each experiment, five various combinations of the GON stimulation frequency (50, 75, 100 Hz) and intensity (1, 3, 6 V) were tested successively in 10 min interval. At all parameter sets, preconditioning GON stimulation (250 ms train of pulses applied before each recording) produced suppression of both the ongoing activity of the STN neurons and their responses to electrical stimulation of the dura mater. The inhibitory effect depended mostly on the GON stimulation intensity, being maximally pronounced when a stimulus of 6 V was applied. Thus, the GON stimulation-induced inhibition of trigeminovascular nociceptive processing at the level of STN has been demonstrated for the first time. The data obtained can contribute to a deeper understanding of neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the therapeutic efficacy of GON stimulation in primary headaches.",10
"This paper presents a systematic review on the effectiveness of prevention, early intervention, and harm reduction including treatment of substance abuse among adolescents for tobacco, alcohol and illicit drugs. Taxation, public consumption bans, restriction on advertisements, and minimum legal age for consumption, are effective measures to reduce the use of tobacco and alcohol. School-based prevention and skill-training interventions are effective tools to reduce substance use among adolescents. Social norms and intervention to reduce substance use in adolescents do not have strong evidence of effectiveness. Road-side testing and reduction of injection related harm are effective. However, further research is needed to support it. Moreover, the available research evidence comes from the Western countries with questionable applicability in Indian setting. Research is needed to increase the evidence base on interventions that aim to reduce the high burden of substance use in adolescents in India.",26
"Background: Acute limb ischemia (ALI) is a clinical entity with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Despite advances and variety of its management, there is still no criterion standard treatment. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of tirofiban use on the early and 6-month prognosis of patients with knee and below-knee arterial thrombosis who were treated with percutaneous thrombosuction (PT) within 24 h. Material/Methods: Data of consecutive ALI patients who were diagnosed with popliteal and infra-popliteal arterial thrombosis and underwent PT procedure within 24 h between January 2010 and September 2015 were evaluated retrospectively. Patients were separated into 2 groups according to tirofiban usage. Results: A total of 105 patients (mean age 67 +/- 16; 53% men) were included in the study. Atrial fibrillation (n 64, 61%) and hypertension (n 60, 57%) were the most frequent comorbidities in patients with thromboembolic events. A significantly higher rate of distal embolization (6% vs. 16%; p=0.01) and slow-flow (17% vs. 30%; p<0.01) developed in patients who were not treated with tirofiban after the PT procedure. Although major and minor bleeding were more frequent in the tirofiban group, only the rate minor bleeding was statistically significant (29% vs. 9%, p=0.001). Reverse embolic event ratio was similar in both groups. Although there was a higher rate of amputation in patients not treated with tirofiban, the difference was not significant. Conclusions: Adding tirofiban to PT reduces angiographic thromboembolic complications. Usage of tirofiban in patients prone to thromboembolic events may be useful for improving success of the PT procedure, with a reasonable bleeding ratio.",111
"Phytochemical investigation of the stem bark of Xylopia pierrei Hance led to the isolation of one triterpene, polycarpol (1), three heptenes, (7R)-acetylmelodorinol (2), (7R)-melodorinol (3), and melodienone (8), and four flavonoids, pinocembrin (4), isochamanetin (5), chrysin (6), and dichamanetin (7). All compounds were isolated for the first time from this plant species. The structures of the isolated compounds were characterized by spectroscopic techniques and by comparison of the spectroscopic data with the literature values and the stereochemistry at the asymmetric carbon was determined by the modified Mosher's method. Among them, compound 2 displayed potent cytotoxic activity against human small cell lung cancer (NCI-H187) cells with an IC50 value of 6.66 mu M and it was 2.3-fold higher than that of the reference anticancer drug, ellipticine. In addition, compound 2 was also evaluated against the non-cancerous Vero cells and showed high selectivity index of 8.89, which is 59-fold greater than that of ellipticine. The findings suggest that compound 2 should be further developed as a potential lead molecule for anticancer drug development.",14
Direct numerical simulations are used to study the interaction of a cavity-backed circular orifice with grazing laminar and turbulent boundary layers and incident sound waves. The flow conditions and geometry are representative of single degree-of-freedom acoustic liners applied in the inlet and exhaust ducts of aircraft engines and are the same as those from experiments conducted at NASA Langley. The simulations identify the fluid mechanics of how the sound field and state of the grazing boundary layer impact the in-orifice flow and suggest a simple flow analogy that enables scaling estimates. From the scaling estimates the simulations are then used to develop reduced-order models for the in-orifice flow and a time-domain impedance model is constructed. The liner is found to increase drag at all conditions studied by an amount that increases with the incident sound pressure amplitude.,86
"This article presents a realization of electronically tunable current-mode Elliptic ladder low-pass filter using CCCIIs. The passive RLC ladder filters prototype and signal flow graph method (SFG) are employed for synthesis. The CCCII-based lossy, lossless integrators and current attenuator are required for the circuit realization. The proposed filter circuit can be electronically tuned between 1 kHz and 1 MHz through bias current from 0.05 mu A to 50 mu A. The proposed filter use +/- 1.5V power supply with 6 mW power consumption at 50 mu A bias current. The proposed filter uses grounded capacitors without external resistors which is suitable for further integration. The total harmonic distortion (THD) of the low-pass filters is less than 0.5% over the operating frequency range. PSPICE simulation results are carried out, obtained by using BJT model parameter of HFA 3046, confirm the presented theory.",56
"We present a method for structural and fluid mechanics computations of ram-air parachutes. A ram-air parachute is a parafoil inflated by the airflow through the inlets at the leading edge. It has better control and gliding capability than round parachutes. Reliable analysis of ram-air parachutes requires accurate representation of the parafoil geometry, fabric porosity and the complex, multiscale flow behavior involved in this class of problems. The key components of the method are (i) the Space-Time Variational Multiscale (ST-VMS) method, (ii) the version of the ST Slip Interface (ST-SI) method where the SI is between a thin porous structure and the fluid on its two sides, (iii) the ST Isogeometric Analysis (ST-IGA), and (iv) special-purpose NURBS mesh generation techniques for the parachute structure and the flow field inside and outside the parafoil. The ST-VMS method is a stabilized formulation that also serves as a turbulence model and can deal effectively with the complex, multiscale flow behavior. With the STSI version for porosity modeling, we deal with the fabric porosity in a fashion consistent with how we deal with the standard SIs and how we enforce the Dirichlet boundary conditions weakly. The ST-IGA, with NURBS basis functions in space, gives us, with relatively few number of unknowns, accurate representation of the parafoil geometry and increased accuracy in the flow solution. The special-purpose mesh generation techniques enable NURBS representation of the structure and fluid domains with significant geometric complexity. The test computations we present are for building a starting parachute shape and a starting flow field associated with that parachute shape, which are the first two key steps in fluid-structure interaction analysis. The computations demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in this class of problems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",86
"A Phase Locked Loop (PLL) based method for determining audio authenticity is proposed in this work. Assuming that the power grid signal is embedded in an audio signal, certain pre-processing techniques are applied in order to obtain the Electrical Network Frequency (ENF). A PLL is then used to estimate the time-varying phase of the ENF signal. Postprocessing is carried out so as to improve system performance. Finally, an automatic decision on the authenticity of the audio is conducted by quantifying the frequency variations of the VCO output. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on digitally edited and original audio signals, with promising results (achieving an accuracy of 96%).",50
"Background Previous research has revealed a clear relationship between weight gain of persons and their metabolic diseases developing later. These studies have covered only short periods lasting 4-8 years. Our goal was to collect decades' old and often life-long anthropometric data and correlate the figures with the presence of hypertension and diabetes or both. Methods A retrospective international study was planned and organized to compare self-recorded data of lifelong weight gain among 60-70-year-old patients, analyze their correlation with metabolic diseases they developed, with special attention to women's weight gain around pregnancy, delivery and menopause in primary care settings in Germany, Hungary, Italy, Slovakia and the Ukraine. Results Of the recruited 815 participants, 319 men and 496 women presented all the required data. Diabetics of both genders had the highest baseline weight at 20 years of age. The weight and BMI of the whole study population increased steadily until their seventies, but to a lesser extent after their fifties. Compared to the control group, changes over decades were the greatest among diabetics and also greater among patients with hypertension. Weight increase in the first decades (20-30-year-old men and 30-40-year-old women) was a significant risk factor for the development of diabetes (OR = 1.044; p = 0.002; 95 % CI: 1.01-1.07). Among patients with diabetes and hypertension, both diagnoses were set up earlier than among those with a single morbidity. Among females, weight increase around pregnancy and menopause correlated significantly with higher odds for the diagnoses of diabetes and/or hypertension, irrespective of the number of children. Conclusions During their decade-long relationship with their patients, family physicians are expected to identify the higher weight gain of their patients, especially among younger generation and intervene, if necessary.",9
"To examine the associations of recent intimate partner violence (IPV) and reproductive coercion (RC) with frequency of use of reproductive and sexual health services, a cross-sectional survey was administered to 16-29 year old women seeking care in five family planning clinics (n = 1,262). We evaluated associations of recent experiences of IPV, RC, or both IPV and RC with recent care seeking for pregnancy testing, emergency contraception, and sexually transmitted infection testing using multinomial logistic regression. Sixteen percent of respondents reported IPV and 13.5 % reported RC in the past 3 months. Four percent of all respondents reported both IPV and RC. Recent RC without IPV was associated with increased odds of seeking one (AOR = 2.0, 95 % CI 1.3-2.9) or multiple pregnancy tests (AOR = 2.3, 95 % CI 1.2-4.5), multiple STI tests (AOR = 2.5, 95 % CI 1.5-4.1), or using emergency contraception once (AOR = 2.6, 95 % CI 1.2-5.8) or multiple times (AOR = 2.2, 95 % CI 1.7-2.7). Recent IPV without RC was associated with increased odds of seeking one (AOR = 1.4, 95 % CI 1.1-1.7) or multiple pregnancy tests (AOR = 2.2, 95 % CI 1.4-3.2) and using emergency contraception once (AOR = 1.6, 95 % CI 1.3-2.0). The combined effect of recent IPV and RC increased the odds of seeking multiple pregnancy tests (AOR = 3.6, 95 % CI 3.3-3.8), using emergency contraception multiple times (AOR = 2.4, 95 % CI 1.5-4.1) and seeking STI testing once (AOR = 2.5, 95 % CI 1.6-3.9) or multiple times (AOR = 2.9, 95 % CI 1.02-8.5). Frequent requests for pregnancy and STI testing and emergency contraception among young females seeking care may be an indicator of greater risk for recent RC, alone and in combination with IPV.",124

"Wind power integration in an existing power system needs more attention due to its uncertain nature. If a difference creates between the actual and forecasted wind speeds and the power delivery contract is signed between the Generation Companies (GENCOs) and Distribution Companies (DISCOs) as per the forecasted speed, then the GENCOs may be awarded or penalized by the Independent System Operator (ISO) for their surplus or deficit power supply. This paper proposes an approach to assess the uncertainties of wind speed of the wind integrated electrical system within a completely deregulated environment. In this work, twelve spots in India have been chosen randomly for the application of the proposed approach and to verify the outcome of the proposed approach. The real time data for actual wind speed (AWS) and forecasted wind speed (FWS) of all selected spots have been also considered. The imbalance cost due to mismatch between the forecasted and actual wind speeds is evaluating by formulation of surplus charge rate and deficit charge rate. Modified IEEE 14-bus and modified IEEE 30-bus systems are considered for analyzing the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",80
"Background: Microbial production of nitrogen containing compounds requires a high uptake flux and assimilation of the N-source (commonly ammonium), which is generally coupled with ATP consumption and negatively influences the product yield. In the industrial workhorse Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ammonium (NH4+) uptake is facilitated by ammonium permeases (Mep1, Mep2 and Mep3), which transport the NH4+ ion, resulting in ATP expenditure to maintain the intracellular charge balance and pH by proton export using the plasma membrane-bound H+ -ATPase. Results: To decrease the ATP costs for nitrogen assimilation, the Mep genes were removed, resulting in a strain unable to uptake the NH4+ ion. Subsequent analysis revealed that growth of this Delta mep strain was dependent on the extracellular NH3 concentrations. Metabolomic analysis revealed a significantly higher intracellular NHX concentration (3.3-fold) in the Delta mep strain than in the reference strain. Further proteomic analysis revealed significant up-regulation of vacuolar proteases and genes involved in various stress responses. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the uncharged species, NH3, is able to diffuse into the cell. The measured intracellular/extracellular NHX ratios under aerobic nitrogen-limiting conditions were consistent with this hypothesis when NHx compartmentalization was considered. On the other hand, proteomic analysis indicated a more pronounced N-starvation stress response in the Delta mep strain than in the reference strain, which suggests that the lower biomass yield of the Delta mep strain was related to higher turnover rates of biomass components.",88
"Purpose The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of hypothyroidism as a cause of hyponatremia in a clinical model of iatrogenic acute hypothyroidism due to thyroid hormone withdrawal prior to ablative radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy after total thyroidectomy. Methods The study group consisted of 101 differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients (77 women and 24 men). Plasma concentration of thyroid-stimulating hormone ([TSH]) and sodium ([Na+]) was evaluated before total thyroidectomy (pre[TSH] and pre[Na+]) and on the day of RAI therapy (post[TSH] and post[Na+]). Results The frequency of hypothyroidism-associated hyponatremia was 4 % (4/101). Pre[Na+] was significantly higher than post[Na+] (140.7 +/- 1.6 vs 138.7 +/- 2.3 mEq/L, p = 0.012). Moreover, a linear correlation was identified between pre[Na+] and post[Na+]. Conclusion Iatrogenic acute hypothyroidism-related hyponatremia is uncommon. However, because of the significant reduction of [Na+] in the transition from euthyroidism to iatrogenic hypothyroidism, the value of pre[Na+] should be viewed as a parameter to be considered. Since it acts as an independent risk factor for the development of hyponatremia, patients with a pre[Na+] close to the lower limit of normal range may deserve a closer monitoring of [Na+].",133
"Objectives: Both temporomandibular disorder (TMD) and knee osteoarthritis (KOA) are prevalent joint diseases; however, an association between them has not been reported. Therefore, this study investigated the prevalence of the specific symptoms and signs of TMDs (SSTs) in patients with KOA. Methods: In total, 200 patients with KOA and 150 healthy individuals were recruited. The prevalence of specific SSTs in patients with mild or severe KOA was compared with the prevalence of specific SSTs in the control group and the results were analysed using a chi-square test. Logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounders, such as gender and age. Results: The prevalence of 'impaired range of jaw movement (IRM)' was 63.6% (n = 77) in the mild KOA group and 62.4% (n = 117) in the severe KOA group; the values for both KOA groups were significantly higher than that for the non-OA control group (34.7%, n = 144; P < 0.017). In addition, 54.7% of the patients with severe KOA reported 'impaired temporomandibular joint (TMJ) function', a value significantly higher than that of the control group (39.6%, P < 0.017). No significant differences between groups were found for other SSTs. Conclusions: Patients with KOA might be more likely to experience SSTs, such as IRM and impaired TMJ function.",15
"Bright light therapy has been shown to have a positive impact on seasonal affective disorder (SAD), depression and anxiety. Smell has also has been shown to have effects on mood, stress, anxiety and depression. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the combination of light and smell in a non-adaptive cycle. Human subjects were given smell (lemon, lavender or peppermint) and light stimuli in a triangular wave (60 s cycle) for 15 min. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored before and after each session for 5 consecutive days and a Profile of Mood States (POMS) test was administered before and after the sensory stimulation on days 1, 3 and 5. The light-smell stimulus lowered blood pressure, both systolic and diastolic, and reduced heart rate for all odours compared to control. Of the two sensory stimuli, the odour stimulus contributed most to this effect. The different aromas in the light-smell combinations could be distinguished by their different effects on the mood factors with lemon inducing the greatest mood changes in Dejection-Depression, Anger-Hostility, Tension-Anxiety. In conclusion, combined light and smell stimulation was effective in lowering blood pressure, reducing heart rate and improving mood. The combination was more effective than either smell or light stimuli alone, suggesting that a light-smell combination would be a more robust and efficacious alternative treatment for depression, anxiety and stress.

"Study Objective: Long acting reversible contraceptives, including etonogestrel implants, are top tier contraceptives for adolescents, yet they remained underutilized. This study aimed to assess awareness of and attitudes toward etonogestrel implants among adolescent and young adult women. Design, Main Outcome Measures: This is a cross sectional study. We distributed an original, self-administered survey to a convenience sample of anonymous subjects. The survey assessed demographic information, pregnancy and sexual history, general contraceptive preferences, and awareness of implants. Subjects then read a brief description of implants before completing the section assessing attitudes toward them. We used chi-square and t-test analyses to identify factors associated with awareness of and positive attitudes toward implants. Setting, Participants: Women aged 10-24 attending a birth control education group at an adolescent health center in New York City. Results: Of the 129 participants, only 40% had heard of etonogestrel implants. Some (33%) reported positive attitudes toward implants. Positive attitudes were associated with preferences for birth control convenience (OR = 3.3, 95% CI = 1.1-9.5) and privacy (OR = 2.2, 95% Cl = 1.0-4.8). Neutral or negative attitudes were associated with a preference for birth control that maintained menstrual regularity (OR = 0.4, 95% Cl = 0.2-0.8) and with having experienced at least 1 unintended pregnancy (OR = 0.4, 95% Cl = 0.2-0.9). Age, race, and education were not associated with participants' attitudes toward implants. Conclusions: Women who value convenience and privacy are more likely to report positive attitudes toward implants, and thus may represent especially receptive candidates for them.",116
"Objective. The aim was to characterize SLE medication trends before, during and after pregnancy and to compare other commonly used medications during SLE pregnancies with non-SLE pregnancies. Methods. Women with pregnancies ending in live birth or stillbirth were identified from the Swedish Medical Birth Register (2006-12). National registers were used to identify women with prevalent SLE during pregnancy and a sample without SLE and to identify prescription medications dispensed from 3 months pre-pregnancy until 6 months postpartum. We reported the prevalence of DMARDs, systemic CSs and NSAIDs (aspirin reported separately) in SLE pregnancies. We calculated prevalence estimates of other medications that were dispensed during pregnancy to a (c) 3/4 5% of SLE pregnancies and for the same medications among non-SLE pregnancies. Results. There were 483 pregnancies among women with SLE and 5723 pregnancies among women without SLE. In SLE pregnancies, 49.3% had one or more dispensing for DMARDs during pregnancy; the prevalence was 48.0% for CSs, 40.8% for aspirin and 6.0% for other NSAIDs and varied by pregnancy period. The prevalence of common medications among SLE pregnancies was 1.2- to 20-fold higher than among non-SLE pregnancies; for example, dalteparin (20.9 vs 1.0%), paracetamol (18.2 vs 2.9%) and levothyroxine (15.9 vs 4.9%). Conclusion. In nearly half of SLE pregnancies, women were dispensed DMARDs and CSs. Commonly used medications in SLE pregnancies had far higher prevalence estimates compared with non-SLE pregnancies. Research regarding benefits and risks of commonly used medications on SLE pregnancies, breast milk and long-term outcomes for offspring is needed.",16
"An 8-channels read-out front-end for LHC ATLAS Muon-Drift-Tubes detectors is presented (8xAFE). The system is composed by the cascade of the analog signal processing Front-End and of the Wilkinson A/D (to perform voltage-to-time conversion for time-over-threshold detection). The sensitivity at the output of the analog signal processing chain is 13.8mV/fC, while the Equivalent-Noise-Charge (ENC) is 0.6fC (similar to 3.38ke), performing <12ns preamplifier rise-time. These performances have been achieved, managing very high detector parasitic capacitance at the front-end input (similar to 60pF). Each channel consumes 11mA from a single 3.3V supply voltage. In 0.13 mu m CMOS, the total area occupancy is 6.3mm(2).",52
"A novel label-free system for the sensitive fluorescent detection of deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) activity has been developed by utilizing DNA-templated silver nanocluster/graphene oxide (DNA-AgNC/GO) nanocomposite. AgNC is first synthesized around C-rich template DNA and the resulting DNA-AgNC binds to GO through the interaction between the extension DNA and GO. The resulting DNA-AgNC/GO would show quite reduced fluorescence signal because the fluorescence from DNA-AgNCs is quenched by GO. In the presence of DNase I, however, it degrades the DNA strand within DNA/RNA hybrid duplex probe employed in this study, consequently releasing RNA which is complementary to the extension DNA. The released free RNA then extracts DNA-AgNC from GO by hybridizing with the extension DNA bound to GO. This process would restore the quenched fluorescence, emitting highly enhanced fluorescence signal. By employing this assay principle, DNase I activity was reliably identified with a detection limit of 0.10 U/ml which is lower than those from previous fluorescence-based methods. Finally, the practical capability of this assay system was successfully demonstrated by its use to determine DNase I activity in bovine urine. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",14
"Finite element mesh generators exist in the public domain, a few even based on a parametric device description. The typical mesh generator requires some man-machine interaction to define the points and boundary conditions, and does not work for non-stop optimization iterations for which we need a mesh dynamically evolving through the iterations with optimization variables as changing parameters. Such mesh generators as do exist are rare, commercial, and not easily available to researchers except at great cost and never with the code to modify them to suit individual needs. We take a regular open source mesh generator and write a script-based interface as open source to run non-stop for optimization. We then use it to create a non-destructive evaluation system for army ground vehicles' defect characterization and use it equally for machine design. A simple scheme of averaging neighbour heights gives us a smooth geometry without having to use Bezier curves. The mesh runs on the central processing unit but finite element optimization is on the graphics processing unit for speed and practicable testing times.",85
"The glycogen branching enzyme (EC 2.4.1.18), which catalyses the formation of alpha-1,6-glycosidic branch points in glycogen structure, is often used to enhance the nutritional value and quality of food and beverages. In order to be applicable in industries, enzymes that are stable and active at high temperature are much desired. Using genome mining, the nucleotide sequence of the branching enzyme gene (glgB) was extracted from the Geobacillus mahadia Geo-05 genome sequence provided by the Malaysia Genome Institute. The size of the gene is 2013 bp, and the theoretical molecular weight of the protein is 78.43 kDa. The gene sequence was then used to predict the thermostability, function and the three dimensional structure of the enzyme. The gene was cloned and overexpressed in E. coli to verify the predicted result experimentally. The purified enzyme was used to study the effect of temperature and pH on enzyme activity and stability, and the inhibitory effect by metal ion on enzyme activity. This thermostable glycogen branching enzyme was found to be most active at 55 degrees C, and the half-life at 60 degrees C and 70 degrees C was 24 h and 5 h, respectively. From this research, a thermostable glycogen branching enzyme was successfully isolated from Geobacillus mahadia Geo-05 by genome mining together with molecular biology technique.",30
"Rework is a stubborn issue in the construction industry, and it has been drawing considerable attention from the industry and academia over the past decades. However, so far, little effort has been made to investigate reworks in green building construction projects. This study aims to assess the status quo of rework in green building construction projects in Singapore, identify and evaluate the rework factors in green building construction projects, compare their criticalities with those in the conventional counterparts, and propose a set of feasible solutions. To achieve these aims, a questionnaire survey was administered, and data collected from 30 different construction companies were analyzed. Results showed that, compared to conventional building construction projects, green building construction projects tended to have a lower incidence of rework, but suffered more from the rework's adverse impacts in terms of cost overrun and schedule delay. Results also showed that the top four most critical rework factors in green building construction projects were ""owner change"", ""design change"", ""design error/omission"" and ""contractor's error/omission"". In addition, this study proposed five practical solutions that can help curb reworks in green building construction projects. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by examining the rework problem in green building construction projects. Meanwhile, this study contributes to the industry by providing the practitioners with an in-depth understanding of rework in green building construction projects. The specific solutions proposed by this study can also offer the industry practitioners direct help in reducing works in such projects.",99
"The widespread adoption of combined heat and power generation is widely recognized as a strategic goal to achieve significant primary energy savings and lower carbon dioxide emissions. In this context, the purpose of this research is to evaluate the potential of cogeneration based on reciprocating gas engines for some Italian hospital buildings. Comparative analyses have been conducted based on the load profiles of two specific hospital facilities and through the study of the cogeneration system-user interaction. To this end, a specific methodology has been set up by coupling a specifically developed calculation algorithm to a genetic optimization algorithm, and a multi-objective approach has been adopted. The results from the optimization problem highlight a clear trade-off between total primary energy savings (TPES) and simple payback period (SPB). Optimized plant configurations and management strategies show TPES exceeding 18% for the reference hospital facilities and multi-gas engine solutions along with a minimum SPB of approximately three years, thereby justifying the European regulation promoting cogeneration. However, designing a CHP plant for a specific energetic, legislative or market scenario does not guarantee good performance when these scenarios change. For this reason, the proposed methodology has been enhanced in order to focus on some innovative aspects. In particular, this study proposes an uncommon and effective approach to identify the most stable plant solutions through a multi objective robust design optimization. In particular, the sensitivity of the expected results to possible difficulties in finding commercially available CHP gas engines with sizes reasonably close to the optimal numerical solutions has been estimated. The results indicate that the economic sensitivity is often higher than the energetic sensitivity for most of the optimal solutions, with standard deviation accounting up to 7% of its mean value for the SPB, whereas that percentage is always under 3% for the TPES. Furthermore, the research highlights how the expected results obtained through a deterministic definition of the input decision variables could be overestimated compared to the robust design approach. The proposed research also highlights how optimized CHP plants can be characterized by reasonable levels of energetic and economic sensitivity to changes in the following variable quantities: selling price of electricity, reference efficiency of the Italian thermoelectric generation and selling price of the energy efficiency certificates recognized by the Italian legislation. Indeed, Pareto optimal solutions indicate that the standard deviation for the SPB is always less than 3.5% of its mean value, while this percentage is always under 7% for the TPES.

"In arsenic-affected regions of Cambodia, rural water committees and planners can choose to promote various arsenic-avoidance and/or arsenic-removal water supply systems. Each of these has different costs of providing water, subsequently born by the consumer in order to be sustainable. On a volumetric basis ($/m3-yr) and of the arsenic-avoidance options considered, small-scale public water supply - e.g., treated water provided to a central tap stand - is the most expensive option on a life-cycle cost basis. Rainwater harvesting, protected hand dug wells, and vendor-supplied water are the cheapest with a normalized present worth value, ranging from $2 to $10 per cubic meter per year of water delivered. Subsidization of capital costs is needed to make even these options affordable to the lowest (Q5) quintile. The range of arsenic-removal systems considered here, using adsorptive media, is competitive with large-scale public water supply and deep tube well systems. Both community level and household-scale systems are in a range that is affordable to the Q4 quintile, though more research and field trials are needed. At a target cost of $5.00/m3, arsenic removal systems will compete with the OpEx costs for most of the arsenic-safe water systems that are currently available. The life-cycle cost approach is a valuable method for comparing alternatives and for assessing current water supply practices as these relate to equity and the ability to pay. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

"Bone is a remarkable living material that comes in two forms with different porosities and different macrostructure, but with the same highly organised microstructure and nanostructure. As bone accumulates damage, it is removed and replaced. When the mechanical demands on bone increase the bone mass increases, while reductions in the loading leads to the removal of bone, thus bone can be considered a 'smart material'. The ongoing replacement of old bone tissue by new bone tissue is called remodelling. Bone formation, repair and remodelling is controlled and produced by four types of cell, namely osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteocytes and bone lining cells. Bone remodelling is regulated by signals to these cells generated by mechanical loading. Exactly how loads are transferred into bone, how the bone cells sense these loads and how the signals are translated into bone formation or removal is unknown. In this review, the structure of bone and the cells responsible for maintaining bone are described. The mechanisms that cause bone to adapt to mechanical loading have been investigated. The methods that have been employed in attempts to determine this mechanism are considered.",103
"Background: Pain catastrophizing (PC) is associated with more severe and disabling migraine attacks. However, factors that moderate this relationship are unknown. Failure of inhibitory control (IC), or the ability to suppress automatic or inappropriate responses, may be one such factor given previous research showing a relationship between higher PC and lower IC in non-migraine samples, and research showing reduced IC in migraine. Therefore, we examined whether lower IC interacts with increased PC to predict greater migraine severity as measured by pain intensity, attack frequency, and duration. Methods: Women (n = 105) aged 18-50 years old (M = 38.0 +/- 1.2) with overweight/obesity and migraine who were seeking behavioral treatment for weight loss and migraine reduction completed a 28-day smartphone-based headache diary assessing migraine headache severity. Participants then completed a modified computerized Stroop task as a measure of IC and self-report measures of PC (Pain Catastrophizing Scale [PCS]), anxiety, and depression. Linear regression was used to examine independent and joint associations of PC and IC with indices of migraine severity after controlling for age, body mass index (BMI) depression, and anxiety. Results: Participants on average had BMI of 35.1 +/- 6.5 kg/m2and reported 5.3 +/- 2.6 migraine attacks (8.3 +/- 4.4 migraine days) over 28 days that produced moderate pain intensity (5.9 +/- 1.4 out of 10) with duration of 20.0 +/- 14.2 h. After adjusting for covariates, higher PCS total (a =.241, SE =.14, p =.03) and magnification subscale (beta =.311, SE =.51, p <.01) scores were significant independent correlates of longer attack duration. IC interacted with total PCS (beta = 1.106, SE =.001, p =.03) rumination (beta = 1.098, SE =.001, p =.04), and helplessness (beta = 1.026, SE =.001, p =.04) subscale scores to predict headache pain intensity, such that the association between PC and pain intensity became more positive at lower levels of IC. Conclusions: Results showed that lower IC interacted with higher PC, both overall and specific subcomponents, to predict higher pain intensity during migraine attacks. Future studies are needed to determine whether interventions to improve IC could lead to less painful migraine attacks via improvements in PC.",127
"Myelofibrosis (MF) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are hematopoietic stem cell disorders associated with cytopenias and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion dependence. Iron overload (IO) as a consequence of RBC transfusion dependence and its effect on outcomes in MF has not been formally studied. However, IO is a demonstrated poor prognostic feature in patients with MDS and congenital or acquired chronic anemias. Evidence that iron chelation therapy (ICT) reduces the deleterious effects of IO in MDS has led to speculation of benefit in MF. However, data supporting the use of ICT in MF is lacking. Neither disease has clear consensus guidelines for the use of ICT. Moreover, JAIL-STAT inhibition, the cornerstone of MF treatment, often contributes to anemia and transfusional requirements.

"Acetochlor [2-chloro-N-(ethoxymethyl)-N-(2-ethyl-6-methyl-phenyl)-acetamide], alachlor [N-(methoxymethyl)- 2-chloro-N-(2,6-diethyl-phenyl)acetamide], butachlor [N-(butoxymethyl)-2-chloro-N-(2,6-diethyl-phenyl)acetamide], and metolachlor [2-chloro-N-(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl)-N-(2-methoxy-1-methylethyl) acetamide] are pre-emergent herbicides used in the production of agricultural crops. These herbicides are carcinogenic in rats: acetochlor and alachlor cause tumors in the nasal turbinates, butachlor causes stomach tumors, and metolachlor causes liver tumors. It has been suggested that the carcinogenicity of these compounds involves a complex metabolic activation pathway leading to a DNA-reactive dialkylbenzoquinone imine. Important intermediates in this pathway are 2-chloro-N-(2-methyl-6-diethylphenyl)acetamide (CDEPA) produced from alachlor and butachlor and 2-chloro-N-(2-methyl-6-ethylphenyl)acetamide (CMEPA) produced from acetochlor and metolachlor. Subsequent metabolism of CDEPA and CMEPA produces 2,6-diethylaniline (DEA) and 2-methyl-6-ethylaniline (MEA), which are bioactivated through para-hydroxylation and subsequent oxidation to the proposed carcinogenic product dialkylbenzoquinone imine. The current study extends our earlier studies with alachlor and demonstrates that rat liver microsomes metabolize acetochlor and metolachlor to CMEPA (0.065 nmol/min/mg and 0.0133 nmol/min/mg, respectively), whereas human liver microsomes can metabolize only acetochlor to CMEPA (0.023 nmol/min/mg). Butachlor is metabolized to CDEPA to a much greater extent by rat liver microsomes (0.045 nmol/min/mg) than by human liver microsomes (< 0.001 nmol/min/mg). We have determined that both rat and human livers metabolize both CMEPA to MEA (0.308 nmol/min/mg and 0.541 nmol/min/mg, respectively) and CDEPA to DEA (0.350 nmol/min/mg and 0.841 nmol/min/mg, respectively). We have shown that both rat and human liver microsomes metabolize MEA (0.035 nmol/min/mg and 0.069 nmol/min/mg, respectively) and DEA (0.041 nmol/min/mg and 0.040 nmol/min/mg, respectively). We have also shown that the cytochrome P450 isoforms responsible for human metabolism of acetochlor, butachlor, and metolachlor are CYP3A4 and CYP2B6.",32
"The representation of minority ethnic communities is an acute issue in many countries in East and Southeast Asia. In Muslim-majority Indonesia, the rise of Jakarta's governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, nicknamed Ahok, was a surprising phenomenon given his ethnic and religious minority status as a Christian of Chinese descent. Even more surprising was his initial success as a politician despite a controversial style of communication that appears to contrast with prevailing cultural norms. We argue that the reason for Ahok's unlikely rise to prominence lay in his ability to reshape the political narrative by shifting the focus of Indonesian-ness away from ethnic or religious identity to moral values based on transparency and integrity. Ethnicity and identity remain powerful forces in Indonesian politics, but we argue that Ahok has established a charismatic relationship with followers by positioning himself in opposition to some of the more pressing concerns in contemporary Indonesia.",66
"The simultaneous three-dimensional (3D) visualization of intracranial tumors, brain structures, skull, and vessels is desired by neurosurgeons to create a clear mental picture of the anatomical orientation of the surgical field prior to the surgical intervention. Different anatomical and pathological components are usually visualized separately on different magnetic resonance (MR) sequences; however, during surgery, they are tackled simultaneously. Another problem is that most present day MR workstations enable review of two-dimensional (2D) slices only with limited postprocessing options. With recent software developments, a simultaneous 3D visualization simulating the real surgical field is possible using commercial or open source softwares. The authors have reviewed the important concepts and described a technique of interactive 3D visualization from routine 3D T1-weighted, MR angiography, and MR venography sequences using open source FSL ( pFunctional MRI of the brain software library) and BrainSuite softwares.",90
"Dishevelled (Dvl) not only links the canonical Wnt and non-canonical Wnt pathways but can also crosstalk with other pathways. As there is no systematic study to date on Dvl in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we explored the impact of Dvl2 on proliferation and inflammatory cytokine secretion in RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs). Expression of Dvl2 in RA synovial tissue and RA-FLSs was measured. Dvl2 was overexpressed in collagen-induced arthritis rats and human RA-FLSs,. the apoptosis and secretion of inflammatory cytokines were observed. Genetic changes and corresponding mechanisms caused by overexpressing Dvl2 in RA-FLSs were assessed. Dvl2 was found to be overexpressed in RA synovial tissue and RA-FLSs. Overexpression of Dvl2 increased apoptosis and inhibited inflammatory cytokine secretion by RA-FLSs in vivo and in vitro, and Dvl2 inhibited expression of antiapoptotic and inflammatory genes. One possible mechanism is that Dvl2 decreases the nuclear translocation of P65 and inhibits its ability to bind to the promoters of NF-kappa B target genes. Our findings reveal an underappreciated role of Dvl2 in regulating inflammation and RA-FLS apoptosis and provide insight into crosstalk between the Wnt and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) pathways.",33
"Sweetpotatoes are important food crops with high starch and high carotene content. However, studies concerning the molecular biology of these crops are limited. In this paper, we selected two varieties of sweetpotato (Zhengshu 20 and Luoxushu 8) for transcriptome analysis. De novo RNA sequencing of these sweetpotatoes (tuberous roots, stems and leaves) under field conditions was performed using an Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform with PE125. Approximately 34.4 G nucleotide bases were sequenced. Following assembly, 176,167 transcripts and 109,401 unigenes were identified. 41,729 (Nr), 21,004 (Nt), 12,524 (KO), 29,444 (SwissProt), 30,212 (PFAM), 31,304 (GO), and 14,349 (KOG) unigenes were functionally annotated using different databases, and a total of 47,749 annotated sequences were identified. Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) analyses revealed 9549 SSR loci on the 8334 unigenes. The KEGG analysis uncovered 55 and 78 unigenes involved in the carotenoid and terpe-noid backbone biosynthesis pathways, respectively. Among these genes, 20 and 10 differentially expressed unigenes were observed in the Zhengshu 20 and Luoxushu 8, respectively. Eight differentially expressed unigenes were validated by qRT-PCR. Thus, we prepared and analyzed the transcriptome data of the two sweetpotato varieties, for which prior genomic information was limited. This new sequence information will improve the current knowledge in this important and healthy crop and provide valuable insight for further biological research. (C) 2017 SAAB.

"We managed a patient with an Epstein-Barr virus-associated T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. Mediastinal tumor cells at initial admission were positive for CD4, CD8, and TdT. Interestingly, a lymph node at necropsy was compatible for a CD4-positive peripheral T-cell lymphoma without CD8 and TdT expression, suggesting a different phenotype from the mediastinal tumor. Tumor cells in pleural effusion continued to proliferate in in vitro and were designated as WILL4. WILL4 cells were positive for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD21, T-cell receptor (TcR) alpha beta, and TdT, indicating a similar phenotype to thymocytes. Southern blot analyses showed that the pleural tumor and WILL4 cells shared a TcR gene rearrangement, and that both contained a clonal EBV genome in an episomal form. RT-PCR showed that EBNA1 and LMP1 were expressed in the fresh tumor and WILL4 cells. Southern blot analyses revealed that WILL4 cells were susceptible to EBV infection in vitro using B95-8 supernatant. Anti-CD21 antibody inhibited in vitro infection of EBV, suggesting that CD21 plays a role in EBV infection into WILL4 cells. In vitro infection of EBV did not affect latent gene expression in WILL4 cells. WILL4 is a useful tool for analyzing the roles of EBV in onocogenesis in immature T-lymphoid malignancies.

"In the present study, we investigated the optimum adsorption conditions, adsorption characteristics and surviva of Lactobacillus acidophilus adsorbed on attapulgite (AIT). Results of single factor experiments showed that the optimum adsorption parameters were AlT concentration of 10%, initial pH of 6.5 and temperature of 35 degrees C. From the static experiments of adsorption characteristics, we found that the experimental data were fitted best to the pseudo-secondorder kinetics and Langmuir isotherm models, and the adsorption was a spontaneous and endothermic process. Bacteria survival test showed that the microencapsulated L. acidophilus stored at -18 degrees C for 30 days achieved the highest survival rate (83.2% +/- 5.8) and obtained better protection at simulated conditions of gastric pH and at high bile salt concentrations when compared with free bacteria. The study demonstrated that microencapsulation of L. acidophilus in ATT was an effective technique of protection against low-temperature injury and under simulated gastrointestinal environment.

"Study Objectives: Many sleep disorders are characterized by increased motor activity during sleep. In contrast, studies on motor activity during physiological sleep are largely lacking. We quantitatively investigated a large range of motor phenomena during polysomnography in physiological sleep. Design: Prospective polysomnographic investigation. Setting: Academic referral sleep laboratory. Participants: One hundred healthy sleepers age 19-77 y were strictly selected from a representative population sample by a two-step screening procedure. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: Polysomnography according to American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) standards was performed, and quantitative normative values were established for periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS), high frequency leg movements (HFLM), fragmentary myoclonus (FM), neck myoclonus (NM), and rapid eye movement (REM)-related electromyographic (EMG) activity. Thirty-six subjects had a PLMS index >5/h, 18 had a PLMS index >15/h (90th percentile: 24.8/h). Thirty-three subjects had HFLM (90th percentile: four sequences/night). All subjects had FM (90th percentile 143.7/h sleep). Nine subjects fulfilled AASM criteria for excessive FM. Thirty-five subjects had NM (90th percentile: 8.8/h REM sleep). For REM sleep, different EMG activity measures for the mentalis and flexor digitorum superficialis muscles were calculated: the 90th percentile for phasic mentalis EMG activity for 30-sec epochs according to AASM recommendation was 15.6%, and for tonic mentalis EMG activity 2.6%. Twenty-five subjects exceeded the recently proposed phasic mentalis cutoff of 11%. None of the subjects exceeded the tonic mentalis cutoff of 9.6%. Conclusion: Quantification of motor phenomena is a basic prerequisite to develop normative values, and is a first step toward a more precise description of the various motor phenomena present during sleep. Because rates of motor events were unexpectedly high even in physiological sleep, the future use of normative values for both research and clinical routine is essential.",128
"This paper presents an 8-bit folding analog-digital converter (ADC) using switched capacitors. In this architecture, the conversion is achieved when the signal crosses a determined voltage level and at this time, a voltage value is added or subtracted from the analog input signal. The ADC proposed consists of eight identical stages that perform the conversion of one bit at a time. Each stage consists of an amplifier circuit with a gain of 2 using switched capacitor. The ADC is designed in 0.35 mu m CMOS (standard technology. When supplied with 3.3 V, the proposed ADC consumes a power of 2.5 mW and presents the following results: conversion time of 100 ns and 45.8 dB of SNDR (Signal to noise plus distortion ratio).",52
"Purpose A blended web-based intervention, ""eHealth module embedded in collaborative occupational health care"" (ECO), aimed at return to work, was developed and found effective in sick-listed employees with common mental disorders. In order to establish the feasibility of ECO, a process evaluation was conducted. Methods Seven process components were investigated: recruitment, reach, dose delivered, dose received, fidelity, satisfaction and context. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to collect data: an online questionnaire for the employees, website data, telephonic interviews with occupational physicians (OPs) and observations of the researchers. Results Recruitment was uncomplicated for the employees, but required several steps for the OPs. Reach was 100 % at the OP level and 76.3 % at the employee level. Dose delivered and received for OPs: 91.6 % received minimally one email message. Dose delivered and received for the employees: finishing of the different modules of ECO varied between 13 and 90 %. Fidelity: the support of the OP to the employee in ECO was lower than anticipated. Satisfaction: both employees and OPs were satisfied with the intervention. However, employees reported a need for more support in ECO. The context showed that OPs had limited time to support the employees and it was impossible for the employee to contact the OP outside their regular contacts. Conclusion Feasibility of ECO and satisfaction of employees and OPs with ECO were good. Fidelity of OPs was limited. For further implementation in the occupational health setting, especially contextual barriers regarding time limitation and accessibility of OPs for employees should be addressed.",69
"In the future, most of the population will settle in large cities and metropolitan areas, in basins where pressure over water resources is already very large. In this situation, the operators of water and sanitation services must make a continuous effort of planning, to reach effective application of the reduced natural and economic resources. However, the urban water systems are composed of many different elements that interact with each other, exhibiting feedback loops and emerging behaviors, so that no simple models could be used. In short, there are complex systems. Under these conditions, decision makers require appropriate methods and tools, such that allow them to examine several alternatives and their impacts in time. The systems approach and adaptive dynamic modeling is one of the most active and promising research fields in water resources management. In this paper the use of dynamic modeling applied to supply water to cities is proposed, a general model is shown and applied to the city of Puebla and its metropolitan area. A trend and a balance scenarios are analyzed, the second composed by a group of conservation, rainwater harvesting and reuse actions over a 15 years horizon, demonstrating the possibility of leading the system from a deficit into a surplus of water, and exemplifying the benefits of dynamic modeling in urban water systems.",95
"Racial inequalities in criminal justice are pressing problems for policymakers. Prior literature suggests elected officials promulgate punitive, racially disparate criminal justice policies due to partisanship and racial fears, but scholarship has yet to explain how and why elected officials address racial problems in criminal processing. This article introduces the framework of racial disparity reform policymaking. A racial disparity reform is a policy that seeks to reduce distinctions in criminal justice institutions' treatment of racial groups. Elected officials pursue these policies due to ideological beliefs in civil rights ideals and political interests in appearing to solve social problems. Using an original database of policy enactments, this article first presents the distribution and types of reform measures adopted by elected officials in all 50 states between 1998 and 2011. It then examines social and political explanations for when state legislatures and executives adopt racial disparity reforms. Policy enactment is predicted by worsening problems of racial disproportion in criminal processing, Democratic control of elected branches, and the absence of judicial efforts to improve racial fairness within a state's criminal justice system. Similar dynamics encourage the development of different measures types within policies. Such ideological and problem-solving explanations for racial disparity reform show a potential for elected officials to forge more racially just criminal justice practices.",81
"OBJECTIVE: Overactive bladder is a syndrome of urinary frequency and urgency, with or without urge incontinence, in the absence of local pathological factors. Since multiple causes are responsible for OAB, it requires proper diagnosis and comprehensive management. For decades, flavoxate is a globally used and accepted molecule by the urologists and the general physicians for the symptomatic treatment of OAB. In spite of its extensive use in OAB, a meta-analysis of the available publications for efficacy, safety and tolerability of flavoxate has not been conducted. This paper evaluates the strength of evidence of clinical effectiveness of safety and tolerability of flavoxate in the symptomatic treatment of OAB. METHODS: Review articles, original studies and case reports on MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Scirus, internal repository, etc. were searched using the keyword ""flavoxate"". For the primary outcome, the comparative data of flavoxate versus comparator was extracted for following parameters-overall efficacy and its side effect profile. Similarly as for secondary outcome, data were extracted for flavoxate per se for overall efficacy, frequency, urinary incontinence, mixed incontinence, nocturia, unpleasant urination, stranguria and its side effect profile and were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software version 2.0. RESULTS: In the current meta-analysis, 43 relevant published studies were considered which clearly demonstrated that flavoxate had improved clinical efficacy than placebo, emepronium, propantheline, and phenazopyridine. CONCLUSIONS: Amongst all the interventions studied, flavoxate was effective and well-tolerated, with almost negligible side effects, making it worthy of consideration for the treatment of OAB.",17
"Thyroid hormones (TH) play a fundamental role in diverse processes, including cellular movement. Cell migration requires the integration of events that induce changes in cell structure towards the direction of migration. These actions are driven by actin remodeling and stabilized by the development of adhesion sites to extracellular matrix via transmembrane receptors linked to the actin cytoskeleton. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that promotes cell migration and invasion through the control of focal adhesion turnover. In this work, we demonstrate that the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3) regulates actin remodeling and cell movement in breast cancer T-47D cells through the recruitment of FAK. T3 controls FAK phosphorylation and translocation at sites where focal adhesion complexes are assembled. This process is triggered via rapid signaling to integrin alpha V/beta 3, Src, phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K), and FAK. In addition, we established a cellular model with different concentration of T3 levels: normal, absence, and excess in T-47D breast cancer cells. We found that the expression of Src, FAK, and PI3K remained at normal levels in the excess of T3 model, while it was significantly reduced in the absence model. In conclusion, these results suggest a novel role for T3 as an important modulator of cell migration, providing a starting point for the development of new therapeutic strategies for breast cancer treatment.",133
"Sphingolipid signaling in Caenorhabditis elegans is vital for sensing environmental change and effecting appropriate cellular response.

"In this study, the experiments aimed at analyzing thermally the exhaust valve in an air-cooled internal combustion engine and estimating the thermal contact conductance in fixed and periodic contacts. Due to the nature of internal combustion engines, the duration of contact between the valve and its seat is too short, and much time is needed to reach the quasi-steady state in the periodic contact between the exhaust valve and its seat. Using the methods of linear extrapolation and the inverse solution, the surface contact temperatures and the fixed and periodic thermal contact conductance were calculated. The results of linear extrapolation and inverse methods have similar trends, and based on the error analysis, they are accurate enough to estimate the thermal contact conductance. Moreover, due to the error analysis, a linear extrapolation method using inverse ratio is preferred. The effects of pressure, contact frequency, heat flux, and cooling air speed on thermal contact conductance have been investigated. The results show that by increasing the contact pressure the thermal contact conductance increases substantially. In addition, by increasing the engine speed the thermal contact conductance decreases. On the other hand, by boosting the air speed the thermal contact conductance increases, and by raising the heat flux the thermal contact conductance reduces. The average calculated error equals to 12.9%.",87

"Bond strength is an important factor in electronic and photonic packaging. Measuring bond characteristics, strength, and fracture toughness is particularly difficult in microelectronic devices where miniaturized bonds are used (e.g., wafer bonding and 3 dimensional integrated circuits). Since applying load directly to the bonds is proven difficult, four-point bending test with notched specimen has been typically used to facilitate fracture toughness measurements at small scale. This method is based on experiencing large peeling and shear stresses at the interface of two layers of different materials at the notch. However, there is a lack of analytical solution that can be used to determine the peeling and shear stresses at the interface of four-point bend specimen. This manuscript presents analytical modeling of peeling and shear stresses in tri-layer four-point bend specimens. Strength of materials approach with the assumption of small strains, within elastic region, is adopted in this study for evaluation of stresses and displacements. Furthermore, beam theory is utilized to develop equations that describe the moments and shear forces in the assembly due to the four-point bending loads. Second and fourth order differential equations are derived for shear and peeling stresses respectively at the interfaces of the assembly. Boundary conditions are determined based on load, supports and shear force and moment diagrams of the assembly. The problem solution is obtained by solving the governing differential equations instantaneously using standard methods. Finite-Element-based simulation is used to compare with and verify the analytical solution. This work also presents an alternative approach where the stresses at the notch are used to determine the fracture toughness. An experiment is conducted on a specimen with inter-metallic material as bond material. The analytical approach is then verified with the results of four-point bending experiment and is validated using the conventional technique (which is based on energy equilibrium and presented by Eq. (60)). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",91
"Background. Preoperative disinfection with povidone-iodine results in a significant reduction of the risk for postoperative endophthalmitis and secondary irreversible vision loss in intraocular surgeries and intravitreal injections. Nevertheless, this important measure is often omitted if so-called ""iodine allergy"" is suspected. We analyze the physiological and allergological basis for the construct of ""iodine allergy"". Methods. This article is based on a selective literature review using the search term ""allergy"" in combination with ""iodine"", ""povidone"", ""indocyanine green"", or ""seafood"". Results. Iodine is a chemical element and an essential component of the human body. Scientific proof for the existence of an antibody-mediated allergic reaction (type I reaction) and in particular an immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated anaphylaxis against iodine is lacking. Chemical irritations and contact allergies (type IV reaction) induced by iodine-containing disinfectants are not antibody-mediated and do not cause anaphylaxis (type I reaction). The uncommon antibody-mediated allergies against iodine-containing disinfectants, fluorescent dyes, radiocontrast media, or seafood are not directed against the contained iodine itself but against other components of the respective formulation. Thus, allergic cross-reactivities between these different substance groups are not to be expected. Conclusion. So-called ""iodine allergy"" is a medical myth lacking a scientific basis and should not result in increased patient risks due to omitted preoperative disinfection.",105
This paper proposes an approach for a robust tracking method to the objects intersection with appearances similar to a target object. The target is image sequences taken by a moving camera in this paper. Tracking methods using color information tend to track mistakenly a background region or an object with color similar to the target object since the proposed method is based on the particle filter. The method constructs the probabilistic background model by the histogram of the optical flow and defines the likelihood function so that the likelihood in the region of the target object may become large. This leads to increasing the accuracy of tracking. The probabilistic background model is made by the density forests. It can infer a probabilistic density fast. The proposed method can process faster than the authors' previous approach by introducing the density forests. Results are demonstrated by experiments using the real videos of outdoor scenes.,90
"This paper presents the possibilities of combing public-key encryption and digital signature algorithms which are actually based on different mathematical hard problems. Since the output of the combination produces an Encrypted signed message. In general, most of the currently used public-key algorithms are computationally expensive with relatively lengthy key requirement due to the dependency on the number theory. Therefore, it's important to show a combinational protocols which are based on different mathematical hard problem. In some sense, difficult to solve. In the combined scheme, we present the powerful and practical encryption digital signature scheme and its security level and execution time.",57
Gene promoters have variable repartition of AGCT nucleotides according to some probabilistic behaviours essentially depending on their position in a string. The paper aims to provide a model for this configuration. With this model we derive non-uniform confidence bounds for those probability distributions in the strings. A uniform bound deriving from previous works in Wu and Zhao [Inference of trends in time series. J R Stat Soc B. 2007; 69: 391-410] is more demanding for the model. A data-based study allows to clarify our suggestions and open the way for applications in molecular biology.,30
"(beta-amyloid (A beta) and tau pathology become increasingly prevalent with age, however, the spatial relationship between the two pathologies remains unknown. We examined local (same region) and non-local (different region) associations between these 2 aggregated proteins in 46 normal older adults using [F-18]AV-1451 (for tau) and [C-11]PiB (for A beta) positron emission tomography (PET) and 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. While local voxelwise analyses showed associations between PiB and AV-1451 tracer largely in the temporal lobes, k-means clustering revealed that some of these associations were driven by regions with low tracer retention. We followed this up with a whole-brain region-by-region (local and non-local) partial correlational analysis. We calculated each participant's mean AV-1451 and PiB uptake values within 87 regions of interest (ROI). Pairwise ROI analysis demonstrated many positive PiB AV-1451 associations. Importantly, strong positive partial correlations (controlling for age, sex, and global gray matter fraction, p <.01) were identified between PiB in multiple regions of association cortex and AV-1451 in temporal cortical ROIs. There were also less frequent and weaker positive associations of regional PiB with frontoparietal AV-1451 uptake. Particularly in temporal lobe ROIs, AV-1451 uptake was strongly predicted by NB across multiple ROI locations. These data indicate that A beta and tau pathology show significant local and non-local regional associations among cognitively normal elderly, with increased PiB uptake throughout the cortex correlating with increased temporal lobe AV-1451 uptake. The spatial relationship between A beta and tau accumulation does not appear to be specific to A beta location, suggesting a regional vulnerability of temporal brain regions to tau accumulation regardless of where AP accumulates.",106
"This paper explores the emergence of joint problem solving in online environments where the participants work together but at different times and from different places. Collaborations of this sort have been referred to as loosely coupled collaborations. The focus is on venue which is the virtual substitute for physical copresence under these conditions. Venue is fundamentally a social construct. It functions to ""localize"" participation dynamics, communication and register, the creation and sharing of domain objects, and situation-dependent knowledge. Within venue, the reflective parts of joint problem solving become more prominent. Within venue, small teams of students align their views, coordinate their efforts, share their understanding and work, and jointly problem solve.",81
"Angiogenesis is an important component of the process of atherosclerosis. It has recently been demonstrated that VEGF, a potent angiogenic growth factor, increases the rate of atherosclerosis in animal models. There is a significant body of literature concerned with the ability of polyphenols to alter VEGF signaling and angiogenesis. However, the potential for polyphenols to influence atherosclerosis as a result of inhibiting VEGF signaling and VEGF-dependent angiogenesis has not been considered. This chapter summarizes and reviews the existing literature concerning the effects of polyphenols on VEGF signaling, angiogenesis, and atherosclerosis. The data suggest that some polyphenols can inhibit VEGF signaling, as well as angiogenesis and atherosclerosis, via a variety of mechanisms and, in some cases, at physiologically relevant concentrations. However, there is a lack of published data from studies with polyphenol metabolites, and the majority of reports are from studies using aglycones at supraphysiological concentrations. Data from epidemiological studies show there is a positive correlation between polyphenol consumption and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, but the role of specific compounds is difficult to determine from these. Future research should focus on establishing whether or not the reported antiatherosclerotic effects of polyphenol-rich foods and extracts are due to the polyphenols inhibiting VEGF signaling. Further research is required to elucidate the influence of bioavailability, metabolism, and combinations of polyphenols found in foods on VEGF signaling.",32
"Integrated bipolar Operational Amplifier (op-amp) type A 741 was irradiated with neutrons and gamma rays. The radiation on gain factors, slew rate, and power supply current have been evaluated. The experimental results show a decrease of these parameter values after exposing to the radiation. The advantage of the increase of the voltage power supplies and the thermal annealing treatment on the damaged parameters was also explored. The relationship among different frequency response parameters is also studied leading to an analytical formula for the above degraded parameters.",60
"This paper reports a method for the simultaneous estimation of unwrapped phase and higher order phase derivatives from a single phase fringe pattern recorded in an optical interferometric setup, thereby overcoming substantial barriers to achieving such measurements. The proposed method considers the interference phase as a weighted linear combination of Gaussian radial basis functions defined along a given row or column at a time. The Gaussian radial basis functions are defined with a constant standard deviation and equally spaced centers. Unscented Kalman filter is employed for the accurate estimation of the weights of the basis functions using the state space representation of the spatial evolution of the interferogram. The estimated weights along with the numerically computed gradients of the basis functions also provide the estimations of phase derivatives of arbitrary order. The proposed representation of interference phase along with the unscented Kalman filter provides high robustness against the speckle noise. Simulation study is preformed to evaluate the dependence of the phase and phase derivative estimation accuracy on the selection of basis dimension and the noise level. Experimental results demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed method.",58
"Monitoring deformation of super-tall structures under different environmental conditions is an important and challenging issue in assessing the safety and serviceability of structures. This paper presents a new method for calculating structural deformation using real-time strain data, which can be easily measured at different sections. Assuming the structural deformation is of bending beam type, the deformation of the structure is associated with longitudinal strain. Virtual work theory is then used to calculate the horizontal displacement and tilt angle of the building on the basis of the strain data at different heights of the structure. The proposed method is applied to the 600 m tall Canton Tower (previously known as Guangzhou New TV Tower), on which a long-term structural health monitoring system including over 400 vibrating strain gauges has been installed at different heights. The displacements and tilts of the structure top under normal and typhoon conditions are calculated using real-time monitoring strain data. The calculated deformations show good agreement with the measurements by using global positioning system (GPS) and inclinometers. The temperature-induced maximum daily movement is similar to the value of typhoon-induced motion. Moreover, the displacement mode of the super-tall structure is also calculated and shows the bending type. Error analysis demonstrates that the calculated displacements have higher accuracy than the GPS-measured counterparts, and that the calculated tilts have similar accuracy as those measured by an inclinometer.

"Due to the diversity of geographical objects, it makes great sense to introduce multiscale segmentation/representation into the analysis and interpretation of high-spatial-resolution remote sensing images. However, with the increasing use of high-resolution images, traditional multiscale segmentation methods gradually show their lack in efficiency, particularly when handling large-scale images. In this paper, a novel bilevel scale-sets model (BSM) is proposed for multiscale region-based representation of large-scale remote sensing images. In the BSM, first, an image is divided into blocks with overlapped margins, and a low-level scale-sets model is blockwisely implemented. Second, a segmentation result is obtained by retrieving and mosaicking the blockwise segmentation results, based on which a high-level scale-sets model is implemented covering the whole image. To further improve the efficiency of the BSM, a parallel implementation is presented for the blockwise scale-sets model. In the experiments, first, the effectiveness of the BSM is validated using a WorldView2 image covering a coastal area of Shenzhen, where the BSM obtains accurate multiscale representation results without any mosaic artifacts. Then, the efficiency of the BSM is demonstrated by comparing with the state-of-the-art multiscale segmentation method, i.e., the one integrated in the commercial software eCognition v9.2, where the proposed BSM takes about 7 min to process a 24 000 x 24 000 multispectral ZY3 image and is two to three times faster than the competing method.",101
"Purpose: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder that often leads to complications. We aimed to correlate two complications of DM, polyneuropathy and hyperactive bladder syndrome, using noninvasive measures, such as screening tests. Methods: We included 80 female and 40 male type 2 diabetic patients in this prospective study. Diabetic polyneuropathy evaluations were conducted using the Douleur Neuropathique 4 Questions (DN4), and overactive bladder (OAB) evaluations were performed using the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-V8). The patients were also evaluated for retinopathy and nephropathy. The diabetic male and female patients with or without OAB were chosen and compared for microvascular complications (polyneuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy). Results: There were no significant correlations between OAB and retinopathy as well as between OAB and nephropathy among diabetic patients (female patients, P >0.05; male patients, P >0.05). However, the patients with OAB were significantly more likely to develop polyneuropathy (female patients, P < 0.05; male patients, P < 0.05). Conclusions: In diabetic patients, OAB and diabetic peripheral neuropathy are significantly correlated. These correlations were demonstrated using short, understandable, valid, and reliable disease-specific tests without invasive measures. Using these screening tests, both neurologists and urologists can easily diagnose these complications.",17
"Purpose: To characterize outer retina structure in best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) and to determine the effect of macular lesions on overlying and adjacent photoreceptors. Methods: Five individuals with BVMD were followed prospectively with spectral domain optical coherence tomography and confocal and nonconfocal split-detector adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO). The AOSLO cone photoreceptor mosaic images were obtained within and around retinal lesions. Cone density was measured inside and outside lesions. In 2 subjects, densities were compared with published measurements acquired similar to 2.5 years before. One subject was imaged 3 times over a 5-month period. Results: The AOSLO imaging demonstrated that photoreceptor morphology within BVMD retinal lesions was highly variable depending on the disease stage, with photoreceptor structure present even in advanced disease. The AOSLO imaging was repeatable even in severe disease over short-time and long-time intervals. Photoreceptor density was normal in retinal areas immediately adjacent to lesions and stable over similar to 2.5 years. Mobile disk-like structures possibly representing subretinal macrophages were also observed. Conclusion: Combined confocal and nonconfocal split-detector AOSLO imaging reveals substantial variability within clinical lesions in all stages of BVMD. Longitudinal cellular photoreceptor imaging could prove a powerful tool for understanding disease progression and monitoring emerging therapeutic treatment response in inherited degenerations such as BVMD.",34
"This paper provides empirical evidence regarding the causal effects that upgrading slum dwellings has on the living conditions of the extremely poor. In particular, we study the impact of providing better houses in situ to slum dwellers in El Salvador, Mexico and Uruguay. We experimentally evaluate the impact of a housing project run by the NGO TECHO (""roof""), which provides basic pre-fabricated houses to members of extremely poor population groups in Latin America. The main objective of the program is to improve household well-being. Our findings show that better houses have a positive effect on overall housing conditions and general well-being: the members of treated households are happier with their quality of life. In two countries, we also document improvements in children's health; in El Salvador, slum dwellers who have received the TECHO houses also feel that they are safer. We do not find this result, however, in the other two experimental samples. There are no other noticeable robust effects in relation to the possession of durable goods or labor outcomes. Our results are robust in terms of both their internal and external validity because they are derived from similar experiments in three different Latin American countries.

"he present work aimed to develop a novel composite material made up of activated cow bone powder (CBP) as a starting material for reducing chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) from palm oil mill effluent (POME). The optimization of the reduction efficiency was investigated using response surface methodology (RSM). Six independent variables used in the optimization experiments include pH (4-10), speed (0.27-9.66 rcf), contact time (2-24 h), particle size (1-4.35 mm), dilution factor (100-500) and adsorbent dosage (65-125 g/L). The chemical functional groups were determined using Fourier transform irradiation (FTIR). The elemental composition were detected using SEM-EDX, while thermal decomposition was investigated using thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) in order to determine the effects of carbonization temperature on the adsorbent. The results revealed that the optimal reduction of COD and NH3-N from raw POME was observed at pH 10, 50 rpm, within 2 h and 3 mm of particle size as well as at dilution factor of 500 and 125 g L-1 of adsorbent dosage, the observed and predicted reduction were 89.60 vs. 85.01 and 75.61 vs. 74.04%, respectively for COD and NH3-N. The main functional groups in the adsorbent were OH, N-H, C=O, C=C, C-O-C, C-O-H, and CH. The SEM-EDX analysis revealed that the CBP-composite has a smooth surface with high contents of carbon. The activated CBP has very stable temperature profile with no significant weight loss (9.85%). In conclusion, the CBP-composite investigated here has characteristics high potential for the remediation of COD and NH3-N from raw POME. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",121
"Introduction: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects nearly 170 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of progressive liver damage, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Curative therapies have historically relied on interferon-based treatments and were limited by significant toxicity and poor response rates, particularly among patients with prior treatment failure and advanced hepatic fibrosis. The recent advent of direct acting antiviral (DAA) agents which target key steps in the HCV viral life cycle has transformed the landscape of HCV treatment by offering highly effective and well tolerated interferon-free treatments. However, current therapies are genotype-specific and have variable efficacy amongst less prevalent HCV variants.Areas covered: This review covers the preclinical and clinical development of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL), an interferon-free, once daily, pangenotypic treatment for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. All relevant literature from 2014 through September of 2016 is included.Expert opinion: SOF/VEL offers the promise of a single tablet, interferon- and ribavirin-free treatment that has extremely high efficacy in persons with chronic HCV infection regardless of genotype, subtype, treatment history or fibrosis status. It is expected to play a major role on a global scale in the therapeutic armamentarium against this ubiquitous threat to human health.",130

"With growing population in urban areas, the problem of lacking space is becoming more prominent. Thus, the development of underground space has increasingly gained attention as a viable solution. Social aspects, such as social behavior and attitudes toward underground spaces could act as both facilitators and inhibitors toward the adoption of underground spaces. Here we review, present and discuss the major social parameters associated with working in underground spaces. Our research overview identified three major themes that pervade existing literature: attitudes and perception; social behavior; and the impact of environmental attributes of underground spaces. Yet, we also notice that the social and cultural elements associated with underground spaces have remained largely unexplored, with previous research being of more of a qualitative character and, to some extent, outdated. We thus subsequently identified the major unexplored themes and present an organized, systematic research program for a more holistic and quantifiable understanding of the interaction between social behavior and underground spaces. We end by discussing how this research program can be integrated with other disciplines, including engineering, design and health. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",71
"The main result of this paper is a simulation algorithm which, under quite general constraints, transforms algorithms running in the Congested Clique model into algorithms running in the MapReduce model. As a case study of applying this simulation algorithm, we first present a distributed O (Delta)-coloring algorithm running on the Congested Clique in O (1) rounds, if Delta >= log(2) n, and O (log log logn) rounds otherwise. Applying the simulation theorem to this Congested Clique O (A)-coloring algorithm yields an O(1)-round O (Delta)-coloring algorithm in the MapReduce model. We apply our simulation algorithm to other Congested Clique algorithms including the 2-ruling set and metric facility location algorithms of Berns et al. (ICALP 2012). Our simulation algorithm illustrates a natural correspondence between per-node bandwidth in the Congested Clique model and memory per machine in the MapReduce model. In the Congested Clique (and more generally, any network in the CONGEST model), the major impediment to constructing fast algorithms is the O (logn) restriction on message sizes. Similarly, in the MapReduce model, the combined restrictions on memory per machine and total system memory have a dominant effect on algorithm design. In showing a fairly general simulation algorithm, we highlight the similarities and differences between these models. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",35
"Amino acids present a great potential for heavy metals sorption, thanks to their active chemical groups. Tyrosine is an amino acid containing amine, carboxylate and phenol groups and thus is a potential candidate for heavy metals remediation. However, this biomolecule is water soluble, and so it is difficult to remove tyrosine-metal complexes from the water. A potential solution would consist in grafting this biomolecule onto a material to ensure a good separation between heavy metals, trapped by tyrosine-grafted-material, and the water medium. Thus, the grafting of tyrosine onto a polypropylene (PP) nonwoven was carried out. Evidence of the grafting of tyrosine was given by several characterization techniques: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. A 3.2% tyrosine grafting rate was obtained. Then, the sorption efficiency of the tyrosine-functionalized material was evaluated by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. At 20 degrees C and for pH 4.5, approximately 48 mg of copper per gram of PP were trapped, confirming the good efficiency of tyrosine. The most interesting result of this study is the constant sorption capacity whatever the sodium chloride concentration in the copper sulfate solution. This result, specific to tyrosine, allows considering the possibility of the use of such material for marine wastewaters and sediments depollution. This article contains supporting information that will be made available online once the issue is published.",93
"Persistent hyperglycemia, impairment of redox status and establishment of inflammatory pathophysiology integrally play important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DC). Present study examined the therapeutic potential of protocatechuic acid isolated from the Sansevieria roxburghiana rhizomes against DC employing rodent model of type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D was induced by high fat diet + a low-single dose of streptozotocin (35 mg/kg, i.p.). T2D rats exhibited significantly (p < 0.01) high fasting blood glucose level. Alteration in serum lipid profile (p < 0.01) and increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase (p < 0.01) and creatine kinase (p < 0.01) in the sera of T2D rats revealed the occurrence of hyperlipidemia and diabetic pathophysiology. A significantly (p < 0.01) high levels of serum C-reactive protein and pro-inflammatory mediators revealed the establishment of inflammatory occurrence in T2D rats. Besides, significantly high levels of troponins in the sera revealed the establishment of cardiac dysfunctions in T2D rats. However, protocatechuic acid (50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) treatment could significantly reverse the changes in serum biochemical parameters related to cardiac dysfunctions. Molecular mechanism studies demonstrated impairment of signaling cascade, IRS1/PI3K/Akt/AMPK/p 38/GLUT4, in glucose metabolism in the skeletal muscle of T2D rats. Significant (p < 0.01) activation of polyol pathway, enhanced production of AGEs, oxidative stress and up-regulation of inflammatory signaling cascades (PKC/NF-B-k/PARP) were observed in the myocardial tissue of T2D rats. However, protocatechuic acid (50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) treatment could significantly (p < 0.05-0.01) stimulate glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle, regulated glycemic and lipid status, reduced the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and restored the myocardial physiology in T2D rats near to normalcy. Histological assessments were also in agreement with the above findings. In silico molecular docking study again supported the interactions of protocatechuic acid with different signaling molecules, PI3K, IRS, Akt, AMPK PKC, NF-B-k and PARP, involved in glucose utilization and inflammatory pathophysiology. In silico ADME study predicted that protocatechuic acid would support the drug-likeness character. Combining all, results would suggest a possibility of protocatechuic acid to be a new therapeutic agent for DC in future.",120
"Introduction: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent neurological disorder in children characterized by restrictive, repetitive patterns of behavior that place an added burden on everyday functions. Aerobic exercise has the propensity to reduce stereotypic behaviors in children with ASD. This study sought to quantify the acute effect of exercise and to assess the influence of duration and intensity on the frequency of stereotypic behaviors in children with ASD. Methods: Participants in this study (N = 7, M-age = 13.0 +/- 1.4 yr, M-height = 1.64 +/- 0.01 m, and M-weight = 60.1 +/- 13.7 kg) underwent five separate days of treatments, including a control condition (C), a low-intensity 10-min condition (10L), a high-intensity 10-min condition (10H), a low-intensity 20-min condition (20L), and a high-intensity 20-min condition (20H) in which intensity was quantified using HR as well as RPE. Before and 60 min after exercise, the frequency of stereotypic behaviors was recorded. Results: Results indicated a reduction in behaviors in response to exercise compared with the C trial throughout all conditions except 20H. Interestingly, the most exhaustive exercise session led to increased stereotypic behaviors at all postexercise periods compared with the other exercise trials (P < 0.10). The 10L condition showed the greatest reduction at 60 min postexercise compared with the 20H or the control trial"" s response (P < 0.05). Examining the behavioral responses to exercise using effect sizes indicated the 10L condition showed the greatest reduction in frequency throughout all four time points (ESrange = -0.87 to -1.03) compared with baseline. Conclusion: Although it appears high-intensity aerobic exercise may exacerbate stereotypic behaviors in children with ASD, low-to moderate-intensity exercise produces significant and large reductions in these behaviors. This provides an easily administered and cost-effective way to positively impact these individuals.",113
"Despite Latino youth being at increased risk of developing mental health problems, they are less likely to receive adequate treatment (Gonzales et al. in Handbook of U.S. Latino psychology: developmental and community-based perspectives. Sage, Thousand Oaks, pp 115-134, 2009; Romero et al. in Ethn Health 12(5):443-463, 2007; Smokowski et al. in J Community Psychol 37(8):1024-1045, 2009; Flores in Pediatrics 125(4):e979-e1020, 2010). Better understanding of the factors that influence psychosocial outcomes for Latino youth is crucial to addressing existing mental health disparities. In order to build on existing knowledge of factors that promote positive mental health outcomes for Latino youth, the current study examined sociocultural influences on Latino early adolescents' global self-worth. In particular, researchers investigated the effects of acculturation and acculturation risk factors on early adolescents' perceptions of global self-worth. Seventy-nine Latino early adolescents completed a series of questionnaires assessing behavioral and cognitive aspects of acculturation (i.e., ethnic culture of origin, US mainstream culture, and biculturalism), acculturation risk factors (i.e., acculturation stress, acculturation conflict, and perceived ethnic discrimination), and global self-worth. Results suggested that specific cultural orientations were associated with increased global self-worth, and increased levels of acculturation risk factors were associated with decreased global self-worth. Acculturation conflict was the most salient predictor of global self-worth, and regression analyses indicated that the effects of acculturation stress, acculturation conflict, and perceived ethnic discrimination on global self-worth depended on youth's cultural orientation on the behavioral and cognitive measures of acculturation. Results indicate the importance of assessing both cognitive and behavioral aspects of acculturation, as well as the way in which acculturation moderates the relation between acculturation risk factors and early adolescents' perceptions of global self-worth.",125

"This paper presents a method to solve - in real time the three dimensional workspace generation problem for arbitrary serial manipulators. Our approach is based on Monte Carlo simulation, to process a high number of forward kinematics with randomly chosen joint values. This results in an asymptotic coverage of the reachable workspace. Additionally, collision detection is integrated to consider obstacles within the manipulator's environment. The method is implemented on the graphics processing unit (GPU), such that an extremely high number of workspace points can be processed in parallel. Tests have shown that this approach is capable to generate acceptable workspace coverage within milliseconds. Furthermore, the workspace is held as a three dimensional texture volume on the graphics memory, allowing for instant visualisation of the workspace during the generation process without the need for further time-intensive data exchange.",79

"Designing fast and scalable algorithm for mining frequent itemsets is always being a most eminent and promising problem of data mining. Apriori is one of the most broadly used and popular algorithm of frequent itemset mining. Designing efficient algorithms on MapReduce framework to process and analyze big datasets is contemporary research nowadays. In this paper, we have focused on the performance of MapReduce based Apriori on homogeneous as well as on heterogeneous Hadoop cluster. We have investigated a number of factors that significantly affects the execution time of MapReduce based Apriori running on homogeneous and heterogeneous Hadoop Cluster. Factors are specific to both algorithmic and nonalgorithmic improvements. Considered factors specific to algorithmic improvements are filtered transactions and data structures. Experimental results show that how an appropriate data structure and filtered transactions technique drastically reduce the execution time. The non-algorithmic factors include speculative execution, nodes with poor performance, data locality & distribution of data blocks, and parallelism control with input split size. We have applied strategies against these factors and fine tuned the relevant parameters in our particular application. Experimental results show that if cluster specific parameters are taken care of then there is a significant reduction in execution time. Also we have discussed the issues regarding MapReduce implementation of Apriori which may significantly influence the performance.",41
"Recently, graphene foam (GF) with a three-dimensional (3D) interconnected network produced by template-directed chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been used to prepare composite phase-change materials (PCMs) with enhanced thermal conductivity. However, the pore size of GF is as large as hundreds of micrometers, resulting in a remarkable thermal resistance for heat transfer from the PCM inside the large pores to the GF strut walls. In this study, a novel 3D hierarchical GF (HGF) is obtained by filling the pores of GF with hollow graphene networks. The HGF is then used to prepare a paraffin wax (PW)-based composite PCM. The thermal conductivity of the PW/HGF composite PCM is 87% and 744% higher than that of the PW/GF composite PCM and pure PW, respectively. The PW/HGF composite PCM also exhibits better shape stability than the PW/GF composite PCM, negligible change in the phase-change temperature, a high thermal energy storage density that is 95% of pure PW, good thermal reliability, and chemical stability with cycling for 100 times. More importantly, PW/HGF composite PCM allows light-driven thermal energy storage with a high light-to-thermal energy conversion and storage efficiency, indicating its great potential for applications in solar-energy utilization and storage.",100
"Background: Chronic stress has been shown to be associated with disease. This link is not only direct but also indirect through harmful health behavior such as smoking or changing eating habits. The recent mHealth trend offers a new and promising approach to support the adoption and maintenance of appropriate stress management techniques. However, only few studies have dealt with the inclusion of evidence-based content within stress management apps for mobile phones. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate stress management apps on the basis of a new taxonomy of effective emotion-focused stress management techniques and an established taxonomy of behavior change techniques. Methods: Two trained and independent raters evaluated 62 free apps found in Google Play with regard to 26 behavior change and 15 emotion-focused stress management techniques in October 2015. Results: The apps included an average of 4.3 behavior change techniques (SD 4.2) and 2.8 emotion-focused stress management techniques (SD 2.6). The behavior change technique score and stress management technique score were highly correlated (r=.82, P=.01). Conclusions: The broad variation of different stress management strategies found in this sample of apps goes in line with those found in conventional stress management interventions and self-help literature. Moreover, this study provided a first step toward more detailed and standardized taxonomies, which can be used to investigate evidence-based content in stress management interventions and enable greater comparability between different intervention types.",29
"The transcription factor c-Myb is involved in the control of cell proliferation, survival and differentiation. As these processes accompany the morphogenesis of developing teeth, this work investigates the possible role of c-Myb during odontogenesis. Analysis of the expression of c-Myb in the monophyodont mouse was followed by similar analysis in a diphyodont species, the pig, which has a dentition more closely resembling that of the human. The distribution of c-Myb was correlated with the pattern of proliferation and apoptosis and the tooth phenotype of c-Myb mutant mice was also assessed. In the mouse, c-Myb expression was detected throughout prenatal development of the first molar tooth. Negative temporospatial correlation was found between c-Myb expression and apoptosis, while c-Myb expression positively correlated with proliferation. c-Myb-positive cells, however, were more abundant than the proliferating cell nuclear antigen positive cells, suggesting other roles of c-Myb in odontogenesis. In the minipig, in contrast to the mouse, there was an asymmetrical arrangement of c-Myb positive cells, with a higher presence on the labial side of the tooth germ and dental lamina. A cluster of negative cells was situated in the mesenchyme close to the tooth bud. At later stages, the number of positive cells decreased and these cells were situated in the upper part of the dental papilla in the areas of future cusp formation. The expression of c-Myb in both species was strong in the odontoblasts and ameloblasts at the stage of dentin and enamel production suggesting a possible novel role of c-Myb during tooth mineralization.",75
This paper presents a high accuracy and high bandwidth current sense circuit for digitally controlled DC-DC buck converters. The circuit uses lossless inductor DCR current sensing and a sigma delta modulator ADC to sense the average current in the inductor to high accuracy. These accurate but low bandwidth measurements are unsuitable for use in feedback control loops as their acquisition delay would limit the achievable loop bandwidth. To solve this issue a Kalman Filter estimates the inductor current at the switching frequency of the converter. The output of the estimator is shown through experimental results to achieve 0.3A static current accuracy when used in a buck converter switching at 1MHz and using a power efficient inductor with a DCR of only 165 mu Ohms.,48
"Introduction: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a behavioral syndrome caused by a developmental disorder, biologically determined, with onset in the first three years of life. The areas concerned are mainly those related to social communication, social interaction and mutual functional and symbolic play. In the last decades, different conceptions of autism have taken, also emphasizing different sensory-perceptual abnormalities as the basis of the central features of disorder. This pilot study intends to address the issue of sensory perception in preschool children affected by ASD. Material and methods: 11 ASD children were enrolled (7 males, 4 female) aged between 2.3 years and 4.6 years, (mean age 3.29 +/- 0.72). The control group consisted of 24 typical developing children (15 males, 9 females) (mean age 3.08 +/- 0.87). All subjects underwent assessment of sensory perceptual abilities according to the Bogdashina's Sensory Profile Checklist Revised (SPCR) evaluation (43). Results: The two groups are comparable for age (p = 0.491) and sex distribution (p = 0.755). Table 1 shows the comparison between the two groups results in the SPCR, specifically, individuals with ASD, showed significantly higher scores on near all perception areas evaluated than healthy controls, suggesting a clear perceptual impairment in ASD subjects. Only for olfactory perception two groups were comparable. Conclusions: no significant differences in behavioral reaction to smell stimulation between ASD and typical developing children, and this result could be explained according to the early age of our sample that could cause high reactivity to smell stimulation also in typical developing examined children.",10
"A signal- and transient-current boosting (STCB) circuit is proposed and applied to a single-stage amplifier driving large capacitive loads. The proposed STCB circuit provides gain-bandwidth product (GBW) extension, slew-rate (SR) improvement and gain enhancement to the amplifier, with only slight alterations to the frequency response and transient response of the single-stage amplifier driving large capacitive loads. No on-chip capacitor or resistor is required. The STCB amplifier is fabricated in a commercial 0.18-mu m CMOS technology. The active chip area is 0.00705 mm(2). The supply is 1.8 V, and the current consumption is 20.3 mu A. The capacitive load (C-O) ranges from about 4.4 nF to 19 nF. The measured results with a similar to 19-nF load show the small-signal figure-of-merit (FOMS = GBW . C-O/power) and the large-signal large-figure-of-merit (FOML = SR . C-O/power) are 150345 MHz . pF/mW and 31213 V/mu s . pF/mW, respectively, which correspond to improvements of 1.52 times and 1.36 times, respectively, to the prior art. The achieved phase margin and gain margin are 80.8 degrees and 36.3 dB, respectively.",60
"OBJECTIVE: To use novel geographic methods and large-scale claims data to identify the local distribution of pediatric chronic diseases in New York City. METHODS: Using a 2009 all-payer emergency claims database, we identified the proportion of unique children aged 0 to 17 with diagnosis codes for specific medical and psychiatric conditions. As a proof of concept, we compared these prevalence estimates to traditional health surveys and registry data using the most geographically granular data available. In addition, we used home addresses to map local variation in pediatric disease burden. RESULTS: We identified 549,547 New York City children who visited an emergency department at least once in 2009. Though our sample included more publicly insured and uninsured children, we found moderate to strong correlations of prevalence estimates when compared to health surveys and registry data at prespecified geographic levels. Strongest correlations were found for asthma and mental health conditions by county among younger children (0.88, P =.05 and 0.99, P <.01, respectively). Moderate correlations by neighborhood were identified for obesity and cancer (0.53 and 0.54, P <.01). Among adolescents, correlations by health districts were strong for obesity (0.95, P =.05), and depression estimates had a nonsignificant, but strong negative correlation with suicide attempts (-0.88, P =.12). Using SaTScan, we also identified local hot spots of pediatric chronic disease. CONCLUSIONS: For conditions easily identified in claims data, emergency department surveillance may help estimate pediatric chronic disease prevalence with higher geographic resolution. More studies are needed to investigate limitations of these methods and assess reliability of local disease estimates.",109
"Progesterone produced by the corpus luteum (CL) regulates the synthesis of various endometrial proteins required for embryonic implantation and development. Compromised CL progesterone production is a potential risk factor for prenatal development. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play diverse roles in mammalian reproductive biology. ROS-induced oxidative damage and subsequent adverse developmental outcomes constitute important issues in reproductive medicine. The CL is considered to be highly exposed to locally produced ROS due to its high blood vasculature and steroidogenic activity. ROS-induced apoptotic cell death is involved in the mechanisms of CL regression that occurs at the end of the non-fertile cycle. Luteal ROS production and propagation depend upon several regulating factors, including luteal antioxidants, steroid hormones and cytokines, and their crosstalk. However, it is unknown which of these factors have the greatest contribution to the maintenance of CL integrity and function during the oestrous/menstrual cycle. There is evidence to suggest that antioxidants play important roles in CL rescue from luteolysis when pregnancy ensues. As luteal phase defect impacts fertility by preventing implantation and early conceptus development in livestock and humans, this review attempts to address the importance of ROS-scavenging antioxidant enzymes in the control of mammalian CL function and integrity.

"Traditionally, testosterone and estrogen have been considered to be male and female sex hormones, respectively. However, estradiol, the predominant form of estrogen, also plays a critical role in male sexual function. Estradiol in men is essential for modulating libido, erectile function, and spermatogenesis. Estrogen receptors, as well as aromatase, the enzyme that converts testosterone to estrogen, are abundant in brain, penis, and testis, organs important for sexual function. In the brain, estradiol synthesis is increased in areas related to sexual arousal. In addition, in the penis, estrogen receptors are found throughout the corpus cavernosum with high concentration around neurovascular bundles. Low testosterone and elevated estrogen increase the incidence of erectile dysfunction independently of one another. In the testes, spermatogenesis is modulated at every level by estrogen, starting with the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis, followed by the Leydig, Sertoli, and germ cells, and finishing with the ductal epithelium, epididymis, and mature sperm. Regulation of testicular cells by estradiol shows both an inhibitory and a stimulatory influence, indicating an intricate symphony of dose-dependent and temporally sensitive modulation. Our goal in this review is to elucidate the overall contribution of estradiol to male sexual function by looking at the hormone's effects on erectile function, spermatogenesis, and libido.",6
"This paper explains the reason for the difference in maximum torque-speed characteristics and power factor of IM between motor and generator modes and investigates the influence of machine design parameters on the difference, such as stator resistance, rotor resistance and iron loss etc. An analytical mathematical model based on the dq reference frame is employed for investigation. It is shown that the difference in torque-speed characteristics between motor and generator modes is mainly caused by the opposite direction of q-axis current and affected by stator resistance value. Finally, analytically calculated torque-speed characteristics of a 12kW IM in motor and generator modes are verified by finite element analyses.",85
"Over the past few years, a new era of smart connected devices has emerged in the market to enable the future world of the Internet of Things (IoT). A key requirement for IoT applications is the power consumption to allow very high autonomy in the case of battery-powered systems. Depending on the application, such devices will be most of the time in a low-power mode (sleep mode) and will wake up only when there is a task to accomplish (active mode). Emerging non-volatile memory technologies are seen as a very attractive solution to design ultra-low-power systems. Among these technologies, magnetic random access memory is a promising candidate, as it combines non-volatility, high density, reasonable latency, and low leakage. Integration of non-volatility as a new feature of memories has the great potential to allow full data retention after a complete shutdown with a fast wake-up time. This article explores the benefits of having a non-volatile processor to enable ultra-low-power IoT devices.",51
"Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is involved in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. We investigated the effects of ET-1 on intracellular calcium transient and its mechanisms. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were prepared and calcium transient was measured using fura-2. Treatment with ET-1 for 48 h prolonged calcium transient decay. In the presence of thapsigargin, ET-1 did not alter calcium transient decay. On the other hand, the prolonged calcium transient decay was maintained even when sodium was removed from the bath solution. These results indicate that ET-1-induced prolongation of calcium transient decay is mainly due to the suppression of calcium uptake by sarcoplasmic reticulum, but not inhibition of the sodium/calcium exchanger. Northern blotting analysis revealed that sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA2) mRNA was decreased in ET-1-treated cardiomyocytes, and that this decrease was inhibited by BQ-123 but not by BQ-788. Moreover, pretreatment with chelerythrine partially restored the ET-1-induced decrease in SERCA2 mRNA, whereas phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate markedly reduced SERCA2 gene expression. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed abundant ETA receptor gene expression in cardiomyocytes. ET-1 reduces SERCA2 gene expression through the ETA receptor and PKC pathway, and prolongs intracellular calcium transient decay. Specific inhibition of the ETA receptor may be a possible therapeutic strategy for improving cardiac performance.",38
"The lungs are constantly exposed to the external environment, which in addition to harmless particles, also contains pathogens, allergens, and toxins. In order to maintain tolerance or to induce an immune response, the immune system must appropriately handle inhaled antigens. Lung dendritic cells (DCs) are essential in maintaining a delicate balance to initiate immunity when required without causing collateral damage to the lungs due to an exaggerated inflammatory response. While there is a detailed understanding of the phenotype and function of immune cells such as DCs in human blood, the knowledge of these cells in less accessible tissues, such as the lungs, is much more limited, since studies of human lung tissue samples, especially from healthy individuals, are scarce. This work presents a strategy to generate detailed spatial and phenotypic characterization of lung tissue resident DCs in healthy humans that undergo a bronchoscopy for the sampling of endobronchial biopsies. Several small biopsies can be collected from each individual and can be subsequently embedded for ultrafine sectioning or enzymatically digested for advanced flow cytometric analysis. The outlined protocols have been optimized to yield maximum information from small tissue samples that, under steady-state conditions, contain only a low frequency of DCs. While the present work focuses on DCs, the methods described can directly be expanded to include other (immune) cells of interest found in mucosal lung tissue. Furthermore, the protocols are also directly applicable to samples obtained from patients suffering from pulmonary diseases where bronchoscopy is part of establishing the diagnosis, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), sarcoidosis, or lung cancer.",33
"Background Infusion-related reactions (IRRs) are a major adverse event of rituximab. Objective To develop a prediction model for IRRs to rituximab among patients with B cell non- Hodgkin's lymphomas (B-NHL). Setting A 1000-bed university hospital in Tokyo. Methods Patients with B-NHL treated with rituximab at our institution from 2004 to 2014 were retrospectively analysed. Chills, fever, rash, nausea, asthenia, headache, cardiovascular symptoms, and respiratory symptoms of any grade, in association with rituximab infusion, were identified as IRRs. Risk factors for IRRs to rituximab found in the intergroup analysis were subsequently evaluated by using multivariate analysis. Main outcome measure Occurrence of IRRs to rituximab. Results A total of 140 patients with various types of B-NHL, including 74% with diffuse large Bcell lymphoma, were analysed. Among them, 55 and 85 patients were assigned to the IRR group and the non-IRR group, respectively. Indolent histological subtypes, bulky disease (>10 cm), B symptoms, higher serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor concentration, and bone marrow involvement were more common in the IRR group. The multivariate logistic regression analysis identified low-grade lymphomas [odds ratio (OR) 2.81, p = 0.017] and bulky disease (OR 2.52, p = 0.037) as independent risk factors for IRRs to rituximab. The incidence rates of IRRs to rituximab among patients with neither, one, or both of these risk factors were 26, 54, and 78%, respectively (chi(2) = 16.4, p < 0.001). Conclusions A simple combination of histopathological subtype and bulkiness of disease could predict the risk of IRRs to rituximab among patients with B-NHL.",127
"Objective: To examine outcomes of clinical procedures for renal angiomyolipoma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) based on US national health claims databases.Methods: This retrospective cohort study selected two cohorts of TSC patients, who underwent either embolization or nephrectomy (either partial or complete) for renal angiomyolipoma in the years from 2000 through 2011. Based on claims diagnosis codes, we estimated the prevalence rates of 10 angiomyolipoma-related conditions and 50 embolization- or nephrectomy-related conditions in the pre- and post-baseline periods respectively, and made cross-year and cross-period comparison of these rates with repeated measures analysis methods.Results: The embolization cohort (N=4280) and the nephrectomy cohort (N=3842) had mean baseline ages of 50.7 and 51.7 years with 52.5% and 51.3% males, respectively. After the intervention, the embolization cohort had statistically significant reductions (all p<.05) in gross hematuria (-27.7%), retroperitoneal hemorrhage (-8.4%), and abdominal mass (-6.9%), and increases in hypertension (15.5%), renal mass or unspecified disorder of kidney and ureter (13.8%), anemia (5.1%), and renal insufficiency (3.3%). Similarly, the nephrectomy cohort saw statistically significant reductions (all p<.05) in gross hematuria (-30.6%), flank pain (-7.5%), and abdominal mass (-6.4%), but increases in hypertension (11.9%), renal insufficiency (10.4%), and anemia (7.6%). Embolization was associated with post-procedure increases in renal mass or unspecified kidney/ureter disorder (13.9%), other disorders of kidney and ureter (3.4%), non-acute renal insufficiency (3.1%), flank pain (3.7%), renal insufficiency (3.2%), etc. (all p<.05). Nephrectomy was associated with post-procedure increases in postoperative ileus (5.3%), pain and headache (4.8%), paralytic ileus (3.6%), etc. (all p<.05).Conclusions: Both embolization and nephrectomy were effective, but associated with increases in certain angiomyolipoma-related conditions. Further, the embolization effect on gross hematuria, retroperitoneal hemorrhage, and abdominal mass might subside after the intervention year.",127
"Voltage inverters are the most common kind of actuator to interface with variable frequency electrical systems. They are usually driven by a modulation block that provides the gating signals for the switches. Direct digital control avoids the modulation block, being the gating signals directly produced by the controller. In such configuration, the control of the electrical system is a discrete time and quantized-actuation problem. This paper analyzes the harmonic content in sinusoidal steady state resulting from such configuration. The analysis illustrates the higher harmonic content, providing lower bounds for such content in the case of low ratios of commutation to fundamental frequencies. Also, the dependence of harmonic content with duty cycle and with commutation losses is exposed. The findings apply to different kind of control structures, regardless of its design or tuning parameters. Some of them are experimentally compared. A two-level three-phase inverter is used in the analysis for its relevance and simplicity although the procedure can be applied to any number of phases or levels.

"beta-lapachone (1) has entered phases I and II clinical trials for the treatment of solid tumors and the therapeutic efficacy of beta-lapachone is closely related to its metabolic process. In order to contribute to a better understanding of human metabolism of beta-lapachone, Cunninghamella elegans ATCC 10028b was used as a microbial model of mammalian metabolism to biotransform beta-lapachone and two new glycosylated derivatives were produced. The chemical structures were elucidated as 6-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-naphtho[1,2-b]pyran-5-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (2) and 5-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-naphtho[1,2-b]pyran-6-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (3) by H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, HMBC, HMQC, COSY and HRMS analyses. The major derivative (3) displayed a lower activity against breast cancer cell line SKBR-3 (IC50 = 312.5 mu M) than beta-lapachone (IC50 = 5.6 mu M), but did not show cytotoxicity against normal fibroblasts cell line GM07492-A, whereas beta-lapachone was highly toxic (IC50 = 7.25 mu M). These metabolites were reported here for the first time and are similar to those that occur in phase II of human metabolism (C) 2013 Phytochemical Society of Europe. Published by Elsevier B.V.

"In the present work, we applied a new control strategy of power systems based on a technique for classifying areas of an electrical network (generators, lines, etc.) taking into account both margins variations of variables given state and secondly, the impact of various faults each weighted by its probability of occurrence.

"Response inhibition has been suggested to be dysfunctional in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, this process involves intentional cognitive control, which does not correspond to the automatic emergence of stereotyped thoughts and behaviours usually reported by patients with OCD. In the present study, the excessive facilitation of unintentional processes was assessed in OCD by using the Computerized Mirror Pointing Task (CMPT). Seventy-six volunteers participated in this study, including 39 patients with OCD and 37 healthy controls. The CMPT was administered to all participants, and a score of appropriateness of the sensorimotor adaptation to the mirror inversion was computed from the initial deviation angle (IDA), that precedes the intentional readjustment of movement. Results showed that throughout the 40 trials of the CMPT, the IDA score remained significantly abnormal in patients with OCD in comparison with control participants. Further analyses of IDA scores in OCD revealed a clear tendency to keep a natural visuomotor processing that is rigid and unadapted to the mirror condition. Irrespective of the physical requirements of the environment, patients with OCD showed a strong tendency to initiate movements as per a previously consolidated - although unadapted- sensorimotor mapping. This suggests a tendency for an excessive facilitation of unintentional stereotyped processes. Further studies should be conducted on this question by using tasks sensitive to cognitive processes other than visuo-spatial abilities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",108
"Interstitial-free steel workpieces are deformed by equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) for equivalent strain epsilon(vm) = 3 and epsilon(vm) = 21 followed by flash annealing. Microstructures are analyzed by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Mechanical properties are evaluated by hardness testing. Yield strength of materials is calculated from hardness values. Flash annealing (at 675 A degrees C) of ECAPed samples for epsilon(vm) = 3 and epsilon(vm) = 21 results in abnormal subgrain growth and abnormal grain growth, respectively. Flash annealing at 700 A degrees C of ECAPed (at epsilon(vm) = 3) IF steel converts abnormally grown subgrains to grains which serve as nuclei for recrystallization and that result in bimodal grain size distribution. Bimodal grain size distribution is also produced when ECAPed IF steel for epsilon(vm) = 21 is flash annealed at 675 A degrees C due to abnormal grain growth or secondary recrystallization. Flash annealing of IF steel samples ECAPed for low epsilon(vm), in the temperature range 600-675 A degrees C, decreases the hardness continuously with increase in the annealing temperature but it increases at high epsilon(vm). The former is due to annihilation of defects but the later is caused by ordering of nonequilibrium boundaries. The hardening and strengthening behaviors are similar.",91
This paper presents a digital Active Gate Drive (AGD) methodology for power semiconductor devices. The inherent latency limitation of digital signal processing systems is addressed by a sequential optimization procedure that uses voltage and current signals recorded at the previous switching edge to develop an optimized gate drive waveform for the next switching edge. Experimental results using a half-bridge circuit operating at 180 V/100 A show that the proposed scheme is capable of minimizing switching losses whilst constraining the overvoltage peaks occurring at turn-on and turn-off to as low as 200 V and 300 V respectively.,48
"In this work, the WRF meteorological model is run in three different modes to estimate the wind energy potential in the Bay of Biscay for the 1990-2001 period. The first simulation (NODA) involves a typical use of the WRF model and it does not use data assimilation. The second one (12hDA) performs 3DVAR data assimilation at 00 UTC and 12 UTC. Finally, 6hDA uses 3DVAR data assimilation at 00 UTC, 06 UTC, 12 UTC and 18 UTC. Verification for the three simulations has been carried out at a preliminary stage using wind data from buoys, and then a spatially distributed analysis has been conducted of surface wind based on satellite data from the Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform (CCMP). To that purpose, the spatial correlation and error patterns over our study area have been used as statistical indicators. The results indicate that the wind values obtained with data assimilation every six hours (6hDA) yield the best verification scores at a 95% confidence level, thereby being the most accurate at reproducing wind observations in the area. Regarding the estimation of wind energy potential, at a second stage, we tested the calculation's sensitivity to the use of data assimilation. The most reliable simulation with data assimilation (6hDA) estimates 21% less energy potential than the simulation without data assimilation. In the absence of historical wind observation records of the sea with sufficient time and space resolution, meteorological models such as WRF provide an estimation of the wind values in tentative areas for offshore wind farms. In this line, our study highlights the need to use meteorological models with data assimilation, as future wind energy production can then be more realistically estimated beforehand. This may also contribute to a more accurate economic and technical evaluation of the risks and benefits for future investments in offshore wind energy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",86
"This study aims at assessing the technical and economic benefits of refurbishing existing public housing villas in the UAE. Four representative federal public housing villas built between 1980s and 2010s were modeled and analyzed. The Integrated Environmental Solutions-Virtual Environment (IES-VE) energy modeling software was used to estimate the energy consumption and savings due to different refurbishment configurations applied to the villas. The refurbishment technical configurations were based on the UAE's Estidama green buildings sustainability assessment system. The refurbishment configurations include upgrading three elements: the wall and roof insulation as well as replacing the glazing. The annual electricity savings results indicated that the most cost-efficient refurbishment strategy is upgrading of wall insulation (savings up to 20.8 %) followed by upgrading the roof's insulation (savings up to 11.6 %) and lastly replacing the glazing (savings up to 3.2 %). When all three elements were refurbished simultaneously, savings up to 36.7 % were achieved (villa model 670). The savings translated to CO2 emission reduction of 22.6 t/year. The simple and discounted payback periods for the different configurations tested ranged between 8 and 28 and 10 and 50 years, respectively.",43
"Many recent software engineering papers have examined duplicate issue reports. Thus far, duplicate reports have been considered a hindrance to developers and a drain on their resources. As a result, prior research in this area focuses on proposing automated approaches to accurately identify duplicate reports. However, there exists no studies that attempt to quantify the actual effort that is spent on identifying duplicate issue reports. In this paper, we empirically examine the effort that is needed for manually identifying duplicate reports in four open source projects, i.e., Firefox, SeaMonkey, Bugzilla and Eclipse-Platform. Our results show that: (i) More than 50 % of the duplicate reports are identified within half a day. Most of the duplicate reports are identified without any discussion and with the involvement of very few people; (ii) A classification model built using a set of factors that are extracted from duplicate issue reports classifies duplicates according to the effort that is needed to identify them with a precision of 0.60 to 0.77, a recall of 0.23 to 0.96, and an ROC area of 0.68 to 0.80; and (iii) Factors that capture the developer awareness of the duplicate issue's peers (i.e., other duplicates of that issue) and textual similarity of a new report to prior reports are the most influential factors in our models. Our findings highlight the need for effort-aware evaluation of approaches that identify duplicate issue reports, since the identification of a considerable amount of duplicate reports (over 50 %) appear to be a relatively trivial task for developers. To better assist developers, research on identifying duplicate issue reports should put greater emphasis on assisting developers in identifying effort-consuming duplicate issues.",123
"ObjectiveThe focus of this communication was to study phospholipid-structured emulsions whose phase behaviour is modified with monoalkyl fatty amphiphiles. Ideally, these systems would mimic key physical and structural attributes observed in human stratum corneum (SC) so that they better alleviate xerotic skin conditions. MethodsPhosphatidylcholine-structured emulsions were prepared, and their phase behaviour modified with monoalkyl fatty amphiphiles. The effect of molecular volume, acyl chain length and head-group interactions was studied using a combination of physical methods. Water vapour transmission rate (WVTR) was used as a primary test to assess occlusive character. Changes in the vibrational modes observed in Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and bilayer spacing measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD) were then applied to elucidate the lateral and lamellar microstructural characteristics in the systems. ResultsWater vapour transmission rate demonstrated that as the phosphatidylcholine acyl chain length increased from C14, to C18, to C22, there was a corresponding increase in occlusive character. The addition of monoalkyl fatty amphiphiles such as behenic acid, behenyl alcohol or cetostearyl alcohol to a base formulation incorporating dipalmitoyl and distearoylphosphatidylcholine (C18) was seen to further increase barrier characteristics of the emulsions. FTIR methods used to probe lipid-chain conformational ordering demonstrated that as phosphatidylcholine acyl chain lengths increased, there was a corresponding improvement in acyl chain ordering, with an increase in thermal transition temperatures. The addition of a monoalkyl fatty amphiphile resulted in conformational order and thermal transition temperature improvements trending towards those observed in stratum corneum. FTIR also demonstrated that systems containing behenic acid or behenyl alcohol exhibited features associated with orthorhombic character. X-ray diffraction data showed that addition of monoalkyl fatty amphiphile also resulted in thicker lamellar structures than when those agents are not present. ConclusionThe generalized approach described herein is shown to mechanistically describe the occlusive character of phospholipid-structured formulations in the presence of long-chain fatty acids or alcohols and that they exhibit characteristics mimicking those found in human SC lipids. Resume ObjectifL'objectif de cette communication est l'etude des emulsions structurees aux phospholipides - dont le comportement de phase est modifie par des amphiphiles gras monoalkyles. Idealement, ces systemes pourraient imiter les attributs physiques et structurels cles observes dans le stratum corneum humain (SC) afin qu'ils puissent mieux alleger les conditions xerotiques de la peau. MethodesDes emulsions structurees a la phosphatidylcholine ont ete preparees et leur comportement de phase modifies avec des amphiphiles gras monoalkyle. Les effets du volume moleculaire, de la longueur de chaine acyle et des interactions des tetes ont ete etudies en utilisant une combinaison de methodes physiques. Le taux de transmission de la vapeur d'eau (WVTR) a ete utilise comme critere principal pour evaluer le caractere occlusif. Les changements dans les modes vibratoires observes dans la transformee de Fourier infra-rouge (FTIR) et l'espacement des bicouches mesure par diffraction des rayons X (XRD) ont ensuite ete utilises pour elucider les micro-structures caracteristiques laterales et lamellaires dans le systems. ResultatsLa WVTR a demontre que, lorsque la longueur de la chaine acyle de la phosphatidylcholine est passee de C14 a C18 puis a C22 il y avait une augmentation correspondante du caractere occlusif. L'addition d'amphiphiles gras monoalkyle tels que l'acide behenique, l'alcool behenique ou l'alcool cetostearylique a une formulation de base incorporant la distearylphosphatidylcholine (C18) augmente encore les caracteristiques de barriere des emulsions.

"It has been shown in vitro that only specific dietary fibers contribute to immunity, but studies in vivo are not conclusive. Here, we investigated degree of polymerization (DP) dependent effects of beta 2 ->1-fructans on immunity via microbiota-dependent and-independent effects. To this end, conventional or germ-free mice received short-or long-chain beta 2 ->1-fructan for 5 days. Immune cell populations in the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs), and Peyer's patches (PPs) were analyzed with flow cytometry, genome-wide gene expression in the ileum was measured with microarray, and gut microbiota composition was analyzed with 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples. We found that beta 2 ->1-fructans modulated immunity by both microbiota and microbiota-independent effects. Moreover, effects were dependent on the chain-length of the beta 2 ->1-fructans type polymer. Both short-and long-chain beta 2 ->1-fructans enhanced T-helper 1 cells in PPs, whereas only short-chain beta 2 ->1-fructans increased regulatory T cells and CD11b(-)CD103(-)dendritic cells (DCs) in the MLN. A common feature after short-and long-chain beta 2 ->1-fructan treatment was enhanced 2-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase 2 expression and other IL-22-dependent genes in the ileum of conventional mice. These effects were not associated with shifts in gut microbiota composition, or altered production of short-chain fatty acids. Both short-and long-chain beta 2 ->1-fructans also induced immune effects in germ-free animals, demonstrating direct effect independent from the gut microbiota. Also, these effects were dependent on the chain-length of the beta 2 ->1-fructans. Short-chain beta 2 ->1-fructan induced lower CD80 expression by CD11b(-)CD103(-) DCs in PPs, whereas long-chain beta 2 ->1-fructan specifically modulated B cell responses in germ-free mice. In conclusion, support of immunity is determined by the chemical structure of beta 2 ->1-fructans and is partially microbiota independent.",33
"BACKGROUND: The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends universal osteoporosis screening among women ages 65+ and targeted screening of younger women, but historically, adherence to these evidence-based recommendations has been suboptimal. METHODS: To describe contemporary patterns of osteoporosis screening, we conducted a retrospective analysis using the OptumLabs(TM) Data Warehouse, a database of de-identifiedadministrative claims, which includes medical and eligibility information for over 100 million Medicare Advantage and commercial enrollees. Study participants included 1,638,454 women ages 50+ with no prior history of osteoporosis diagnosis, osteoporosis drug use, or hip fracture. Osteoporosis screening during the most recent 2-year period of continuous enrollment was assessed via medical claims. Patient sociodemographics, comorbidities, and utilization of other services were also determined using health insurance files. RESULTS: Overall screening rates were low: 21.1%, 26.5%, and 12.8% among women ages 50-64, 65-79, and 80+ years, respectively. Secular trends differed significantly by age (P < .001). Between 2008 and 2014, utilization among women ages 50- 64 years declined 31.4%, changed little among women 65-79, and increased 37.7% among women 80+ years. Even after accounting for socioeconomic status, health status, and health care utilization patterns, non-Hispanic black women were least likely to be screened, whereas non-Hispanic Asian and Hispanic women were most likely to undergo screening. Marked socioeconomic gradients in screening probabilities narrowed substantially over time, decreasing by 44.5%, 71.9%, and 59.7% among women ages 50-64, 65-79 and 80+ years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant changes in utilization of osteoporosis screening among women ages 50-64 and 80+, in line with national recommendations, tremendous deficiencies among women 65+ remain.

"Aims Movement time analyzer (MTA) is an objective instrument to evaluate the degree of motor impairment as well as to investigate the dopaminergic drug effect in Parkinson's disease patients. The aim of this study is to validate a new ecologic neuroimaging tool for quantifying MTA-related hemodynamic response of the cortical motor system by means of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Materials 11 right-handed healthy volunteers (six male and five female, age range 27-64 years) were studied with fNIRS and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing MTA task for each hand. Results MTA performance was better for the dominant hand and younger participants. Both fNIRS and fMRI analyses revealed MTA-related increase of haemoglobin levels in the primary motor and premotor cortices contralateral to the moving hand. This response progressively increased with aging. Conclusion These findings supported the translation of fNIRS-based MTA behavioural tool in clinical practice.",19
"Using the Developmental Play Assessment, this preliminary study described the categories and levels of play with objects produced by 10 young boys with diagnoses of full mutation fragile X syndrome, the leading inherited cause of intellectual disability. Additionally, the study examined concurrent associations between child characteristics and three different summary level variables representing object play skills. Presentation Combinations (i.e., recreating structured configurations of objects) was the highest play level emerging or mastered for all participants. The number of toys touched during the play sample, an index of object interest, was positively related to standardized measures of receptive and expressive language while the number of different actions produced, an index of play diversity, was negatively related to autism symptom severity. Both variables were significantly related to the number of nonverbal communication acts children produced while interacting with their mothers in play. Clinical implications and future directions are discussed. Learning outcomes: Readers will be able to: (1) define a framework for categorizing developmental levels of play; (2) discuss the constructs represented by three different summary level metrics of play with objects; (3) describe the relationship between object-play skills and child characteristics for young males with FXS.

"Mindfulness-based interventions such as the Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) programme are increasingly applied to enhancing patients' stress management and problem solving skills, and to preventing and treating mental disorders. However, its generalisability to psychosocial counseling remains uncertain. The aim was to examine whether an abbreviated MBSR-based mindfulness stress-reduction-training (MST) provided in a counseling context has a positive impact on mindfulness, quality of life, stress and depressive symptoms. The psychosocial counseling centre at the TU Chemnitz conducted a randomised-controlled pilot study (N = 28), comparing MST (6 weekly sessions at 2 hours) with a waiting-list control group before, after and 3 months after treatment. MST-participants displayed a higher quality of life, fewer dysfunctional and more functional stress management strategies and fewer depressive symptoms than control participants. The potential of MST could be realized successfully in a short, cost-effective version of the MBSR programme and achieve a positive impact on stress management, quality of life and depression. Providing MST in the context of treatment or (psychosocial) counseling may address shortages in health service provision.",29
"Particularly in claim disputes concerning delay in construction time caused by the client based on the VOB/B there is no consistent opinion concerning the consideration of the appropriate amount of general costs in the claims; mainly because this issue is quite complex with legal, cost theoretical and construction business management characteristics to be considered. After explaining the essential construction business management characteristics as well as the main legal and construction management principles in [1, 2], in this paper two new methods of estimating general costs in claim requests will be presented - the manufacturing costs/construction time method and the capacity utilization method. In a successive second paper both new methods will be validated and compared with two main, already in the practice existing methods concerning the cost evaluation of general costs. As result and in contradiction to the current practice general costs should not be considered in claims without additional construction time entitlement according to 2 clause 5 and 6 VOB/B. In contrast, additional construction time entitlement according to 6 clause 6 VOB/B should lead further to general costs, which depend on the relation of the additional contractual construction time to the original construction time under consideration of a correction factor.",102
"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of sperm motility enhancers and different IVF times on cleavage, polyspermy, blastocyst formation, embryo quality and hatching ability. In Experiment 1, sex-sorted X chromosome-bearing Bos taurus spermatozoa were incubated for 30min before 18h fertilisation with hyperactivating factors, namely 10mM caffeine (CA), 5mM theophylline (TH), 10mM caffeine and 5mM theophylline (CA+TH); and untreated spermatozoa (control). In Experiment 2, matured B. taurus oocytes were fertilised using a short (8h) or standard (18h) fertilisation length, comparing two different fertilisation media, namely synthetic oviducal fluid (SOF) fertilisation medium (SOF-FERT) and M199 fertilisation medium (M199-FERT). Cleavage and blastocyst formation rates were significantly higher in the CA+TH group (77% and 27%, respectively) compared with the control group (71% and 21%, respectively). Cleavage rates and blastocyst formation were significantly lower for the shortest fertilisation time (8h) in M199-FERT medium (42% and 12%, respectively). The SOF-FERT medium with an 8h fertilisation time resulted in the highest cleavage rates and blastocyst formation (74% and 29%, respectively). The SOF-FERT medium produced the highest embryo quality (50% Grade 1) and hatching rate (66%). Motility enhancers did not affect polyspermy rates, whereas polyspermy was affected when fertilisation length was extended from 8h (3%) to 18h (9%) and in M199-FERT (14%) compared with SOF-FERT (6%). We conclude that adding the motility enhancers CA and TH to sex sorted spermatozoa and Tyrode's albumin lactate pyruvate (TALP)-Sperm can improve cleavage and embryo development rates without increasing polyspermy. In addition, shortening the oocyte-sperm coincubation time (8h) resulted in similar overall embryo performance rates compared with the prolonged (18h) interval.",31
"Substrate nanotopography has been shown to be a potent modulator of cell phenotype and function. To dissect nanotopography modulation of cell behavior, a large area of nanopatterned substrate is desirable so that enough cells can be cultured on the nanotopography for subsequent biochemical and molecular biology analyses. However, current nanofabrication techniques have limitations to generate highly defined nanopatterns over a large area. Herein, we present a method to expand nanopatterned substrates from a small, highly defined nanopattern to a large area using stitch technique. The method combines multiple techniques, involving soft lithography to replicate poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) molds from a well-defined mold, stitch technique to assemble multiple PDMS molds to a single large mold, and nanoimprinting to generate a master mold on polystyrene (PS) substrates. With the PS master mold, we produce PDMS working substrates and demonstrate nanotopographical modulation of cell spreading. This method provides a simple, affordable yet versatile avenue to generate well-defined nanopatterns over large areas, and is potentially extended to create micro-/nanoscale devices with hybrid components.",30

Therefore, we have reviewed 75 published studies associated with research topic among Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, involving studies on the roles of food ingredients and oil type, cooking style impacting on generated pollutants, and human health. The highest concentration occurred including: 1) when peat, wood, and raw coal were used in stoves; 2) olive oil was adopted; 3) cooking with high temperatures; and 4) without cleaning technology. We conclude that PM concentrations for cooking emissions were between 0.14 and 24.46 mg/cm(3). VOC concentrations varied from 0.35 to 3.41 mg/m(3). Barbeque produced the greatest mass concentrations compared to Sichuan cuisine, canteen and other restaurants. The PAH5 concentration emitted from the exhaust stacks, dining area and kitchen ranged from 0.0175 mu g/m (3) to 83 mu g/m(3). The largest amount of gaseous pollutants emitted was recorded during incomplete combustion of fuel or when a low combustion efficiency (CO2/ (CO + CO2) < 0.5) was observed. The variation range was 6.27-228.89 mg/m(3), 0.16-0.80 mg/m(3), 0.69-4.33 mg/m(3), 0.70-21.70 mg/m(3) for CO, CO2, NO2 and SO2 respectively. In regards to the toxicity and exposure, current findings concluded that both the dose and exposure time are significant factors to be considered. Scientific research in this area has been mainly driven by comparison among emissions from various ingredients and cooking techniques. There is still a need for more comprehensive studies to fully characterise the cooking emissions including their physical and chemical transformations which is crucial for accurate estimation of their impacts on the environment and human health.

"In emotion regulation research, it is common to distinguish adaptive from maladaptive emotion regulation strategies. However, little is known about their interactional impact (compensational or interfering effects) on adolescents' adjustment. We collected longitudinal, multiple informant questionnaire data from N = 608 adolescents and their parents to examine the prevalence of adolescents' anger regulation profiles using latent profile analysis. We identified five anger regulation profilesan adaptive, a maladaptive, a low, a medium, and an undefined profile. The first three profiles could be replicated 1 year later, as could one additional multiple and another undefined profile. Findings supported the assumption that adaptive strategies compensate for the negative impact of maladaptive strategies, yielding negative psychosocial consequences, particularly for the maladaptive profiles. Moreover, different profiles were divergently related to adolescents' internalizing and externalizing problems concurrently and over time. Results highlight the importance of considering both adaptive and maladaptive anger regulation strategies in prevention and psychotherapy.",65
"The findings of an extensive literature survey focusing on bridge structural health monitoring (SHM) deployments are presented. Conventional, maturing, and emerging technologies are reviewed as well as deployment considerations for new SHM endeavors. The lack of published calibration studies (and quantification of uncertainty studies) for new sensors is highlighted as a major concern and area for future research. There are currently very few examples of SHM systems that have clearly provided significant value to the owners of monitored structures. The results of the literature survey are used to propose a categorization system to better assess the potential outcomes of bridge SHM deployments. It is shown that SHM studies can be categorized as one (or a combination) of the following: (1) anomaly detection, (2) sensor deployment studies, (3) model validation, (4) threshold check, and (5) damage detection. The new framework aids engineers specifying monitoring systems to determine what should be measured and why, hence allowing them to better evaluate what value may be delivered to the relevant stakeholders for the monitoring investments.",97
"Accurately and reliably tracking the undulatory motion of deformable fish body is of great significance for not only scientific researches but also practical applications such as robot design and computer graphics. However, it remains a challenging task due to severe body deformation, erratic motion and frequent occlusions. This paper proposes a tracking method which is capable of tracking the midlines of multiple fish based on midline evolution and head motion pattern modeling with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The midline and head motion state are predicted using two LSTM networks respectively and the predicted state is associated with detections to estimate the state of each target at each moment. Experiment results show that the system can accurately track midline dynamics of multiple zebrafish even when mutual occlusions occur frequently.",79
"Aims Epidemiological studies strongly suggest a link between stress, depression, and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs); the mechanistic correlation, however, is poorly understood. A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the BDNF gene (BDNFVal66Met), associated with depression and anxiety, has been proposed as a genetic risk factor for CVD. Using a knock-in mouse carrying the BDNFVal66Met human polymorphism, which phenocopies psychiatric-related symptoms found in humans, we investigated the impact of this SNP on thrombosis. Methods and results BDNFMet/Met mice displayed a depressive-like phenotype concomitantly with hypercoagulable state and platelet hyper-reactivity. Proteomic analysis of aorta secretome from BDNFMet/Met and wild-type (WT) mice showed differential expression of proteins involved in the coagulation and inflammatory cascades. The BDNF Met allele predisposed to carotid artery thrombosis FeCl3-induced and to death after collagen/epinephrine injection. Interestingly, transfection with BDNFMet construct induced a prothrombotic/proinflammatory phenotype in WT cells. SIRT1 activation, using resveratrol and/or CAY10591, prevented thrombus formation and restored the physiological levels of coagulation and of platelet markers in BDNFMet/Met mice and/or cells transfected with the Met allele. Conversely, inhibition of SIRT1 by sirtinol and/or by specific siRNA induced the prothrombotic/proinflammatory phenotype in WT mice and cells. Finally, we found that BDNF Met homozygosity is associated with increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in humans. Conclusion Activation of platelets, alteration in coagulation pathways, and changes in vessel wall protein expression in BDNFMet/Met mice recapitulate well the features occurring in the anxiety/depression condition. Furthermore, our data suggest that the BDNFVal66Met polymorphism contribute to the individual propensity for arterial thrombosis related to AMI.",69
"CHILDREN WITH DEAFBLINDNESS need support to be able to understand the world and to have access to information. The authors analyzed a dyad consisting of a child with congenital deafblindness and a specialized teacher. The study included participant observations and audiovisual recordings. It was found that the child showed attention to the teacher in activities involving music and rhythm. As potential forms of nonverbal communication, the child presented vocalization, touch, body contact, body movements, facial expressions, and tears. The teacher's forms of communication were verbal, touch, visual, rhythm, and sign language. It was concluded that a significant communication partner is essential to identify, interpret, and respond to attention and communicative behaviors. Use of other forms of communication must comply with individual characteristics so that the child with deafblindness can receive information from the environment through these senses and thus be guaranteed access to the world.",64
"Myoclonus in Parkinson's disease (PD) may be related or unrelated to dopaminergic medication and may share some features of cortical myoclonus. The aim of this study was to analyze clinical and electrophysiological correlates of the dopaminergic treatment unrelated myoclonus in PD patients. We included 17 PD patients with the end-of-dose myoclonus and 16 PD patients without myoclonus between January 2010 and June 2011. Surface electromyography of upper extremity muscles and long latency reflexes (LLRs) were performed. Positive or negative myoclonus with a duration of 35-100 ms was observed. Rest tremor was less frequent in the group with myoclonus. Only one PD patient with myoclonus had C reflex. Mean LLR amplitude was significantly high in PD with myoclonus compared to the group without myoclonus (p = 0.024). Dopaminergic treatment unrelated myoclonus is less related to rest tremor in PD, may be positive or negative, and exhibits similar features to cortical myoclonus.",19
"Seasonal affective disorder, which is underdiagnosed in the primary care setting, is a mood disorder subtype characterized by episodic major depression that typically develops in winter when daylight hours are short. Patients with SAD experience increased morbidity and decreased quality of life. This article focuses on recognition and management of this condition. Light therapy is the preferred treatment for SAD because it is safe and easy to administer; light therapy may be combined with pharmacologic therapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) also has a positive therapeutic effect when combined with light therapy and may help prevent SAD in subsequent seasons.",71
"In boost converters and other indirect energy transfer topologies, transient-oriented controllers are designed to facilitate a dynamic response that may range from minimum time up to minimum output voltage deviation. Since analytical definitions for these control laws can become quite complex, a large-signal stability verification is not immediate. This paper explores the existence of stability of indirect energy transfer converters that are controlled by either boundary or hybrid controllers and introduces a new simplified procedure for examination of large-signal stability of a given converter and load type using a graphical-analytical approach. The stability analysis and examination method are demonstrated on a boost converter loaded by resistive load and constant current load. The stability conditions are verified using a 30 W 3.3-to-12 V boost converter prototype, controlled by a programmable-deviation controller and time-optimal controller, verifying their large-signal stability.",48
"The functional outcome of schizophrenia is heterogeneous and markers of the course are missing. Functional outcome is associated with social cognition and negative symptoms. Gesture performance and nonverbal social perception are critically impaired in schizophrenia. Here, we tested whether gesture performance or nonverbal social perception could predict functional outcome and the ability to adequately perform relevant skills of everyday function (functional capacity) after 6 months. In a naturalistic longitudinal study, 28 patients with schizophrenia completed tests of nonverbal communication at baseline and follow-up. In addition, functional outcome, social and occupational functioning, as well as functional capacity at follow-up were assessed. Gesture performance and nonverbal social perception at baseline predicted negative symptoms, functional outcome, and functional capacity at 6-month follow-up. Gesture performance predicted functional outcome beyond the baseline measure of functioning. Patients with gesture deficits at baseline had stable negative symptoms and experienced a decline in social functioning. While in patients without gesture deficits, negative symptom severity decreased and social functioning remained stable. Thus, a simple test of hand gesture performance at baseline may indicate favorable outcomes in short-term follow-up. The results further support the importance of nonverbal communication skills in subjects with schizophrenia.",64
"In vitro manipulation of human stem cells is a critical process in regenerative medicine and cellular therapies. Strategies and methods to maintain stem cells and direct them into specific lineages are ongoing challenges in these fields. To date, a number of studies have reported that besides biochemical stimulation, biophysical cues in the form of surface patterning and external stimulation also influence stem cell attachment, proliferation, and differentiation, and can be used in cell reprogramming and the maintenance of pluripotency. While biochemical cues are generally effective and easy to deliver, biophysical cues have many other advantages for scalability as they are cost efficient, have a longer lifetime, and can be easily defined. However, different protocols and cell sources utilized in a variety of studies have led to difficulties in obtaining clear conclusions about the effects of the biophysical environment on stem cells. In addition, the examination of different types of external stimulation is time consuming and limited by available fabrication techniques, resulting in a delay in commercialization and clinical applications. In this review, we aim to summarize the most important biophysical cues and methods for the culture of human stem cells, including mesenchymal and pluripotent stem cells, to facilitate their adoption in stem cell biology. The standard classical protocols of using biochemical cues will also be discussed for comparison. We believe that combining biochemical and biophysical stimulation has the greatest potential to generate functionally mature cells at a scalable and inexpensive rate for diverse applications in regenerative medicine and cell therapy.

"There is current interest in harnessing the combined anticancer and immunological effect of nano particles (NPs) and RNA. Here, we evaluate the bioactivity of poly I:C (pIC) RNA, bound to anticancer zinc oxide NP (ZnO-NP) against melanoma. Direct RNA association to unfunctionalized ZnO-NP is shown by observing change in size, zeta potential, and absorption/fluorescence spectra upon complexation. RNA corona was visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for the first time. Binding constant (K-b = 1.6-2.8 g(-1) L) was determined by modified Stern-Volmer, absorption, and biological surface activity index analysis. The pIC ZnO-NP complex increased cell death for both human (A375) and mouse (B16F10) cell lines and suppressed tumor cell growth in BALB/C-B16F10 mouse melanoma model. Ex vivo tumor analysis indicated significant molecular activity such as changes in the level of phosphoproteins JNK, Akt, and inflammation markers IL-6 and IFN-gamma. High throughput proteomics analysis revealed zinc oxide and poly I:C-specific and combinational patterns that suggested possible utility as an anticancer and immunotherapeutic strategy against melanoma.",33
"Today's commercially available word processors allow people to write collaboratively in the cloud, both in the familiar asynchronous mode and now in synchronous mode as well. This opens up new ways of working together. We examined the data traces of collaborative writing behavior in student teams' use of Google Docs to discover how they are writing together now. We found that student teams write both synchronously and asynchronously, take fluid roles in the writing and editing of the documents, and show a variety of styles of collaborative writing, including writing from scratch, beginning with an outline, pasting in a related example as a template to organize their own writing, and three more. We also found that the document serves as a place where they share a number of things not included in the final document, including links or references to related materials, the assignment requirements from the instructor, and informal discussions to coordinate the collaboration or to structure the document. We computed a number of measures to depict a group's collaboration behavior and asked external graders to score these documents for quality. We found that the documents that included balanced participation and/or exhibited leadership were judged higher in quality, as were those that were longer. We then suggested system design implications and behavioral guidelines to support people writing together better, and concluded the paper with future research directions.",66
"The impact of conflict on co-parenting outcomes of divorce education programs is not widely explored in the literature despite the prevalence of conflict in divorce. This study used outcome data from a sample of participants (N = 272) who took the online Parents Forever (TM) course between 2012 and 2014. Participants were asked questions about positive and negative co-parenting behaviors as well their levels of conflict before and after the divorce or separation. There was on average a slight increase in conflict from post to follow-up (M=-0.397, SD = 1.54). Simple, linear regression analyses indicated that change in conflict explained a significant proportion of the variance in positive co-parenting scores, R-2=0.07, F(1, 270)= 19.98, p < 0.001 and negative co-parenting scores, R-2=0.08, F(1, 270)=23.78, p < 0.001. Results suggest that conflict significantly impacts co-parenting behaviors targeted in the Parents Forever (TM) course. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",18
"Objectives Beyond male/female binaries, gender roles represent masculine and feminine traits that we assimilate and enact throughout life span development. Bem proposed that androgynous individuals adeptly adapt to different contexts by alternating from a strong repertoire of both masculine and feminine gender roles. By contrast, undifferentiated individuals may not adapt as well to social norms because of weak self-endorsed masculinity and femininity. Methods Among 204 adults (mean [standard error] age = 40.4 [0.9] years; 70% women) working in a psychiatric hospital, we hypothesized that androgynous individuals would present better mental health and less physiological dysregulations known as allostatic load (AL) than undifferentiated individuals. AL was indexed using 20 biomarkers using the conventional all-inclusive formulation that ascribes cutoffs without regard for sex or an alternative sex-specific formulation with cutoffs tailored for each sex separately while controlling for sex hormones (testosterone, estradiol, progesterone). Well-validated questionnaires were used. Results Independent of sex, androgynous individuals experienced higher self-esteem and well-being and lower depressive symptoms than did undifferentiated individuals. Men manifested higher AL than did women using the all-inclusive AL index (p = .044, (2)(P) = 0.025). By contrast, the sex-specific AL algorithm unmasked a sex by gender roles interaction for AL (p = .043, (2)(P) = 0.048): with the highest AL levels in undifferentiated men. Analysis using a gender index based on seven gendered constructs revealed that a greater propensity toward feminine characteristics correlated only with elevated sex-specific AL (r = 0.163, p = .025). Conclusions Beyond providing psychobiological evidence for Bem's theory, this study highlights how sex-specific AL formulations detect the effects of sociocultural gender.",77
"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether excessive television viewing throughout childhood and adolescence is associated with increased antisocial behavior in early adulthood. METHODS: We assessed a birth cohort of 1037 individuals born in Dunedin, New Zealand, in 1972-1973, at regular intervals from birth to age 26 years. We used regression analysis to investigate the associations between television viewing hours from ages 5 to 15 years and criminal convictions, violent convictions, diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder, and aggressive personality traits in early adulthood. RESULTS: Young adults who had spent more time watching television during childhood and adolescence were significantly more likely to have a criminal conviction, a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder, and more aggressive personality traits compared with those who viewed less television. The associations were statistically significant after controlling for sex IQ, socioeconomic status, previous antisocial behavior, and parental control. The associations were similar for both sexes, indicating that the relationship between television viewing and antisocial behavior is similar for male and female viewers. CONCLUSIONS: Excessive television viewing in childhood and adolescence is associated with increased antisocial behavior in early adulthood. The findings are consistent with a causal association and support the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation that children should watch no more than 1 to 2 hours of television each day.

"Do social cognition and epistemological understanding promote elementary school children's experimentation skills? To investigate this question, 402 children (ages 8, 9, and 10) in 2nd, 3rd, and 4th grades were assessed for their experimentation skills, social cognition (advanced theory of mind [AToM]), epistemological understanding (understanding the nature of science), and general information- processing skills (inhibition, intelligence, and language abilities) in a whole- class testing procedure. A multiple indicators multiple causes model revealed a significant influence of social cognition (AToM) on epistemological understanding, and a McNemar test suggested that children's development of AToM is an important precursor for the emergence of an advanced, mature epistemological understanding. Children's epistemological understanding, in turn, predicted their experimentation skills. Importantly, this relation was independent of the common influences of general information processing. Significant relations between experimentation skills and inhibition, and between epistemological understanding, intelligence, and language abilities emerged, suggesting that general information processing contributes to the conceptual development that is involved in scientific thinking. The model of scientific thinking that was tested in this study (social cognition and epistemological understanding promote experimentation skills) fitted the data significantly better than 2 alternative models, which assumed nonspecific, equally strong relations between all constructs under investigation. Our results support the conclusion that social cognition plays a foundational role in the emergence of children's epistemological understanding, which in turn is closely related to the development of experimentation skills. Our findings have significant implications for the teaching of scientific thinking in elementary school and they stress the importance of children's epistemological understanding in scientific- thinking processes.",62
"Enzymatic inhibition by product molecules is an important and widespread phenomenon. We describe an approach to study product inhibition at the single-molecule level. Individual HRP molecules are trapped within surface-tethered lipid vesicles, and their reaction with a fluorogenic substrate is probed. While the substrate readily penetrates into the vesicles, the charged product (resorufin) gets trapped and accumulates inside the vesicles. Surprisingly, individual enzyme molecules are found to stall when a few tens of product molecules accumulate. Bulk enzymology experiments verify that the enzyme is noncompetitively inhibited by resorufin. The initial reaction velocity of individual enzyme molecules and the number of product molecules required for their complete inhibition are broadly distributed and dynamically disordered. The two seemingly unrelated parameters, however, are found to be substantially correlated with each other in each enzyme molecule and over long times. These results suggest that, as a way to counter disorder, enzymes have evolved the means to correlate fluctuations at structurally distinct functional sites.",36
"Previous studies have reported that life satisfaction (LS) is positively associated with time perspective (TP) and mindfulness and that mindfulness may provide a holistic TP that integrates and helps to balance different time frames. However, studies performed to date have only been conducted in Eastern and Central Europe. Given the important cultural differences in time management between these regions and Mediterranean countries, the purpose of the present study was to replicate those studies to assess the association between mindfulness, TP, and LS in a sample of young adults living in the province of Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain). A total of 377 undergraduate university students (65.25% women) were recruited and completed the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI), and the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS). Results show significant positive relationships between LS, mindfulness, and past positive, as well as negative associations between LS, past negative, and an unbalanced TP. Mindfulness also correlated inversely with an unbalanced TP. Regression analyses showed that 27% of variance in LS could be explained by the past negative and past positive ZTPI measures together with the MAAS. These results confirm the conclusions of previous studies conducted in culturally different populations and reinforce the hypothesis that mindfulness provides a holistic TP that intrinsically balances TP and increases LS. These findings suggest that a mindful attitude might be a key component of TP regulation that transcends different European cultural backgrounds.",108
"The daily return and the realized volatility are simultaneously modeled in the stochastic volatility model with leverage and long memory. The dependent variable in the stochastic volatility model is the logarithm of the squared return, and its error distribution is approximated by a mixture of normals. In addition, the logarithm of the realized volatility is incorporated into the measurement equation, assuming that the latent log volatility follows an Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (ARFIMA) process to describe its long memory property. The efficient Bayesian estimation method using Markov chain Monte Carlo method (MCMC) was proposed and implemented in the state space representation. Model comparisons are performed based on the marginal likelihood, and the volatility forecasting performances are investigated using S&P500 stock index returns. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

"All currently approved drugs for schizophrenia work mainly by dopaminergic antagonism. While they are efficacious for psychotic symptoms, their efficacy is limited for negative symptoms and cognitive deficits which underlie the substantive disability in this illness. Recent insights into the biological basis of schizophrenia, especially in relation to non-dopaminergic mechanisms, have raised the efforts to find novel and effective drug targets, though with relatively little success thus far. Potential impediments to novel drug discovery include the continued use of symptom based disease definitions which leads to etiological and pathophysiological heterogeneity, lack of valid preclinical models for drug testing, and design limitations in clinical trials. These roadblocks can be addressed by (i) characterizing trans-diagnostic, translational pathophysiological dimensions as potential treatment targets, (ii) efficiency, accountability and, transparency in approaches to the clinical trials process, and (iii) leveraging recent advances in genetics and in vitro phenotypes. Accomplishing these goals is urgent given the significant unmet needs in the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia. As this happens, it is imperative that clinicians employ optimal dosing, measurement-based care, and other best practices in utilizing existing treatments to optimize outcomes for their patients today.

"Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) show significant impairments in social skills and theory of mind (ToM). The aim of this study was to evaluate ToM and social information processing abilities in 52 children with ASD compared to 55 typically developing (TD) children. A mediation analysis evaluated whether social information processing abilities can be mediated by ToM competences. In our results, children with autism showed a deficit in social skills and ToM components. The innovative results of our study applying mediation analysis demonstrate that ToM plays a key role in the development of social abilities, and the lack of ToM competences in children with autism impairs their competent social behavior.",62
"Objectives. To examine the effect of in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment on acoustic properties of women's voice. Study Design. Prospective case series. Methods. Ten women undergoing IVF treatment participated in the study. All participants were recorded repeatedly in three successive sessions, before and during treatment, in addition to collecting hormonal assays, endometrial thickness measurements, and follicular growth data. Recordings were performed while sustaining an isolated vowel repeatedly and during a reading task. Acoustic analyses included a limited set of fundamental frequency (F-0) measures, as well as frequency-and amplitude perturbation measures. Repeated-measure analyses of variance were performed to test for the treatment effect, and the correlations between the acoustic measures and the hormonal as well as endometrial thickness data were examined. Results. A significant reduction in the two F-0 measures and in the amplitude perturbation measure was found throughout the treatment (P < 0.05). Before treatment, a negative correlation was found between F-0 and estrogen levels. After treatment, however, a negative correlation was found between F-0 and endometrial thickness. Conclusion. An association was found between IVF treatment and specific voice properties. In addition, the possibility of a ceiling effect for the influence of estrogens on female vocal folds was introduced.",116
"The rapidly changing demographics of the United States workforce include a large number of women and members of minority groups that are currently underrepresented in science and engineering-related education and careers. Recent research indicates that while singular incidents of sexism do exist, gender bias more often affects women in various subtle ways. The effects of stereotype threat and the lack of appropriatementoring and female role models are samples of the possible factors contributing to performance and longevity for women in math-intensive fields. To address how this issue affects those in radiation protection, the current status of women in the field is reviewed as a progression through the scientific pipeline, from education and employment to positions in scientific bodies and professional recognition, with primary focus on American women and institutions. Racial diversity demographics are reviewedwhere available. Findings indicate women and minority racial groups are underrepresented in multiple aspects of education, research, and leadership. While gender diversity across the field has not yet reached gender parity, trending indicates that the percentage of women earning degrees in radiation protection has consistently increased over the last four decades. Diversity of racial groups, however, has remained fairly consistent and is well below national averages. Diverse perspectives have been documented in collective problem-solving to lead to more innovative solutions.",66

"Purpose The aim of this study was to investigate homophobic attitudes in three European countries: Italy, Albania, and Ukraine. One thousand and forty-eight students were recruited in Italian (n = 766), Albanian (n = 180), and Ukrainian (n = 102) university centers. Methods A socio-demographic questionnaire and Homophobia Scale (HS) were administered by our staff. Results Cross-cultural and significant differences among Italian, Albanian, and Ukrainian students were found on the Homophobia Scale (HS; Italy: mean = 22.26 +/- 16.73; Albania: mean = 38.15 +/- 17.28; Ukraine: mean = 59.18 +/- 16.23). The analysis of sociodemographic characteristics revealed that the male gender emerged as main predictor of homophobic attitude in all the three countries, although also a conservative political orientation and the religious belief predict higher homophobia levels in Italy and Albania, particularly. Conclusions This study revealed that in these European countries assessed, attitudes toward homosexuality are different. Ukrainians display higher levels of homophobia than Albanians and Italians, confirming the central role of cultural differences in homophobic attitudes. Nevertheless, some socio-demographic aspects such as identification as male have a similar influence on homophobic attitudes in all assessed populations.",61
"Among alternative scheduling techniques in construction management are linear and repetitive scheduling and line of balance (LOB). They are uniquely different from the dominant network-based technique because they have been developed for projects with repetitive units of work and crew operations. Notably, they feature quantitative measures of both work and time, which no network-based approach offers. However, a study of their origins - for example, the US Navy - reveals that their original use and capabilities deviate from current application, which is limited at best. Indeed, currently, the name-giving LOB is itself omitted. Therefore, this research has the goal to explore these scheduling techniques in detail. Its objectives are to delineate their modelling elements as described by original sources in a structured manner, to compare them in detail and identify any changes over time and to comment on implications for practical use and extract unsolved research questions. Its methodology follows a comparative research approach. Differences are found in how productivity and cyclic crew deployment are expressed, besides the glaring omission of the LOB itself in the construction use of this method. It is found that, historically, LOB was intended for manufacturing, but when introduced to construction, important characteristics of the production plan and progress chart became forgotten. In parallel, linear scheduling was developed for construction, whose similarities to LOB may have added confusion. Clarifying the complete methods by explicitly outlining their analytical capabilities will improve understanding to allow project managers to benefit from these powerful tools. It also enables future research to model LOB with singularity functions to yield a unified formulation of these alternative scheduling techniques.",102
"Esophagitis dissecans superficialis (EDS) is a rare desquamative disorder of the esophagus. It is characterized by sheets of sloughed squamous tissue with normal underlying mucosa. We present a case of a 68-year-old man with severe anemia and a positive fecal occult blood test who was found to have features suggestive of EDS during endoscopy. However, histological features were suggestive of both EDS and fungal esophagitis. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case in literature which discusses the clinical scenario of fungal infection being a possible etiology rather than a commonly accepted differential diagnosis of EDS. We also review the clinical features, diagnostic criteria and treatment of EDS.",126
"This article reviews some of the recent advances on FTIR spectroscopy in areas related to natural tissues and cell biology. It is an update on our previously published review on the applications of spectroscopic methods employed for the analysis of biological molecules, and summarizes some of the most widely used peak frequencies and their assignments. The aim of this review is to update and consolidate our previously published spectral database, which will help researchers in defining the chemical structure of the biological tissues introducing most of the important peaks present in the natural tissues more precisely and accurately. In spite of applying different methods, there seems to be a considerable similarity in defining the peaks of identical areas of the FTIR spectra. As a result, it is believed that preparing a unique collection of the frequencies encountered in FTIR spectroscopic studies can provide substantial help for future studies. In this article, we have included recent studies that have been reported since previous publication that will be of considerable assistance and added value to those who are focusing their research on defining chemical pathway to the progression of different diseases.",31
"Construction projects usually encompass numerous disciplines, requiring the integration of knowledge from civil, mechanical, electrical and other engineering domains. Some researchers contend that the integration of construction knowledge and experience at the early design phase would improve the overall project performance. Domination of tacit knowledge during design phase of building projects is the major source of knowledge flow problems between involved professionals. Therefore, this study intends to explicate the required mechanical and electrical knowledge which has to be considered during the conceptual design phase of a green building project. To fulfil this goal, a case study has been conducted to specify the entity of the required mechanical and electrical knowledge. The primary method for the data collection here is observation. Furthermore, this study employs the triangulation method in order to validate the collected data. The results contain the required mechanical and electrical knowledge which has to be considered during the conceptual design phase of a green building project.",99
Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy is applied to study the point defects formed upon Zn diffusion in semi-insulating GaAs. The diffusion was performed by annealing the samples at 950 degrees C for different times under different As vapor pressures. Deep and shallow positron traps were observed by lifetime spectroscopy. Zn acceptors are assumed to act as shallow traps. A complex containing the As vacancy and Zn atoms is suggested to be the deep positron traps. The observation of As vacancy complexes is elucidated by studying the influence of As vapor pressure applying the mass action law of thermodynamics of point defects. (C) 2017 Acta Materialia Inc.

"Background: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as key players in a remarkably variety of biological processes and pathologic conditions, including cancer. Next-generation sequencing technologies and bioinformatics procedures predict the existence of tens of thousands of lncRNAs, from which we know the functions of only a handful of them, and very little is known in cancer types such as head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). Results: Here, we use RNAseq expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and various statistic and software tools in order to get insight about the lncRNome in HNSCC. Based on lncRNA expression across 426 samples, we discover five distinct tumor clusters that we compare with reported clusters based on various genomic/genetic features. Results demonstrate significant associations between lncRNA-based clustering and DNA methylation, TP53 mutation, and human papillomavirus infection. Using ""guilt-by-association"" procedures, we infer the possible biological functions of representative lncRNAs of each cluster. Furthermore, we found that lncRNA clustering is correlated with some important clinical and pathologic features, including patient survival after treatment, tumor grade, or sub-anatomical location. Conclusions: We present a landscape of lncRNAs in HNSCC and provide associations with important genotypic and phenotypic features that may help to understand the disease.",42
"Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) represents an individual's perception of physical, mental, and social well-being and is a strong predictor of health status. Few studies have examined associations of sedentary behavior (SB) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) with HRQOL in the general population. This study aimed to determine combined associations of objectively measured SB and MVPA on the risk of poor HRQOL in the general US population, after controlling for potential confounding factors. We analyzed data from 5359 adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2006. HRQOL was measured using a HRQOL-4 consisting of four questions focused on the self-perception of general health, physical health, mental health, and activity limitation. We dichotomized each HRQOL-4 component as good versus poor and defined poor overall HRQOL when participants had any poor HRQOL components. SB and MVPA were measured using an accelerometer. Survey logistic models were examined to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for poor HRQOL by SB and MVPA as tertiles. When examined as a combination of SB and MVPA, a substantial decrease in the risk of poor overall HRQOL was found in individuals with low SB/high MVPA [OR 0.69 (95% CI 0.51-0.94) and moderate SB/high MVPA (OR 0.56 (95% CI 0.40-0.78)], but no significant decrease was found in individuals with high SB/high MVPA (vs. high SB/low MVPA). Our findings suggest that both increasing MVPA and reducing time spent in SB may be useful strategies to improve HRQOL.",125
"Purpose: Recent studies linked adolescents' media use to a variety of physical, psychological and social impairments. However, research neglected that adolescents' media use is complex and includes various combinations of activities such as mobile internet browsing, calling, online gaming or use of social network sites. Methods: The aim of this study is to use latent class analysis in a sample 895 Swiss adolescents to classify different media usage types based on eleven media use variables. Subsequently, associations of these classes with health related quality of life (HRQoL) as measured by the KIDSCREEN-52 questionnaire were assessed using multivariable regression models adjusted for relevant confounding factors. Results: Five distinct media use classes could be identified: Low Use, Medium Use, Gaming, Call Preference and High Social Use. The Low Use class reported highest and the High Social Use class lowest HRQoL on the KIDSCREEN scales Moods and Emotions (mean adjusted scores: 55.1 (95%Cl: 53.8; 57.0) vs. 49.1 (47.5; 50.7)), Self-Perception (51.8 (50.3; 53.3) vs. 48.0 (46.7; 49.28), Parents and Home Life (53.3 (51.7; 54.9) vs. 48.6 (47.2; 50.0)) and School Environment (52.7 (51.3; 54.0) vs. 49.3 (48.2; 50.7)). On the subscale Social Support and Peers the pattern was reversed. The Low Use class indicated least and the High Social Use class most well-being (48.5 (47.0; 50.0) vs. 53.8 (52.4; 55.3)). Conclusions: Latent class analyses is a fruitful approach to differentiate between various media usage types and is expected to better characterize and evaluate potential causal associations between media use and HRQoL. 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"Background. Cognitive deficits are predictors of functional outcome in patients with psychosis. While conventional anti-psychotics are relatively effective on positive symptoms, their impact on negative and cognitive symptoms is limited. Recent studies have established a link between oxidative stress and neurocognitive deficits in psychosis. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a glutathione precursor with glutamatergic properties, has shown efficacy on negative symptoms and functioning in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, respectively. However, there are few evidence-based approaches for managing cognitive impairment in psychosis. The present study aims to examine the cognitive effects of adjunctive NAC treatment in a pooled subgroup of participants with psychosis who completed neuropsychological assessment in two trials of both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Method. A sample of 58 participants were randomized in a double fashion to receive 2 g/day of NAC (n = 27) or placebo (n = 31) for 24 weeks. Attention, working memory and executive function domains were assessed. Differences between cognitive performance at baseline and end point were examined using Wilcoxon's test. The Mann-Whitney test was used to examine the differences between the NAC and placebo groups at the end point. Results. Participants treated with NAC had significantly higher working memory performance at week 24 compared with placebo (u = 98.5, p = 0.027). Conclusions. NAC may have an impact on cognitive performance in psychosis, as a significant improvement in working memory was observed in the NAC-treated group compared with placebo; however, these preliminary data require replication. Glutamatergic compounds such as NAC may constitute a step towards the development of useful therapies for cognitive impairment in psychosis.",115
"Soymeal, which contains natural plasticizer and tackifier, has been used to fabricate biodegradable and low-cost warp sizes, with potential for replacing non-biodegradable polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) sizes for large-quantity industrial applications. Warp sizes from soyprotein isolates (SPI) have been reported as a potential substitute for PVA sizes, which contribute to high chemical oxygen demand in textile effluents and cause serious water pollution. However, sizes from SPI are high in cost and need additional plasticizers to overcome brittleness of films. In this research, the developed low-cost soymeal sizes contain soyprotein as majority and saccharides/saponified-oil from soymeal as minorities. Comparing to films from triethanolamine-plasticized SPI sizes, the soymeal size had about 30.1, 25.2 and 8.3% higher film flexibility, adhesion to yarns and abrasion resistance, respectively. Saccharides in soymeal and saponified oil formed during size extraction functioned as plant-based additives with capability of improving adhesion of protein sizing pastes to cotton and/or polyester yarns and increasing elongation of protein-based size films. Successful utilization of soymeal in textile sizing will lead to its large-quantity application, resulting in high value addition to agricultural byproducts and profound impact on soybean industry and textile industry.

"Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between asthma diagnosis and obesity among adolescents exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). Methods: The sample included 28 807 adolescents (13-17 years old) from the National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) (2011-2012). Study design: The NSCH is a US cross-sectional telephone survey that included at least one child between the ages of 0 and 17 years residing at a household during the time of the interview. Descriptive statistics were used to describe sample characteristics and assess the prevalence of asthma among adolescents with obesity exposed to ETS. Logistic regression models were built to assess the effect of obesity on asthma diagnosis within the context of ETS exposure. Results: The prevalence of asthma among adolescents was 10.4% and the obesity was 13.2%. Adolescents with obesity exposed to ETS within the home were significantly (p < 0.05) more likely to have an asthma diagnosis (23%) compared with non-obese (10.9%) residing in similar households. Adjusted odds ratios showed that adolescents with obesity were 2.07 (95% CI, 1.15, 3.70) times more likely to have asthma if they were exposed to ETS inside their homes. Conclusion: The findings indicate that adolescents with obesity are more likely to be diagnosed with asthma if they are exposed to ETS in the household. It is important that the association between obesity and asthma is examined within the context of environmental risk factors in future studies, as this may shed some light to underlying mechanisms between these two serious public health issues.",117
"Individual differences in early attention are associated with later social, cognitive, and emotional development, and attentional deficits in the first year are associated with risk for developmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The First Year Inventory (FYI; Baranek, Watson, Crais, & Reznick, 2003) was developed to identify 12-month-olds at risk for an ASD diagnosis. The current study identifies FYI items that reflect aspects of early attention that might predict future typical and atypical social, cognitive, and emotional development. Using a series of theoretical and statistical methods, we developed 3 attention-based constructs from the FYI: Responding to Social Attention (RSA), Initiating Social Attention (ISA), and Nonsocial Sensory Attention (NSA). A database with completed FYIs was analyzed using these constructs to determine the strength of relations among items. Cronbach's alpha analyses indicated good internal consistency, and item distribution was further supported using a confirmatory factor analysis. Data analyses showed statistically significant relations between the scores on these domains at 12 months and subsequent social responsiveness scores at 3 years. Analyses demonstrating the statistical and predictive validity of these 3 FYI attention constructs support their use for innovative explorations of infant behavioral patterns that can be used to predict typical and atypical individual trajectories in the development of later social, cognitive, and emotional skills.",62
"Computational fluid dynamic models based on the LIMPET OWC turbo generation section were created to investigate how airflow impingement created by a rotating turbine directly upstream increased the heat transfer away from an electrical generator, and how this could be increased by adjusting the clearance between the turbine tips and shroud. It was found that reducing the clearance had consistent beneficial effects on both the turbine performance and generator cooling due to a greater utilisation of airflow after the tip gap.",52
"Objective: To provide evidence- or consensus-based recommendations concerning the assessment and management of sleep problems in youths with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Method: PubMed, Ovid, EMBASE, and Web of Knowledge were searched through October 31, 2012. When no evidence was available, consensus of the authors was achieved. The evidence-level of the recommendations on the management of sleep disturbances was based on the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) system. Results: A total of 139 original articles on sleep and childhood ADHD were retrieved, including 22 on treatment of sleep disturbances. This review focuses on behaviorally based insomnia, circadian rhythm disorder, sleep-disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome/periodic limb movement disorder, and sleep disturbances due to comorbid psychiatric disorders or ADHD medications. Healthy sleep practices are recommended as the foundation of management strategies. Behavioral interventions should be considered as first-line treatment of insomnia, although further evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is needed to prove their efficacy in ADHD. Among pharmacological treatments, RCTs support the use of melatonin to reduce sleep-onset delay, whereas there is more limited evidence for other medications. Conclusion: Growing empirical evidence is informing assessment/management strategies of sleep problems in youths with ADHD. However, further RCTs are warranted to support current recommendations.",128
"Osteoporotic fractures are a major concern for the health care of elderly and female populations. Early diagnosis of patients with a high risk of osteoporotic fractures can be enhanced by introducing second-order statistical analysis of bone image data using techniques such as variogram analysis. Such analysis is computationally intensive thereby creating an impediment for introduction into imaging machines found in common clinical settings. This paper investigates the fast implementation of the semivariogram algorithm, which has been proven to be effective in modeling bone strength, and should be of interest to readers in the areas of computer-aided diagnosis and quantitative image analysis. The semivariogram is a statistical measure of the spatial distribution of data, and is based on Markov random fields. Semivariogram analysis is a computationally intensive algorithm that has typically seen applications in the geosciences and remote sensing areas. Recently, applications in the area of medical imaging have been investigated, resulting in the need for efficient real-time implementation of the algorithm. A semivariance, gamma(h), is defined as the half of the expected squared differences of pixel values between any two data locations with a lag distance of h. Due to the need to examine each pair of pixels in the image or sub-image being processed, the base algorithm complexity for an image window with n pixels is O(n(2)). Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are an attractive solution for such demanding applications due to their parallel processing capability. FPGAs also tend to operate at relatively modest clock rates measured in a few hundreds of megahertz. This paper presents a technique for the fast computation of the semivariogram using two custom FPGA architectures. A modular architecture approach is chosen to allow for replication of processing units. This allows for high throughput due to concurrent processing of pixel pairs. The current implementation is focused on isotropic semivariogram computations only. The algorithm is benchmarked using VHDL on a Xilinx XUPV5-LX110T development Kit, which utilizes the Virtex5 FPGA. Medical image data from DXA scans are utilized for the experiments. Implementation results show that a significant advantage in computational speed is attained by the architectures with respect to implementation on a personal computer with an Intel i7 multi-core processor.",94
"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are an integral part of peripheral tolerance, suppressing immune reactions against self-structures and thus preventing autoimmune diseases. Clinical approaches to adoptively transfer Tregs, or to deplete Tregs in cancer, are underway with promising first outcomes. Because the number of naturally occurring Tregs (nTregs) is very limited, studying certain Treg features using in vitro induced Tregs (iTregs) can be advantageous. To date, the best although not absolutely specific protein marker to delineate Tregs is the transcription factor FOXP3. Despite the importance of Tregs including non-redundant roles of peripherally induced Tregs, the protocols to generate iTregs are currently controversial, particularly for human cells. This protocol therefore describes the in vitro differentiation of human CD4+FOXP3+ iTregs from human naive T cells using a range of Treg-inducing factors (TGF-beta plus IL-2 only, or their combination with retinoic acid, rapamycin or butyrate) in parallel. It also describes the phenotyping of these cells by flow cytometry and qRT-PCR. These protocols result in reproducible expression of FOXP3 and other Treg signature genes and enable the study of general FOXP3-regulatory mechanisms as well as protocol-specific effects to delineate the impact of certain factors. iTregs can be utilized to study various phenotypic aspects as well as molecular mechanisms of Treg induction. Detailed molecular studies are facilitated by relatively large cell numbers that can be obtained. A limitation for the application of iTregs is the relative instability of FOXP3 expression in these cells compared to nTregs. iTregs generated by these protocols can also be used for functional assays such as studying their suppressive function, in which iTregs induced by TGF-beta plus retinoic acid and rapamycin display superior suppressive activity. However, the suppressive capacity of iTregs can differ from nTregs and the use of appropriate controls is crucial.",33
"This study examined the usefulness of statistical parametric mapping (SPM) for investigating postmortem changes on brain computed tomography (CT). This retrospective study included 128 patients (23 - 100 years old) without cerebral abnormalities who underwent unenhanced brain CT before and after death. The antemortem CT (AMCT) scans and postmortem CT (PMCT) scans were spatially normalized using our original brain CT template, and postmortem changes of CT values (in Hounsfield units; HU) were analysed by the SPM technique. Compared with AMCT scans, 58.6 % and 98.4 % of PMCT scans showed loss of the cerebral sulci and an unclear grey matter (GM)-white matter (WM) interface, respectively. SPM analysis revealed a significant decrease in cortical GM density within 70 min after death on PMCT scans, suggesting cytotoxic brain oedema. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in the density of the WM, lenticular nucleus and thalamus more than 120 min after death. The SPM technique demonstrated typical postmortem changes on brain CT scans, and revealed that the unclear GM-WM interface on early PMCT scans is caused by a rapid decrease in cortical GM density combined with a delayed increase in WM density. SPM may be useful for assessment of whole brain postmortem changes. aEuro cent The original brain CT template achieved successful normalization of brain morphology. aEuro cent Postmortem changes in the brain were independent of sex. aEuro cent Cortical GM density decreased rapidly after death. aEuro cent WM and deep GM densities increased following cortical GM density change. aEuro cent SPM could be useful for assessment of whole brain postmortem changes.",119
"In this paper, the development of a novel controller for a bidirectional buck and boost converter is studied to implement an active capacitance. To this end, an averaging method is used to obtain a nonlinear state-space model of the converter in the Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) for buck and boost configurations, separately. These models are then combined into a state-space representation for the whole range of operation. Using the obtained model, a controller is designed to track a desired input current based on the applied input voltage such that the circuit exhibits a capacitive effect between the input terminals. The converter along with its proposed control method is a suitable replacement for the commonly used electrolytic capacitors in different applications. Simulation results are presented that demonstrate performance of the proposed current control method. Experimental verification is currently under investigation.",58
"A smart camera is a vision system capable of extracting application-specific information from the captured images. The paper proposes a decentralized and efficient solution for visual parking lot occupancy detection based on a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) specifically designed for smart cameras. This solution is compared with state-of-the-art approaches using two visual datasets: PKLot, already existing in literature, and CNRParlc-EXT. The former is an existing dataset, that allowed us to exhaustively compare with previous works. The latter dataset has been created in the context of this research, accumulating data across various seasons of the year, to test our approach in particularly challenging situations, exhibiting occlusions, and diverse and difficult viewpoints. This dataset is public available to the scientific community and is another contribution of our research. Our experiments show that our solution outperforms and generalizes the best performing approaches on both datasets. The performance of our proposed CNN architecture on the parking lot occupancy detection task, is comparable to the well-known AlexNet, which is three orders of magnitude larger.

"Background: It is assumed that beside alterations in the filaggrin gene (FLG), disturbances within genes encoding other cornified envelope proteins are also involved in atopic dermatitis (AD). To identify new potential markers of AD, we studied the polymorphisms of genes encoding repetin (RPTN), cornulin (CRNN), and their expression in the skin of AD patients. Methods: Polymorphisms in CRNN (rs941934), RPTN (rs284544, rs28441202, rs3001978, and rs12117644), and FLG mutations (R2447X, S3247X) were analyzed by TaqMan genotyping assay and by PCR-RFLP in the blood samples of 159 AD patients and 108 healthy subjects.The expression levels of CRNN and RPTN were determined by qRT-PCR in 34 AD skin samples (17 lesional and 17 nonlesional) and in 27 skin biopsies from healthy volunteers. The AD patients were recruited from the clinic of the university hospital between 2012 and 2014. Results: CRNN rs941934 (A allele) was associated with AD (OR 2.095, p = 0.008), a severe course of disease (p = 0.041), elevated IgE levels (p = 0.047), eosinophilia (p = 0.018), and concomitant asthma (p = 0.004). The mRNA level of CRNN was decreased in the AD skin (p = 0.041). In the AD patients without FLG mutations, the CC genotype of RPTN rs3001978 was associated with AD (OR 0.39, p = 0.037), early age at onset (p = 0.033), pruritus (p = 0.021), severity of AD (p = 0.045), and concomitant asthma (p = 0.041). The elevated mRNA levels of RPTN in lesional (p < 0.001) and nonlesional (p = 0.017) AD skin were observed. Conclusions: The single-nucleotide polymorphisms of CRNN (rs941934) and RPTN (rs3001978, rs28441202) may contribute to AD development, but further studies on a larger group of AD patients are needed to verify this assumption.

"Cancer immune checkpoint therapy has achieved remarkable clinical successes in various cancers. However, current immune checkpoint inhibitors block the checkpoint of not only the immune cells that are important to canter therapy but also the immune cells that are irrelevant to the therapy. Such an indiscriminate blockade limits the efficacy and causes the autoimmune toxicity of the therapy. It might be beneficial to use a carrier to target immune checkpoint inhibitors to cancer reactive immune cells. Here, we explore a method to load the inhibitors into carriers. We used the anti-programmed death-1 antibody (alpha PD-1) as a model immune checkpoint inhibitor. First, we generated a recombinant single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of aPD-1. Then, we designed and generated a fusion protein consisting of the scFv and an amphiphilic immune-tolerant elastin-like polypeptide (iTEP). Because of the amphiphilic iTEP, the fusion was able to self-assemble into a nanoparticle (NP). The NP was proved to block the PD-1 immune checkpoint in vitro and in vivo. Particularly, the NP exacerbated diabetes development in nonobese diabetic mice as effectively as natural, intact aPD-1. In summary, we successfully expressed aPD-1 as a recombinant protein and linked aPD-1 to a NP, which lays a foundation to develop a delivery system to target aPD-1 to a subpopulation of immune cells.",120
"This paper proposes a novel method of semi-regular remeshing for triangulated surfaces to achieve superior triangles lead to advanced visualization of 3D model. It is based on mesh segmentation and subdivision surface fitting which uses curvature-adapted polygon patches. Our contribution lies in building a sophisticated system with three stages, i.e., curvature-aware mesh segmentation, submesh surface fitting to generate a high-quality semi-regular mesh and finally, stitching the segments using an efficient algorithm. Our method uses centroidal Voronoi tessellation and Lloyd's relaxation to generate curvature-adapted site centers. Geodesic distances from site centers are used for labeling segments and indexing corner vertices for each segment boundary. Using information of site centers and corner vertices, feature-adapted polygonal patches are generated for each segment. These patches are then subdivided and optimized using squared distance metric to adjust position of the subdivision sampling with segment details and prevent oversampling. At last, an efficient stitching algorithm is introduced to connect regular submeshes together and build the final semi-regular mesh. We have demonstrated the results of our semi-regular remeshing algorithm on meshes with different topology and complexity and compared them with known methods. Superior triangle quality with higher aspect ratio together with acceptable distortion error is achieved according to the experimental results.",79
"Co-speech gestures in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are poorly understood. Historically, all gestures were thought to be reduced in this social-communicative disorder; however, reduced gestures have not been consistently demonstrated in the empirical literature. Just as protodeclarative pointing is reduced in young children with ASD, while protoimperative pointing is not, the varied functions of co-speech gesture may explain these mixed findings. Verbally fluent adolescents with ASD (n = 18) and controls (n = 18) completed a narrative task and a standardized executive function task. Gestures on the narrative task, which serve a wide range of social and cognitive functions, were reduced in ASD. Gestures on the executive function task, which serve primarily cognitive functions, were increased in ASD. Gesture function may be the best predictor of the presence or absence of gesture in ASD. Despite reduced social-communicative gestures, individuals with ASD may benefit from gesture's internal, cognitive functions.",64
"Selective breeding is an effective tool to improve livestock. Several selection experiments have been conducted to study direct selection responses as well as correlated responses in traits of skeletal muscle growth and function. Moreover, comparisons of domestic with wild-type species and of extreme breeds provide information on the genetic background of the skeletal muscle phenotype. Structural muscular components that differed with increasing distance in lean growth or meat quality in mammals were found to be myofibre number, myofibre size, proportions of fibre types as well as the numbers and proportions of secondary and primary fibres. Furthermore, markers of satellite cell proliferation, metabolic enzyme activities, glycogen and fat contents, the expression of myosin heavy chain isoforms, of activated AMPK alpha and other proteins in skeletal muscle tissue and circulating IGF1 and IGF-binding proteins have been identified to be involved in selection responses observed in pigs, cattle and/or chicken. The use of molecular methods for selective breeding of fish has only recently been adopted in aquaculture and studies of the genetic basis of growth and flesh quality traits are scarce. Some of the molecular markers of muscle structure/metabolism in livestock have also been identified in fish, but so far no studies have linked them with selection response. Genome scans have been applied to identify genomic regions exhibiting quantitative trait loci that control traits of interest, for example, muscle structure and meat quality in pigs and growth rate in chicken. As another approach, polymorphisms in candidate genes reveal the relationship between genetic variation and target traits. Thus, in large-scale studies with pigs' associations of polymorphisms in the HMGA2, CA3, EPOR, NME1 and TTN genes with traits of carcass and meat quality were detected. Other studies revealed the significance of mutations in the IGF2 and RYR1 genes for carcass lean and muscle fibre traits in pigs. Mutations in the myostatin (MSTN) gene in fish were also examined. Advances in research of the genetic and environmental control of traits related to meat quality and growth have been made by the application of holistic 'omics' techniques that studied the whole muscle-specific genome, transcriptome and proteome in relation to muscle and meat traits, the development of new methods for muscle fibre typing and the adaptation of biophysical measures to develop parameters of muscle fibre traits as well as the application of in vitro studies. Finally, future research priorities in the field are defined.",75
"An exact closed-form synthesis method is proposed for the design of narrowband reflection-type (mono-port) phasers with arbitrary prescribed group-delay responses. The proposed synthesis technique consists in three steps. First, it transforms the phase problem from the bandpass domain to the low-pass domain using a one-port ladder network, where a mathematical synthesis is performed via a Hurwitz polynomial. Second, it transforms the synthesized low-pass network back to the bandpass domain for implementation in a specific technology. Third, it uses an iterative post-distortion correction technique to compensate for distributed effects over the broader bandwidth required. The proposed synthesis method is verified by both full-wave analysis and experiment where the synthesized bandpass network is realized in an iris-coupled waveguide configuration.",52
"Objective: The diagnostic workup of uveitis is a challenge due to the wide range of diagnoses and the lack of a well-codified diagnostic procedure. We aimed to evaluate the relevance of diagnostic investigations for the etiological diagnosis of uveitis. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of patients referred for etiological diagnosis of uveitis. Uveitis related to ophthalmological diseases or occurring during the course of previously diagnosed diseases were not included. Results: Three hundred patients were included. Chest CT-scan was suggestive of sarcoidosis in 83 (29%). Features associated with abnormal CT-scan were: snowballs and/or peripheral multifocal choroiditis (PMC) upon ocular examination (P = 0.004), blood lymphopenia (P1.5 ULN (P=0.0003). Bronchoscopy showed granuloma in 18 (11%) while alveolar lymphocytosis suggestive of sarcoidosis was reported in 45 (27%). Presence of granulomaon bronchial biopsies was always associated with chest CT-scan abnormalities, whereas 31% of patients with alveolar lymphocytosis had normal CT-scans. Features associated with contributive bronchoscopy were: snowballs and/or PMC (P = 0.003), ACE N 1.5 ULN (P = 0.007), abnormal chest-CT scan (P = 0.0001). Salivary gland biopsy revealed granuloma in 12 patients (5%). Cerebral MRI was abnormal in 15 patients (9%) who mostly presented with snowballs and/or retinal vasculitis. Finally, the main causes of uveitis were latent tuberculosis (25%) and sarcoidosis (22%), but 34% remained of undetermined origin. Uveitis relapses were observed in 31% and did not differ between patients with an identified diagnosis and those with idiopathic uveitis. Conclusion: Identification of factors associated with abnormal investigations might improve the optimal diagnostic workup adapted to each patient. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.",11
"In a context where the mass, the cost and the mechanical strength of materials must be jointly optimized, it is necessary to have experimental data quickly available and sufficiently robust to make efficient conception choices. For thermomechanical fatigue, standard tests usually allow comparing material for the same temperature and strain ranges although differences in thermal properties such as conductivity or thermal expansion could make significant deviations when the same thermal flux is applied particularly for structure with forced heat flux operating regimes. A new protocol is then proposed in order to compare the specific resistances of metallic materials against thermomechanical fatigue. It can easily rank materials according to their lifetime under thermomechanical loadings where strain range and temperature amplitude are determined by the heat flux applied on an industrial part. The method is based on a complete numerical analysis to determine experimental loading conditions as a temporal evolution of temperature and mechanical strain representative of thermomechanical loading observed in TMF critical areas for the part. TMF tests on hollow specimens are carried out to rank the materials: temperature and strain amplitude are different for each alloys whereas heat flux is identical. A materials ranking list based on TMF resistance is then determined according to their lifetimes under ""heat-flux-controlled"" tests. The method is tested for exhaust parts and demonstrates the superiority of some cast irons over others, whereas the intrinsic isotherm mechanical properties suggested an alternative classification. The obtained ranking is confirmed by experimental tests on industrial structures. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",91
"Maxima is a free and open-source computer algebra system that can perform symbolic computations such as solving equations, determining derivatives of functions, obtaining Taylor series, and manipulating algebraic expressions. In this article, I present the Maxima Bridge System, which is a collection of software programs that allows Stata to interface with Maxima so that Maxima can be used for symbolic computation to transfer data from Stata to Maxima and to retrieve results from Maxima. The cooperation between Stata and Maxima provides an environment for statistical analysis in which symbolic computation can be easily used together with all the facilities supplied by Stata. In this environment, symbolic computation algorithms can be used to manage the complexity of algebra and calculus, whereas numerical computation can be used when speed matters. I also discuss the software architecture of the Maxima Bridge System, and I present several examples to illustrate how to develop new Stata commands that exploit the capabilities of Maxima.",24
"A series of 13 novel pyrimidine-based sulfonamides 6a-m were synthesized in short periods of time under microwave conditions in good to excellent yield (54-86%). The chemical structures of these heterocycles consist of a central pyrimidine ring having a phenyl group and pyrimidine groups with sulfonamide motifs. The enzyme inhibitory potential of these compounds was investigated against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) because these enzymes play a crucial role in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. As compared to the reference compound eserine (IC50=0.04 +/- 0.0001 mu M for AChE and IC50=0.85 +/- 0.0001 mu M for BChE), the IC50 values of the synthesized compounds ranged from 3.73 +/- 0.61 mu M to 57.36 +/- 0.22 mu M for AChE and 4.81 +/- 0.16 mu M to 111.61 +/- 0.53 mu M for BChE. Among these tested compounds, 6j having a -CH3 group was found to be the most potent one against both enzymes (AChE, IC50=3.73 +/- 0.61 mu M; BChE, IC50=4.81 +/- 0.16 mu M). Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) and molecular docking studies of the synthesized compounds were also performed.",106
"Recent demographic changes in the forest-owner structure are suspected to have led to the increasing number of owners with no specific objectives for their forests. In addition, the continuous fragmentation of the forest holdings has increased the threat of the passiveness related to forest management. To decrease the tendency towards passiveness, new policy tools and initiatives have been suggested. In the Finnish context, the idea of an investor-based jointly owned forest has been introduced as facilitating the effective utilization of the forest resource. However, collective ownership has faced prejudice and scepticism among private forest owners. In order to expand, the forest owners need to see the idea of jointly owned forests as a socially legitimate. Thus, by adopting Van Leeuwen's framework for analyzing the legitimation of new social practices, we examine how Finnish forest owners legitimate their participation in jointly owned forests. The qualitative data of the study consist of 20 in-depth interviews with private forest owners who have joined a jointly owned forest. Our study contributes to the recent discussion on jointly owned forests. We show how a change in the type of ownership results in moral, authoritative and rational justifications over the decision while simultaneously renewing the identity of the forest owner. Accordingly, we suggest that forest ownership is not only driven by rational prospects, but the moral and emotional nature of ownership should be better taken into account at the policy level and in structural designs when discussing the promotion of new types of forest ownership.",61
"Proteins harbor domains or short linear motifs, which facilitate their functions and interactions. Finding functional motifs in protein sequences could predict the putative cellular roles or characteristics of hypothetical proteins. In this study, we present Shetti-Motif, which is an interactive tool to (i) map UniProt and PROSITE flat files, (ii) search for multiple pre-defined consensus patterns or experimentally validated functional motifs in large datasets protein sequences (proteome-wide), (iii) search for motifs containing repeated residues (low-complexity regions, e.g., Leu-, SR-, PEST-rich motifs, etc.). As proof of principle, using this comparative proteomics pipeline, eleven proteomes encoded by member of Poxviridae family were searched against about 100 experimentally validated functional motifs. The closely related viruses and viruses infect the same host cells (e.g. vaccinia and variola viruses) show similar motif-containing proteins profile. The motifs encoded by these viruses are correlated, which explains why poxviruses are able to interact with wide range of host cells. In conclusion, this in silico analysis is useful to establish a dataset(s) or potential proteins for further investigation or compare between species.",42
"Software project scheduling in dynamic and uncertain environments is of significant importance to real-world software development. Yet most studies schedule software projects by considering static and deterministic scenarios only, which may cause performance deterioration or even infeasibility when facing disruptions. In order to capture more dynamic features of software project scheduling than the previous work, this paper formulates the project scheduling problem by considering uncertainties and dynamic events that often occur during software project development, and constructs a mathematical model for the resulting multi-objective dynamic project scheduling problem (MODPSP), where the four objectives of project cost, duration, robustness and stability are considered simultaneously under a variety of practical constraints. In order to solve MODPSP appropriately, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based proactive-rescheduling method is proposed, which generates a robust schedule predictively and adapts the previous schedule in response to critical dynamic events during the project execution. Extensive experimental results on 21 problem instances, including three instances derived from real-world software projects, show that our novel method is very effective. By introducing the robustness and stability objectives, and incorporating the dynamic optimization strategies specifically designed for MODPSP, our proactive-rescheduling method achieves a very good overall performance in a dynamic environment.",123
"The fate of pharmaceuticals in our environment is a very important issue for environmental and health research. Although these substances have been detected in environmental compartments in low concentration until now, they will pose considerable environmental risk to ecosystems, animals and human due to their biological activity. Alternative plant based removal technologies that make use of some potential wetland species like Phragmites or Typha within traditional wastewater treatment plants have to be established to cope with this ""new generation"" of pollutants. We investigated uptake and translocation of diclofenac (1 mg l(-1)) in the macrophyte Typha latifolia L. during one week exposure in greenhouse experiments. Detoxification products and involved key enzymatic processes were identified. We also examined the oxidative stress induced by the treatment and the defense capacity of the plants. Rapid uptake and effective metabolism were observed, where glycoside and glutathione conjugates represent dominant metabolites. Up to seven-fold induction of glycosyltransferase activity was observed in roots, but not in shoots. Glutathione S-transferase activity was also induced, but to a lower extent. The activity changes of defense enzymes points to oxidative stress in the plants. Our results show that human pharmaceuticals can be metabolized by plants similar to xenobiotics, but that similarities to human metabolism are limited. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

"Phospholipid flippases are key regulators of transbilayer lipid asymmetry in eukaryotic cell membranes, critical to many trafficking and signaling pathways. P4-ATPases, in particular, are responsible for the uphill transport of phospholipids from the exoplasmic to the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane, as well as membranes of the late secretory/endocytic pathways, thereby establishing transbilayer asymmetry. Recent studies combining cell biology and biochemical approaches have improved our understanding of the path taken by lipids through P4-ATPases. Additionally, identification of several protein families catalyzing phospholipid 'scrambling', i.e. disruption of phospholipid asymmetry through energy-independent bi-directional phospholipid transport, as well as the recent report of the structure of such a scramblase, opens the way to a deeper characterization of their mechanism of action. Here, we discuss the molecular nature of the mechanism by which lipids may 'flip' across membranes, with an emphasis on active lipid transport catalyzed by P4-ATPases.

"Recent innovations in molecular biology and colorectal cancer (CRC) genetics have facilitated the understanding of the pathogenesis of sporadic and hereditary CRC syndromes. The development of technology has enabled data collection for a number of genetic factors, which lead to understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying CRC. The incidence and the nature of CRC is a mixture of genetic and environmental factors. The current field of interest is to understand how molecular basis could shape predisposition for developing CRC, disease progression and response to chemotherapy. In this article, we summarize new and developing genetic markers, and assess their clinical value for inherited and sporadic CRC.",30
"Older adults have a 50% or greater prevalence of urinary incontinence and other lower urinary tract symptoms such as urinary urgency and nocturia, or waking from sleep to urinate. These bladder control problems place older adults at increased risk of falling, and are associated with a wide range of negative health and rehabilitation outcomes. Rehabilitation clinicians can identify and assess bladder control problems in their patients and provide basic interventions, which may improve quality of life and health and rehabilitation outcomes of the aging adult. This clinical commentary aims to systematically explain assessment and treatment options for bladder control problems in elders that can be used by all rehabilitation clinicians.",17
"Background: Atrial arrhythmias (AAs) are frequent after lung transplantation (LT) and late postoperatively. Several predictive factors of early postoperative AAs after LT have been identified but those of late AAs remain unknown. Whether AA after LT affects mortality is still being debated. This study assessed in a large cohort of LT patients the incidence of AAs early and late after surgery, their predictive factors and their effect on mortality. Methods and Results: We studied 271 consecutive LT patients over 9 years. Mean follow-up was 2.9 2.4 years. 33% patients developed postoperative AAs. Age (odds ratio (OR) 2.35; confidence interval (CI) [1.31-4.24]; P=0.004) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 2.13; Cl [1.12-4.03]; P=0.02) were independent predictive factors of early AAs. Late AAs occurred 2.2 2.7 years after transplant in 8.8% of the patients. Pretransplant systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (PTsPAP) was the only independent predictive factor of late AA (OR 1.028; CI [1.001-1.056]; P=0.04). Double LT was associated with long-term freedom from atrial fibrillation (AF) but not from atrial flutter (AFL). Early and late Ms after surgery had no effect on mortality. Double LT was associated with better survival. Conclusions: Early AA following LT is common in contrast with the low occurrence of late, often organized, AA. Early and late AAs do not affect mortality. PTsPAP is an independent predictor of late AA. Double LT protects against late AF but not AFL.",111
"Given the facts that a vast area of the earth is covered by water and the average depth of the oceans is more than 3,000 m, the issue of the unknowns beneath the water surface is a challenging and questionable one. It has been a few decades since remotely operated vehicles as well as untethered underwater robots have appeared and elevated the level of complex engineering. In this category, underwater robots that mimic fish and aquatic creatures open new horizons. In this article, imitating the body shape, kinematics, and swimming mechanism of a batoid fish (Dasyatidae), a vessel is designed that can swim at an acceptable speed with a limited amount of power. The hull shape is based on a cardioid curve, and drag force is calculated using fundamentals of fluid mechanics. Propulsion of the robot-fish is two wings at starboard and port that are undulating backward; thrust is approximated versus shaft speed. Finally, the power for swimming at the design speed is evaluated and compared with the available data of similar orders of magnitude.",86
"A preamplifier based on the source-follower direct injection (SFDI) topology for use in read-out integrated circuits (ROIC) of quantum-well infrared photodetectors focal plane arrays (QWIP-FPA) is demonstrated. The fabricated circuit shows high linearity, high integration time (from hundreds of mu s to few ms) and low current detection capabilities for a wide range of input current (order of few pA). This performance was achieved through the use of a Poly1-Poly2 capacitor that, although presenting some penalties in area consumption, provides a higher linearity, lower leakage current and higher temperature stability than all others capacitors found in literature. Secondary effects such as charge injection and clock feed-through are observed in the experimental results and classical techniques, like the use of DUMMY transistor, are shown to be effective in minimizing these effects and maximizing the linearity of the response. The overall results indicate that this circuit architecture has a great potential to be practically integrated in larger QWIP-FPA ROICs, showing an improved performance relating to previous works in literature.",52
"Glucocorticoids (GCs) control essential metabolic processes in virtually every cell in the body and play a vital role in the development of fetal tissues and organ systems. The biological actions of GCs are mediated via glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), the cytoplasmic transcription factors that regulate the transcription of genes involved in placental and fetal growth and development. Several experimental studies have demonstrated that fetal exposure to high maternal GC levels early in gestation is associated with adverse fetal outcomes, including low birthweight, intrauterine growth restriction and anatomical and structural abnormalities that may increase the risk of cardiovascular, metabolic and neuroendocrine disorders in adulthood. The response of the fetus to GCs is dependent on gender, with female fetuses becoming hypersensitive to changes in GC levels whereas male fetuses develop GC resistance in the environment of high maternal GCs. In this paper we review GR function and the physiological and pathological effects of GCs on fetal development. We propose that GC-induced changes in the placental structure and function, including alterations in the expression of GR mRNA and protein levels, may play role in inhibiting in utero fetal growth.",109
"Appreciative joy (or sympathetic joy) refers to feeling happiness for others and is one of the four prosocial attitudes (""four immeasurables"") cultivated by loving-kindness meditation in Buddhism. The current study included 1622 participants and developed a scale to measure appreciative joy for friends in daily life. Both an exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis resulted in an appreciative joy scale consisting of three components: sense of joy, positive interpersonal bias, and self-transcendence (study 1). The appreciative joy scale exhibited high correlations with measurements for interpersonal relationships and four immeasurables. The scale also shows incremental contributions to positive emotions, satisfaction with life, trait happiness, and peace of mind after controlling for interpersonal relationships or the four immeasurables (studies 2 and 3). The scale exhibited higher scores among Buddhists than among individuals with no religious belief, and its structure was maintained across English and Chinese samples (study 4); in addition, it demonstrated good test-retest reliability (study 5). Overall, the current study validated the scale as a useful tool for measuring appreciative joy, and certain findings also highlighted directions for future research on appreciative joy, including causal relationships with positive emotions, comparisons with compassion, and effects on envy.",65
"Background & Aims: miR-122 is the most abundant microRNA in the liver and regulates metabolic pathways including cholesterol biosynthesis, fatty acid synthesis, and oxidation. However, little is known about mechanisms that regulate the expression of miR-122 in the liver. The aim of this study was to identify key transcriptional regulators for miR-122 expression through intensively studying its primary transcript and promoter region. Methods: Bioinformatics analysis, Northern blotting, RT-PCR, and 5'/3' RACE were performed to analyze miR-122 primary transcript structure, its promoter region, and potential transacting factor binding sites. Reporter gene assays integrated with truncation and site-mutation in miR-122 promoter were performed to determine the trans-activation effect of HNF4 alpha to miR-122-promoter in vitro. ChIP and EMSA assays were performed to determine HNF4 alpha binding to miR-122 promoter. Finally, forced expression and RNAi were performed to verify the regulatory roles of HNF4 to miR-122 expression in vitro and in vivo. Results: Here, we show that miR-122 is processed from a long spliced primary transcript directed by a distal upstream promoter region conserved across species. We dissected this promoter region and identified putative binding sites for liver-enriched transcriptional factors that contribute to the regulation of miR-122 expression, including a putative binding site for hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4 alpha). We demonstrate that HNF4 alpha binds to the miR-122 promoter region through the conserved DR-I element. We observed the DR-1-element-dependent activation effect of HNF4 alpha on the conserved miR-122 promoter and the activation could be further enhanced by the addition of PGC1 alpha. Using overexpression and knockdown strategies, we show that HNF4 alpha positively regulates miR-122 expression in both Huh7 cells and the mouse liver. Conclusions: Our results suggest that HNF4 alpha is a key regulator of miR-122 expression in the liver. 2011 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier B.V.

"There is considerable interest in coloured fruits and berries as sources of biologically active anthocyanins. To examine the relationship between the oral close and the amount excreted for anthocyanins from a food source across a physiological range of doses, volunteers were fed, in random order, four portions (100-400 g) of fresh strawberries as part of a standard breakfast. Urine was collected at 2 h intervals up to 8 h, and for the period 8-24 h. Fresh strawberries contained pelargonidin-3-glucoside as the major anthocyanin with smaller amounts of cyanidin-3-glucoside and pelargonidin-3-rutinoside. Anthocyanins were detected in the urine of all volunteers for all doses, predominantly as pelargonidin glucuronide and sulphate metabolites. There was a strong, linear relationship between oral dose and anthocyanin excretion (Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient = 0.692, p < 0.001, n = 40) which indicated that on an average, every additional unit of dose caused 0.0166 units of excretion. Within individuals, dose - excretion data fitted a linear regression model (median R-2 = 0.93) We conclude that strawberry anthocyanins are partially bioavailable in humans with a linear relationship between oral dose and urinary excretion for doses up to 400 g fresh fruit.",32
"Female hormones play a significant role in the etiology and treatment of many women's health conditions. This article focuses on the common uses of hormonal therapy. When prescribing estrogen-containing regimens throughout the span of a woman's life, the risks are similar (ie, cardiovascular risk and venous thromboembolism), but the degree of risk varies significantly depending on a woman's particular set of risk factors and the details of the hormone regimen. In addition to estrogens and progestogens, this article also touches on the use of selective steroid receptor modulators in emergency contraception and in treatment of menopause symptoms.",124
"Currently, mankind is afflicted with diversified health issues, allergies being a common, yet little understood malady. Allergies, the outcome of a baffled immune system encompasses myriad allergens and causes an array of health consequences, ranging from transient to recurrent and mild to fatal. Indoor allergy is a serious hypersensitivity in genetically predisposed people, triggered by ingestion, inhalation or mere contact of allergens, of which mite and cockroaches are one of the most-represented constituents. Arduous to eliminate, these aeroallergens pose constant health challenges, mostly manifested as respiratory and dermatological inflammations, leading to further aggravations if unrestrained. Recent times have seen an unprecedented endeavour to understand the conformation of these allergens, their immune manipulative ploys and other underlying causes of pathogenesis, most importantly therapies. Yet a large section of vulnerable people is ignorant of these innocuous-looking immune irritants, prevailing around them, and continues to suffer. This review aims to expedite this field by a concise, informative account of seminal findings in the past few years, with particular emphasis on leading frontiers like genome-wide association studies (GWAS), epitope mapping, metabolomics etc. Drawbacks linked to current approaches and solutions to overcome them have been proposed.

"The classification of self-inflicted skin lesions proposed by the European Society for Dermatology and Psychiatry (ESDaP) group generated questions with regard to specific treatments that could be recommended for such cases. The therapeutic guidelines in the current paper integrate new psychotherapies and psychotropic drugs without forgetting the most important relational characteristics required for dealing with people with these disorders. The management of self-inflicted skin lesions necessitates empathy and a doctor-patient relationship based on trust and confidence. Cognitive behavioural therapy and/or psychodynamic and psychoanalytic psychotherapy (alone, or combined with the careful use of psychotropic drugs) seem to achieve the best results in the most difficult cases. Relatively new therapeutic techniques, such as habit reversal and mentalization-based psychotherapy, may be beneficial in the treatment of skin picking syndromes.",70
"We present a novel numerical method to simulate crack growth in 3D, directly from the Computer-Aided Design (CAD) geometry of the component, without any mesh generation. The method is an isogeometric boundary element method (IGABEM) based on non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS). NURBS basis functions are used for the domain and crack representation as well as to approximate the physical quantities involved in the simulations. A stable quadrature scheme for singular integration is proposed to enhance the robustness of the method in dealing with highly distorted elements. Convergence studies in the crack opening displacement is performed for a ""penny-shaped crack and an elliptical crack. Two approaches to extract stress intensity factors (SIFs): the contour M integral and the virtual crack closure integral are compared using dual integral equations. The results show remarkable accuracy in the computed SIFs, leading to smooth crack paths and reliable fatigue lives, without requiring the generation of any mesh from the CAD model of the component under consideration.

"Application integration (AI) is the process of creating impartially designed application systems that operate collectively. On the whole, integration is not an easy task because developers have to combine disparate structural designs that include different data, process, and object models. Developers must also make a solution operate across several operating systems, middleware technologies, and databases. Integration is essential for any new technology solution. This study discusses different approaches, feasible solutions, and estimates for disparate enterprise solution synchronization. We also discuss influential forces that have made enterprise AI precarious and summarize inspection areas when selecting a method for individual enterprise requirements. Moreover, we provide important aspects of AI that should be considered before planning and creating an integration solution.",68
"Programming is one of the most important areas in computer science. Based on many researches, it was found that the programming subject has the highest failure rate in universities. Hence, several studies had emphasized the importance of introducing programming from the early years of education. A game-based approach is used in this study by focusing on primary school students. A literature survey and an exploratory case study were executed by implementing several learning activities using games. Questionnaires were later distributed to these students after the activities were completed. The findings of this research listed some common game-based approach in introductory computer programming and learners' preferences towards games for upper primary school students. The results of this study can be used as the basis for the development of appropriate games that are suitable to the students' age and level.",40

"Light Emitting Diode (LED) luminaires provide compelling benefits such as long-term cost savings, and safety advantages through longer life and durability. LED luminaires have lower maintenance costs, and improved instant restrike capability when compared to legacy luminaire types. In industrial applications, the proven lower total cost of ownership and increased safety for LEDs are the driving forces for LED luminaires to replace traditional light sources. As with any new technology, challenges exist in designing and maintaining an optimal system to withstand the intended application and environmental conditions. Common challenges and considerations include luminaire placement, the intensity/dispersion/quality of light, thermal management, material selection, and redundant safety and operating systems. The authors will examine best practices and common misconceptions in the selection and application of LED luminaires focusing on process and harsh/hazardous locations. The probability of success in maximizing reliability, safety & efficiency of LED technology in such applications is enhanced by utilizing proven design principles & methods. The selection methods and design principles will be explained using actual application examples and case studies.",68
"Background: A combined supplement of vitamins B9 and B12 was reported to increase milk and milk component yields of dairy cows without effect on feed intake. The present study was undertaken to verify whether this supplementation positively modifies the pathways involved in milk and milk component synthesis. Thus, by studying the transcriptome activity in these tissues, the effect of supplements of both vitamins on the metabolism of both liver and mammary gland, was investigated. For this study, 24 multiparous Holstein dairy cows were assigned to 6 blocks of 4 animals each according to previous 305-day milk production. Within each block, cows were randomly assigned to weekly intramuscular injections of 5 mL of either saline 0.9 % NaCl, 320 mg of vitamin B9, 10 mg of vitamin B12 or a combination of both vitamins (B9 + B12). The experimental period began 3 weeks before the expected calving date and lasted 9 weeks of lactation. Liver and mammary biopsies were performed on lactating dairy cows 64 +/- 3 days after calving. Samples from both tissues were analyzed by microarray and qPCR to identify genes differentially expressed in hepatic and mammary tissues. Results: Microarray analysis identified 47 genes in hepatic tissue and 16 genes in the mammary gland whose expression was modified by the vitamin supplements. Gene ontology (GO) categorizes genes in non-overlapping domains of molecular biology. Panther is one of the online GO resources used for gene function classification. It classifies the 63 genes according to Molecular Function, Biological Process and Protein Class. Most of the biological processes modulated by the vitamin supplements were associated to developmental process, protein metabolic process, transport and response to inflammation. In the liver, most of the genes modulated by the vitamin treatments involved protein metabolic process while developmental process appeared to be more affected by the treatments in mammary gland. Out of 25 genes analysed by qPCR, 7 were validated. Conclusion: The results indicate that several metabolic processes were modulated by the supplementation of vitamins in early-lactating dairy cows. In addition, the results suggest that the vitamin supplements promoted liver regeneration and reduced catabolism of lipids in early lactation.",30
"Despite providing water-related services as the primary purpose of urban water system (UWS), all relevant activities require capital investments and operational expenditures, consume resources (e.g. materials and chemicals), and may increase negative environmental impacts (e.g. contaminant discharge, emissions to water and air). Performance assessment of such a metabolic system may require developing a holistic approach which encompasses various system elements and criteria. This paper analyses the impact of integration of UWS components on the metabolism based performance assessment for future planning using a number of intervention strategies. It also explores the importance of sustainability based criteria in the assessment of long-term planning. Two assessment approaches analysed here are: (1) planning for only water supply system (WSS) as a part of the UWS and (2) planning for an integrated UWS including potable water, stormwater, wastewater and water recycling. WaterMet(2) model is used to simulate metabolic type processes in the UWS and calculate quantitative performance indicators. The analysis is demonstrated on the problem of strategic level planning of a real-world UWS to where optional intervention strategies are applied. The resulting performance is assessed using the multiple criteria of both conventional and sustainability type; and optional intervention strategies are then ranked using the Compromise Programming method. The results obtained show that the high ranked intervention strategies in the integrated UWS are those supporting both water supply and stormwater/wastewater subsystems (e.g. rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling schemes) whilst these strategies are ranked low in the WSS and those targeting improvement of water supply components only (e.g. rehabilitation of clean water pipes and addition of new water resources) are preferred instead. Results also demonstrate that both conventional and sustainability type performance indicators are necessary for strategic planning in the UWS. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",95
"This study examined gender differences among homeless young adults' coping strategies and homelessness stressors as they relate to legal (e.g., full-time employment, selling personal possessions, selling blood/plasma) and illegal economic activity (e.g., selling drugs, theft, prostitution). A sample of 601 homeless young adults was recruited from 3 cities (Los Angeles, CA [n = 200], Austin, TX [n = 2001, and Denver, CO [n = 201]) to participate in semi-structured interviews from March 2010 to July 2011. Risk and resilience correlates of legal and illegal economic activity were analyzed using six Ordinary Least Squares regression models with the full sample and with the female and male sub-samples. In the full sample, three variables (i.e., avoidant coping, problem-focused coping, and mania) were associated with legal income generation whereas eight variables (i.e., social coping, age, arrest history, transience, peer substance use, antisocial personality disorder [ASPD], substance use disorder [SUD], and major depressive episode [MDE]) were associated with illegal economic activity. In the female sub-sample, three variables (i.e., problem-focused coping, race/ethnicity, and transience) were correlated with legal income generation whereas six variables (i.e., problem-focused coping, social coping, age, arrest history, peer substance use, and ASPD) were correlated with illegal economic activity. Among males, the model depicting legal income generation was not significant yet seven variables (i.e., social coping, age, transience, peer substance use, ASPD, SUD, and MDE) were associated with illegal economic activity. Understanding gender differences in coping strategies and economic activity might help customize interventions aimed at safe and legal income generation for this population. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"Flexible thermoelectric materials are prepared by melt mixing technique, which can be easily scaled up to industrial level. Hybrid filler systems of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and copper oxide (CuO), which are environmental friendly materials and contain abundant earth elements, are melt mixed into a thermoplastic matrix, namely polypropylene (PP). With the CNT addition, an electrical network could be built up inside the insulating PP for effective charge transport. The effect of CuO addition is determined by the corresponding CNT concentration. At high CNT concentration, largely above the percolation threshold (phi c, ca. 0.1 wt%), the change in the TE properties is small. In contrast, at CNT concentration close to phi c, the co-addition of CuO could simultaneously increase the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient. With 5 wt% CuO and 0.8 wt% CNTs where a loose percolated network is formed, the Seebeck coefficient was increased from 34.1 mu V/K to 45 mu V/K while the electrical conductivity was from 1.6 x 10(-3) S/cm to 3.8 x 10(-3) S/cm, leading to a power factor of 9.6 x 10(-4) mu W/mK(2) (cf. 1.8 x 10(-4) mu W/mK(2) for the composite with only 0.8 wt% CNTs).",50
"Background: Intensive insulin treatment is bothersome in obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. High insulin dosages further increase weight gain and the risk of hypoglycemia. Glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonists decrease the insulin need, cause weight loss and reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. There is limited data about the effect of exenatide on obese diabetics under intensive insulin regimens. Methods: This retrospective case series report the clinical outcomes of 23 obese (13 morbidly obese) patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (Age = 59 +/- 10.44 years, body mass index 41.1 +/- 6.8 kg/m(2), HbA1c 9.9 +/- 1.5 %), under high dose (94.1 +/- 39.6 unit) intensive insulin. Exenatide twice daily was added for a mean follow-up period of 11.22 +/- 7.01 (3-30) months. Intensive insulin regimens were continued in 7 patients while the others were switched to basal insulin during the follow-up. Results: During the follow-up, mean HbA1c levels of the patients significantly improved (p = 0.019), along with the significant decrease in body mass index and the total insulin need (p < 0.001 for both). Baseline insulin dosages were significantly higher in the intensive regimen group (p = 0.013) while other demographical and clinical characteristics were similar. No significant difference was present between the groups regarding the alterations of HbA1c, body mass index and the reduction in total insulin dosages. Conclusion: Add on exenatide appears to be a rational treatment modality in uncontrolled obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus despite intensive insulin regimens. Further prospective randomized studies with longer follow-up periods are recommended.",121
"Human aggression encompasses a wide range of behaviors and is related to many psychiatric disorders. We introduce the different classification systems of aggression and related disorders as a basis for discussing biochemical biomarkers and then present an overview of studies in humans (published between 1990 and 2015) that reported statistically significant associations of biochemical biomarkers with aggression, DSM-IV disorders involving aggression, and their subtypes. The markers are of different types, including inflammation markers, neurotransmitters, lipoproteins, and hormones from various classes. Most studies focused on only a limited portfolio of biomarkers, frequently a specific class only. When integrating the data, it is clear that compounds from several biological pathways have been found to be associated with aggressive behavior, indicating complexity and the need for a broad approach. In the second part of the paper, using examples from the aggression literature and psychiatric metabolomics studies, we argue that a better understanding of aggression would benefit from a more holistic approach such as provided by metabolomics.

"The Leon Springs pupfish (Cyprinodon bovinus) is an endangered species currently restricted to a single desert spring and a separate captive habitat in southwestern North America. Following establishment of the captive population from wild stock in 1976, the wild population has undergone natural population size fluctuations, intentional culling to purge genetic contamination from an invasive congener (Cyprinodon variegatus) and augmentation/replacement of wild fish from the captive stock. A severe population decline following the most recent introduction of captive fish prompted us to examine whether the captive and wild populations have differentiated during the short time they have been isolated from one another. If so, the development of divergent genetic and/or morphologic traits between populations could contribute to a diminished ability of fish from one location to thrive in the other. Examination of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms and morphologic variation revealed no evidence of residual C. variegatus characteristics in contemporary C. bovinus samples. However, significant genetic and morphologic differentiation was detected between the wild and captive populations, some of which might reflect local adaptation. Our results indicate that genetic and physical characteristics can diverge rapidly between isolated subdivisions of managed populations, potentially compromising the value of captive stock for future supplementation efforts. In the case of C. bovinus, our findings underscore the need to periodically inoculate the captive population with wild genetic material to help mitigate genetic, and potentially morphologic, divergence between them and also highlight the utility of parallel morphologic and genomic evaluation to inform conservation management planning.",34
"Both an accurate machine design and an adequate metrology loop definition are critical factors when precision positioning represents a key issue for the final system performance. This article discusses the error budget methodology as an advantageous technique to improve the measurement accuracy of a 2D-long range stage during its design phase. The nanopositioning platform NanoPla is here presented. Its specifications, e.g., XY-travel range of 50 mm x 50 mm and sub-micrometric accuracy; and some novel designed solutions, e.g., a three-layer and two-stage architecture are described. Once defined the prototype, an error analysis is performed to propose improvement design features. Then, the metrology loop of the system is mathematically modelled to define the propagation of the different sources. Several simplifications and design hypothesis are justified and validated, including the assumption of rigid body behavior, which is demonstrated after a finite element analysis verification. The different error sources and their estimated contributions are enumerated in order to conclude with the final error values obtained from the error budget. The measurement deviations obtained demonstrate the important influence of the working environmental conditions, the flatness error of the plane mirror reflectors and the accurate manufacture and assembly of the components forming the metrological loop. Thus, a temperature control of +/- 0.1 degrees C results in an acceptable maximum positioning error for the developed NanoPla stage, i.e., 41 nm, 36 nm and 48 nm in X-, Y- and Z-axis, respectively.",85
"Introduction: Preeclampsia (PE) is a life-threatening pregnancy disorder characterized by wide-spread endothelial dysfunction. Placental factors circulating in the maternal blood are believed to cause endothelial dysfunction. Our previous study identified HtrA4 as a placenta-specific serine protease that is released into the maternal circulation and significantly increased in early-onset PE. In this study, we examined the impact of HtrA4 on expression of endothelial genes related to vessel biology, using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as a model. Methods: HUVECs were treated with 0 or 3 mu g/ml HtrA4 (highest concentration seen in PE circulation) for 24 h and analysed by an endothelial cell biology PCR array containing 84 genes. HtrA4-induced changes were then validated by real-time RT-PCR and ELISA for time and dose dependency. Results: High levels of HtrA4 significantly altered the expression of a range of genes related to inflammation, vaso-activity, angiogenesis, cell adhesion, platelet activation and coagulation. In particular, pro inflammatory genes 1L6, PTGS2 (COX2) and MB were significantly increased by HtrA4. IL6 protein in HUVEC media was also drastically increased. THBD, an anticoagulant factor reported to be increased in PE, was significantly up-regulated by HtrA4. In contrast, THBS1, which is involved in many regulatory processes of endothelial cell biology, was severely down-regulated by HtrA4. Discussion: HtrA4 significantly increased the inflammatory responses of HUVECs, and altered their expression of a number of genes important for vessel biology. These data suggest that placenta-derived HtrA4 that is increased in PE circulation is a potential causal factor of endothelial dysfunction. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",31
"Objective Telomeres are regions at the ends of chromosomes that maintain chromosomal structural integrity and genomic stability. In studies of mainly older, white populations, shorter leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is associated with cardiometabolic risk factors and increased risks of mortality and coronary heart disease (CHD). On average, African Americans (AfAm) have longer LTL than whites, but the LTL-CHD relationship in AfAm is unknown. We investigated the relationship of LTL with CHD and mortality among AfAm. Approach and Results Using a case-cohort design, 1525 postmenopausal women (667 AfAm and 858 whites) from the Women's Health Initiative had LTL measured in baseline blood samples by Southern blotting. CHD or mortality hazards ratios were estimated using race-stratified and risk factor-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. There were 367 incident CHD (226 mortality) events in whites, whereas AfAm experienced 269 incident CHD (216 mortality) events during median follow-up of 13 years. Shorter LTL was associated with older age, current smoking, and white race/ethnicity. In whites, each 1 kilobase decrease in LTL was associated with 50% increased hazard of CHD, hazard ratio=1.50 (95% confidence interval, 1.08-2.10), P=0.017. There was no association between CHD and LTL in AfAm. White women with shorter LTL had higher risks of mortality. In contrast, shorter LTL was weakly associated with decreased mortality hazard in AfAm. Conclusions As one of the largest prospective studies of LTL associations with incident CHD and mortality in a racially diverse sample, our study suggests differences in LTL associations with CHD and mortality between white and AfAm postmenopausal women.",39
"Infants at risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may have difficulty integrating smiles into initiating joint attention (IJA) bids. A specific IJA pattern, anticipatory smiling, may communicate preexisting positive affect when an infant smiles at an object and then turns the smile toward the social partner. We compared the development of anticipatory smiling at 8, 10, and 12 months in infant siblings of children with ASD (high-risk siblings) and without ASD (low-risk siblings). High-risk siblings produced less anticipatory smiling than low-risk siblings, suggesting early differences in communicating preexisting positive affect. While early anticipatory smiling distinguished the risk groups, IJA not accompanied by smiling best predicted later severity of ASD-related behavioral characteristics among high-risk siblings. High-risk infants appear to show lower levels of motivation to share positive affect with others. However, facility with initiating joint attention in the absence of a clear index of positive affective motivation appears to be central to the prediction of ASD symptoms.",64
"This paper describes the development of a simulation model in state space representation for a class of microwave heating model. Under the assumptions on thermodynamics mechanism, one-dimensional heating model in rectangle waveguide is derived by combining Lambert's law and heat conduction equation. Through introducing the spatial differential operator in inhomogeneous thermal conduction equation, one-dimensional heating model in form of partial differential equations (PDE) can be divided into finite-dimensional slow one and infinite-dimensional complement, which provides a application for Galerkin's method to transform the PDE into state space form. The simulation of state space model has shown that the trend and distribution of temperature are in good agreement with that of traditional numerical model.",58
"Since the end of the 1990s, rainwater harvesting (RWH) has been growing in France. A first regulatory framework, constituted mainly by an Order of 21 August, 2008, helped to strengthen this practice, but also introduced some limitations to the development of RWH. Considering the growing social demand and possible issues for water resources, it is likely that this first regulatory framework will evolve. In order to anticipate these changes, foreign case studies may be very instructive. Based on a detailed analysis of eight countries in all continents (Germany, United Kingdom, United States, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka, Australia and Uganda), this paper draws up an international overview of RWH allowing French practices to be put into perspective. Beyond the specific and sensitive differences, the experience of these countries gives useful lessons for the French case. Comparisons have been drawn on different topics: uses of rainwater, quality standards, regulatory tools and RWH development factors. RWH, especially, in urban areas appears in France as an isolated topic. It is necessary in the future to better integrate it into overall urban water management approaches.",95
"Background: Microbial genomes at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) represent a large collection of more than 35,000 assemblies. There are several complexities associated with the data: a great variation in sampling density since human pathogens are densely sampled while other bacteria are less represented; different protein families occur in annotations with different frequencies; and the quality of genome annotation varies greatly. In order to extract useful information from these sophisticated data, the analysis needs to be performed at multiple levels of phylogenomic resolution and protein similarity, with an adequate sampling strategy. Results: Protein clustering is used to construct meaningful and stable groups of similar proteins to be used for analysis and functional annotation. Our approach is to create protein clusters at three levels. First, tight clusters in groups of closely-related genomes (species-level clades) are constructed using a combined approach that takes into account both sequence similarity and genome context. Second, clustroids of conservative in-clade clusters are organized into seed global clusters. Finally, global protein clusters are built around the the seed clusters. We propose filtering strategies that allow limiting the protein set included in global clustering. The in-clade clustering procedure, subsequent selection of clustroids and organization into seed global clusters provides a robust representation and high rate of compression. Seed protein clusters are further extended by adding related proteins. Extended seed clusters include a significant part of the data and represent all major known cell machinery. The remaining part, coming from either non-conservative (unique) or rapidly evolving proteins, from rare genomes, or resulting from low-quality annotation, does not group together well. Processing these proteins requires significant computational resources and results in a large number of questionable clusters. Conclusion: The developed filtering strategies allow to identify and exclude such peripheral proteins limiting the protein dataset in global clustering. Overall, the proposed methodology allows the relevant data at different levels of details to be obtained and data redundancy eliminated while keeping biologically interesting variations.",101
"Wearable devices have emerged in the last years with new applications that provide user convenience. Healthcare, sports, safety are some examples of applications embedded in thousands of devices released in the last years. Wearable operating systems with different focus emerged together with wearable applications in order to make adjustments and optimizations of software and hardware. This paper presents a wearable operating systems discussion and shows the current challenges and wearable operating system influence. We developed a wearable appliance for geology. The wearable contains a Head Mounted Display (HMD) assembled with Google Cardboard API and sensors connected to developments boards. For each system component was used different operating systems according to hardware and software available. The results indicate some trends for wearable operating systems.",68
"The issue of testability, intended as a measure of solvability of the parametric fault diagnosis problem in analog linear time-invariant electrical networks, is addressed in this paper. Independently of the considered fault location method, such important metric provides information as to how many and which components can be diagnosed. For the reader's convenience and to set up an appropriate framework for our main achievements, our first concern is to rederive fundamental results concerning analog linear time-invariant electrical network testability hinging on multifrequency measurements. Then a novel algorithm for testability analysis is proposed, which is straightforward and able to circumvent the main drawbacks of formerly proposed methods, such as computational and conceptual complexities, proneness to roundoff errors, and vulnerability to particular cases. A computer program that implements such algorithm is also described. Moreover, the possibility of employing further simplified versions of the latter and their links with a previously proposed approach are discussed on rigorous bases. Finally, examples are provided, which show the effectiveness and robustness of the new algorithms, also by means of a comparison with the old ones. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",50
"Context: Dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ) which is originally developed as an analog of antibiotic epoxyquinomicin C is a specific and potent inhibitor of NF-kappa B and has been shown to possess promising potential as an anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor agent. Objective: This study examines DHMEQ's effect on therapeutic potential for atopic dermatitis (AD)-like lesions. Materials and methods: AD lesions were chronically induced by the repetitive and alternative application of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) and oxazolone (OX) on ears in BALB/c mice. The mice were then externally treated with DHMEQ ointment. Macroscopic and microscopic changes of the skin lesions were observed and recorded. Results: DHMEQ inhibited ear swelling and relieved clinical symptoms of the AD-like lesions induced by DNCB/OX in BALB/c mice. Histopathology examination illustrated that it significantly decreased DNCB/OX-induced epidermal thickness, the infiltration of inflammatory cells, and the count of mast cell. The elevated level of immunoglobulin E (IgE) in serum and the mRNA levels of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin 4 (IL-4) and IL-13 in the ear tissues, were also suppressed by DHMEQ. Discussion and conclusion: This study indicated that DHMEQ would be useful for the treatment of AD.",110
"The RECCo control algorithm, presented in this article, is based on the fuzzy rule-based (FRB) system named ANYA which has non-parametric antecedent part. It starts with zero fuzzy rules (clouds) in the rule base and evolves its structure while performing the control of the plant. For the consequent part of RECCo PID-type controller is used and the parameters are adapted in an online manner. The RECCo does not require any off-line training or any type of model of the controlled process (e.g. differential equations). Moreover, in this article we propose a normalization of the cloud (data) space and an improved adaptation law of the controller. Due to the normalization some of the evolving parameters can be fixed while the new adaptation law improves the performance of the controller in the starting phase of the process control. To assess the performance of the RECCo algorithm, firstly a comparison study with classical PID controller was performed on a model of a plate heat-exchanger (PHE). Tuning the PID parameters was done using three different techniques (Ziegler-Nichols, Cohen-Coon and pole placement). Furthermore, a practical implementation of the RECCo controller for a real PHE plant is presented. The PHE system has nonlinear static characteristic and a time delay. Additionally, the real sensor's and actuator's limitations represent a serious problem from the control point of view. Besides this, the RECCo control algorithm autonomously learns and evolves the structure and adapts its parameters in an online unsupervised manner. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",59
"The symbiotic interaction between legume plants and rhizobia results in the formation of root nodules, in which symbiotic plant cells host and harbor thousands of nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. Here, a Medicago truncatula nodules with activated defense 1 (nad1) mutant was identified using reverse genetics methods. The mutant phenotype was characterized using cell and molecular biology approaches. An RNA-sequencing technique was used to analyze the transcriptomic reprogramming of nad1 mutant nodules. In the nad1 mutant plants, rhizobial infection and propagation in infection threads are normal, whereas rhizobia and their symbiotic plant cells become necrotic immediately after rhizobia are released from infection threads into symbiotic cells of nodules. Defense-associated responses were detected in nad1 nodules. NAD1 is specifically present in root nodule symbiosis plants with the exception of Morus notabilis, and the transcript is highly induced in nodules. NAD1 encodes a small uncharacterized protein with two predicted transmembrane helices and is localized at the endoplasmic reticulum. Our data demonstrate a positive role for NAD1 in the maintenance of rhizobial endosymbiosis during nodulation.",30
"Terrain data can be processed from the double perspective of computer graphics and graph theory. We propose a hybrid method that uses geometrical and vertex attribute information to construct a weighted graph reflecting the variability of the vertex data. As a planar graph, a generic terrain data set is subjected to a geometry-sensitive vertex partitioning procedure. Through the use of a combined, thin-plate energy and multi-dimensional quadric metric error, feature estimation heuristic, we construct even' and odd' node subsets. Using an invertible lifting scheme, adapted from generic weighted graphs, detail vectors are extracted and used to recover or filter the node information. The design of the prediction and update filters improves the root mean squared error of the signal over general graph-based approaches. As a key property of this design, preserving the mean of the graph signal becomes essential for decreasing the error measure and conserving the salient shape features.",79
"Objective: To analyze the usefulness of rapid HIV testing in pregnant patients in the delivery room. Methods: This prospective study compared a rapid test and a fourth-generation enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) for HIV screening among pregnant patients admitted in labor with an unknown HIV status at a university hospital in Mexico between July 2015 and February 2016. Pearson correlation analysis was performed, and the diagnostic accuracy of the two tests was assessed with HIV RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as the reference method. Results: Overall, 534 patients were included. With a signal-to-cutoff (S/CO) value of 1.0 or more as a diagnostic criterion, 6 (1.1%) patients had a positive ELISA result. Three had a negative rapid test and three had a positive test (r=0.705). With an S/CO value of 2.0 or more as cutoff, 4 (0.7%) patients had a positive ELISA result. Three had a positive rapid test and one had a negative test (r=0.865). Only three of six patients with an S/CO of 1.0 or more were confirmed to have HIV by RNA PCR. Conclusion: The rapid test showed a strong correlation with the fourth-generation ELISA. Therefore, rapid testing is a useful tool in the delivery room for patients with unknown HIV status.",37
Wood is a widely used material in various applications where its dimensional stability is of practical interest in the design and performance of wooden materials. The change in geometry of wood depends upon the environmental conditions (such as relative humidity) as well as internal structure and composition of wood. This work presents a measurement technique and development of the associated system for the measurement of strain changes of wood samples with relative humidity. The developed system is capable of measuring the strain change and relative humidity (RH) with temperature compensation. The system comprises of strain gauge based strain measurement unit and RH sensor with its related signal conditioning circuit along with temperature sensor. The strain gauge signal conditioning is based on quarter bridge method with high precision resistors which is excited by an AC source. The whole system is centered on an 8-bit RISC microcontroller (PIC18F43K22). The built in 10-bit analog to digital converter (ADC) is used to read the strain and ambient RH. The temperature is directly read from temperature to digital converter using ZACwire (TM) interface. The measurement system is calibrated using a cantilever of stainless steel and is used for collecting and analyzing data of four wood samples. The uncertainties associated with the measurements are reported in the paper. Experimental results obtained for a few wood samples are presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.,51
"Cancer is a serious hazard to human health all around the world; however, many current therapies remain toxic and poor. In view of the understanding of immunology and tumor biology, cancer immunotherapy with minimal toxicity has been regarded as a promising strategy for cancer treatment because of immune surveillance. Unfortunately, the efficacy of immunotherapy was impeded and resisted due to the tumor immune evasion mechanism. Hence, targeted cancer immunotherapy has been proposed to tackle the tumor immune suppression and complexity of malignant tumor cells. Nanotechnology-based immunotherapy has improved the limitations and enhanced the therapeutic efficiency of traditional immunotherapy. This review illustrates the recent progresses in immunotherapy based on nanotechnology, and reveals that nanodevices could be utilized for active and passive cancer immunotherapy.",33
"The use of convex relaxations has lately gained considerable interest in Power Systems. These relaxations play a major role in providing quality guarantees for non-convex optimization problems. For the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem, the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation is known to produce tight lower bounds. Unfortunately, SDP solvers still suffer from a lack of scalability. In this work, we introduce an exact reformulation of the SDP relaxation, formed by a set of polynomial constraints defined in the space of real variables. The new constraints can be seen as ""cuts"", strengthening weaker second-order cone relaxations, and can be generated in a lazy iterative fashion. The new formulation can be handled by standard nonlinear programming solvers, enjoying better stability and computational efficiency. This new approach benefits from recent results on tree-decomposition methods, reducing the dimension of the underlying SDP matrices. As a side result, we present a formulation of Kirchhoff's Voltage Law in the SDP space and reveal the existing link between these cycle constraints and the original SDP relaxation for three dimensional matrices. Preliminary results show a significant gain in computational efficiency compared to a standard SDP solver approach.",47
"In the last fifteen years, Europe has been involved in the major development of photovoltaic (PV) solar energy. The Kyoto Protocol requirements and the European Union (EU) directives to promote the use of renewable energy sources (RES) together with environmental policies introduced for the development and use of alternative energies have generated a large number of market opportunities for this sector. Differences in the application of energy policies have caused significant imbalances in electricity systems and distortion of electricity prices. The main concern of governments is to define the support schemes to be used and how to combine them in the most profitable manner. The aim of this paper is to provide a comparative cost-effectiveness assessment using feed-in tariffs (FiT) and net-metering (NM) schemes in some representative EU countries. The authors have developed an economic model to evaluate the profitability of PV projects combining these support schemes. Results show not only the circumstances under which solar energy is economically profitable, but also the kind of PV systems, locations, minimum levels of tariff prices and specific combination of support schemes that should be promoted.",100
"The purpose of this study is to identify several responsible parameters for back pain (BP) in youth soccer players to create a risk assessment tool for early prevention.An iPad-based survey was used to screen for parameters in a cross-sectional study. This questionnaire includes items regarding anthropometric data, training habits and sports injuries and was put into practice with 1110 athletes. Sex (odds ratio (OR): 1.84), age group (1.48) and playing surface (1.56) were significantly associated with BP. A history of injuries especially to the spine and hip/groin increased the likelihood for evolving recurrent BP (1.74/1.40). Overall 15 factors seem to influence the appearance of pain and were integrated into a feasible nomogram. The nomogram provides a practical tool to identify the risks of developing BP for youth soccer players. Although most factors we identified are non-modifiable, this method allows to rank the importance of factors and especially their prevention treatments for athletes.",27
"Eating disorders hold a unique place among mental health disorders, in that salient symptoms can be objectively observed and measured rather than determined only from patient interviews or subjective evaluations. Because of this measurement advantage alone, evidence-based medicine would be expected there to make the most rapid strides. However, conclusions in Eating Disorders research, as in all medical research literature, often continue to be misleading or ambiguous. One major and long-known source of such problems is the misuse and misinterpretation of "" statistical significance"", with "" p values"" strewn throughout research papers like so much confetti, a problem that has become systemic, that is, enforced, rather than corrected, by the peer-review system. This discussion attempts to clarify the issues, and to suggest how readers might deal with this issue in processing the research literature.",67
"Tissue P systems with symport/antiport rules are a class of distributed parallel computing models inspired by the cell intercommunication in tissues, where objects are never modified in the process of communication, just changing their place within the system. In this work, a variant of tissue P systems, called tissue P systems with evolutional symport/antiport rules is introduced, where objects are moved from one region to another region and may be evolved during this process. The computational power of such P systems is studied. Specifically, it is proved that such P systems with one cell and using evolutional symport rules of length at most 3 or using evolutional antiport rules of length at most 4 are Turing universal (only the family of all finite sets of positive integers can be generated by such P systems if standard symport/antiport rules are used). Moreover, cell division rules are considered in tissue P systems with evolutional symport/antiport rules, and a limit on the efficiency of such P systems is provided with evolutional communication rules of length at most 2. The computational efficiency of this kind of models is shown when using evolutional communication rules of length at most 4. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",101
"Triangle meshes are the most common representation of an object in the field of computer graphics. Recently, they have found their way into the field of erosion simulation, where volumetric representation used to prevail. Real-life erosion scenes are usually formed of multiple materials and so a reliable means of material definition is needed. Unfortunately, coupling the material information with a triangle mesh is not as straightforward as in the volumetric case. This paper proposes an approach for multiple material definition based on space subdivision. Binary space partitioning (BSP) is used to simulate complex multi material scenes. The approach allows the definition of a nontrivial scene composed of several materials, including the definition of a gradually changing material. A method for an automated creation of the BSP tree from input volumetric data is proposed. The construction algorithm extracts a triangle mesh as an intermediate product and uses its faces as the splitting planes of the BSP tree. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",79
"Recently, we have reported on a compact microcontroller-based unit developed to accurately synchronize excimer laser pulses (Mingesz et al. 2012 Fluct. Noise Lett. 11, 1240007 (doi:10.1142/S021947751240007X)). We have shown that dithering based on random jitter noise plus pseudorandom numbers can be used in the digital control system to radically reduce the long-term drift of the laser pulse from the trigger and to improve the accuracy of the synchronization. In this update paper, we present our new experimental results obtained by the use of the delay-controller unit to tune the timing of a KrF excimer laser as an addition to our previous numerical simulation results. The hardware was interfaced to the laser using optical signal paths in order to reduce sensitivity to electromagnetic interference and the control algorithm tested by simulations was applied in the experiments. We have found that the system is able to reduce the delay uncertainty very close to the theoretical limit and performs well in real applications. The simple, compact and flexible system is universal enough to also be used in various multidisciplinary applications.",48
"The purpose of the study was to examine whether scores on a widely used measure of hostilitythe Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory (BDHI)and change on this measure predicted sexual recidivism in a sample of 120 adult male incarcerated sexual offenders. Pre- and posttreatment scores, simple difference scores, and clinically significant change were examined. The majority of participants had functional scores on the BDHI prior to treatment. Of those who had dysfunctional pretreatment scores, the majority remained unchanged. Higher posttreatment scores on the Assault and Verbal Hostility subscales significantly predicted sexual recidivism. The remaining pre- and posttreatment scores as well as change scores and classifications did not significantly predict sexual recidivism. Our findings suggest that the Assault and Verbal Hostility subscales may be useful for predicting sexual recidivism but were not clearly consistent with the notion that the BDHI assesses a dynamic risk factor(s) for sexual recidivism. Due to a number of limitations of the current study, however, more rigorous research is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.",73
"Wound dressings play an important role in a patient's recovery from health problems, as unattended wounds could lead to serious complications such as infections or, ultimately, even death. Therefore, wound dressings since ancient times have been continuously developed, starting from simple dressings from natural materials for covering wounds to modern dressings with functionalized materials to aid in the wound healing process and enhance tissue repair. However, understanding the nature of a wound and the subsequent healing process is vital information upon which dressings can be tailored to ensure a patient's recovery. To date, much progress has been made through the use of nanomedicine in wound healing due to the ability of such materials to mimic the natural dimensions of tissue. This review provides an overview of recent studies on the physiology of wound healing and various wound dressing materials made of nanofibers fabricated using the electrospinning technique.",114
"Background: Early childhood is characterized by dramatic gains in emotion regulation skills that support social adjustment and mental health. Understanding the physiological substrates of healthy emotion regulation may offer new directions for altering trajectories toward initiation and escalation of substance abuse. Here, we describe the intersections between parasympathetic and sympathetic tone, emotion regulation and prosocial behavior in a high-risk sample of preschoolers. Method: Fifty-two 3-6 year old children completed an assessment of attention regulation in response to affective stimuli. Cardiac respiratory sinus arrhythmia, an index of parasympathetic tone, and pre-ejection period, a marker of sympathetic activation, were recorded at rest and while children engaged in social interactions with their mothers and an unfamiliar research assistant. Mothers reported on children's emotional reactivity and prosocial behavior. Results: Controlling for age and psychosocial risk, higher parasympathetic tone predicted better attention regulation in response to angry emotion and higher levels of prosocial behavior, whereas a reciprocal pattern of higher parasympathetic tone and lower sympathetic arousal predicted better attention in response to positive emotion and lower emotional reactivity. Children exposed to fewer risk factors and higher levels of maternal warmth were more able to sustain a high level of parasympathetic tone during interaction episodes. Conclusions: Findings suggest that autonomic measures represent biomarkers for socio-emotional competence in young children. They also point to the importance of early experiences in the establishment of physiological regulation and the promise of family-based intervention to promote healthy emotion regulation and prevent substance dependence in high-risk populations. 2016 University of Kentucky Center for Drug Abuse Research Translation.

"Purpose: Childhood cancer is stressful for the entire family. Preoccupation and anxiety surrounding the child's illness may result in parents of children with cancer being overprotective or less emotionally responsive toward their children. Such parenting in response to a negative life event like childhood cancer may cause survivors to be more insecurely attached than healthy peers, which could have downstream effects on survivors' romantic relationships later in life. Therefore, we examined survivors' perspectives on parent behaviors, adult attachment, and marital status among adult survivors of childhood cancer relative to controls. Methods: One hundred forty-nine young adult survivors and 149 matched controls (M-age=28, range 20-40) indicated their relationship status (single vs. partnered) and completed standardized questionnaires assessing memories of upbringing (warmth, overprotection, rejection) and adult attachment (avoidance, anxiety). Results: Adult survivors of childhood cancer remembered mothers and fathers as emotionally warmer (d=0.53/0.30), and mothers as less rejecting than controls (d=0.30). Adult attachment was overall similar between survivors and controls, but partnered survivors reported particularly low attachment-related anxiety. Childhood cancer was related to higher mother and father warmth, which were associated with lower attachment-related avoidance and in turn with a greater likelihood of being in a relationship. Conclusion: Adult childhood cancer survivors did not remember their parents as overprotective, but reported more positive parenting relative to controls; and similar adult attachment and relationship status. The results were unexpected, but offer novel insights for future prospective studies, which are necessary to better understand psychosocial late effects of childhood cancer.",18
"The analysis of pottery from the settlement Uttumer Escher is part of a DFG project which studies all riverside find complexes of the Roman Iron Age on the lower Weser and the lower Ems rivers in order to identify their possible function as wharves/piers. The pottery from Uttumer Escher stands out for their unusually high proportion of organically tempered ceramic ware reflecting a pottery variant, which is already known from other contemporary settlements astride the Ems. Typological comparisons and pottery analyses were conducted for a closer examination of this chronologically restricted and regional pottery tradition. They confirmed the already assumed peculiar manufacturing engineering. There is also frequent evidence for this pottery in the Dutch settlement area, although with different dating. A critical review of the basis of dating on the individual sites in both countries reveals that it could well be a contemporary phenomenon rendered possible by the necessity to add special temper to limey clay.",84
"As motion sensors are getting light-weighted and low-priced, there is a growing appetite for the accelerometer-based approaches for efficiently monitoring human activities. This paper proposes an original feature selection approach based on the spectral distances between a given signal and an activity model. This new technique is evaluated and compared to existing techniques in literature. This study also investigates the improvement of classification performances brought by the heart rate (HR) data in addition to the accelerometer data. The experimental dataset is composed of both acceleration and HR recordings from eight volunteers performing five ambulation activities. Four wearable sensor units, including an ECG node are employed. The response of the system to three widely used classifiers, the K-nearest neighbors K-NN, the Naive Bayes NB and the decision Tree C4.5 is reported along with the classification rates. The results reached up to 99% of overall recognition accuracy and higher than 98% using a single-sensor acceleration data and the HR data. These results demonstrate that the spectral distances approach can be adopted to accurately classify activities and that the joint processing of acceleration signals together with the HR signals can increase the classification accuracy compared to the case when processing the acceleration signals alone.

"This work presents the application of the comprehensive predictive modeling methodology for single multiphysics time-dependent systems, developed by Cacuci and Ionescu-Bujor (2010), to a paradigm spent fuel dissolver model of interest to nonproliferation objectives, in order to quantify uncertainties due to dissolver model parameters and subsequently to combine all of the available experimental and computational information to obtain best-estimate values for model responses and parameters, along with reduced predicted uncertainties. This predictive modeling methodology uses the maximum entropy principle to construct an optimal approximation of the unknown a priori distribution for the a priori known mean values and uncertainties characterizing the model parameters and the computed and experimentally measured model responses. This approximate a priori distribution is subsequently combined using Bayes' theorem with the likelihood provided by the multiphysics computational models. Finally, the posterior distribution is evaluated using the saddle-point method to obtain analytical expressions for the optimally predicted values for the parameters and responses of both multiphysics models, along with corresponding reduced uncertainties. The weighting functions used within this predictive modeling methodology are provided by the first-order sensitivities (i.e., functional derivatives) of the model's response with respect to the model's parameters. The dissolver model comprises 619 model parameters related to the model's equation of state and inflow conditions. The sensitivities to all model parameters of the acid concentrations at each of these instances in time were computed exactly and efficiently in an accompanying work by Peltz and Cacuci (2015), using the adjoint sensitivity analysis method. These sensitivities are used in this work to quantify the uncertainties in the acid concentration (system responses) in various dissolver compartments, arising from uncertainties in the model parameters. Subsequently, the sensitivities are used within the predictive modeling methodology to combine the computational results with the available experiments, which were performed solely in the compartment farthest from the inlet. The results of applying the predictive modeling methodology yield optimally calibrated values for all 619 model parameters, with reduced predicted uncertainties, as well as optimal (best-estimate) predicted values for the acid concentrations, also with reduced predicted uncertainties. Notably, even though the experimental data pertain solely to the compartment farthest from the inlet (where the data were measured), the predictive modeling methodology actually improves the predictions and reduces the predicted uncertainties not only in the compartment in which the data were actually measured but also throughout the entire dissolver, including the compartment farthest from the measurements (i.e., at the inlet). This is because the predictive modeling methodology combines and transmits information simultaneously over the entire phase-space, comprising all time steps and spatial locations. The results obtained in this work establish confidence in the dissolver model's accuracy for simulating the acid concentrations required to dissolve used nuclear fuel. In turn, these results will be used to generate source terms for key reprocessing facility components downstream and to support material accountability for nuclear safeguards.",83
"Privacy-preserving distributed machine learning becomes increasingly important due to the recent rapid growth of data. This paper focuses on a class of regularized empirical risk minimization machine learning problems, and develops two methods to provide differential privacy to distributed learning algorithms over a network. We first decentralize the learning algorithm using the alternating direction method of multipliers, and propose the methods of dual variable perturbation and primal variable perturbation to provide dynamic differential privacy. The two mechanisms lead to algorithms that can provide privacy guarantees under mild conditions of the convexity and differentiability of the loss function and the regularizer. We study the performance of the algorithms, and show that the dual variable perturbation outperforms its primal counterpart. To design an optimal privacy mechanism, we analyze the fundamental tradeoff between privacy and accuracy, and provide guidelines to choose privacy parameters. Numerical experiments using customer information database are performed to corroborate the results on privacy and utility tradeoffs and design.",2
"The refractive index is crucial in determining the detailed nature of the propagation of the electromagnetic waves in a medium. There is a growing demand for high resolution measurement of the refractive index because newly synthesized materials are usually small and optical devices and the elements of metamateirals are being miniaturized. In addition, the inhomogeneous broadening effects of organic materials cannot be described by the mathematical dielectric models, which are essential to extract the refractive index from conventional spectroscopic measurements. Here, we present a novel method called surface plasmonometry, which extracts the complex refractive index of a material using surface plasmons without any dielectric models. By changing the length of the nanoslot antennas, various plasmon modes are excited and coupled to the target material, which becomes a unique characteristic of the refractive index. Since the optical parameters can be extracted at each wavelength through a machine learning algorithm, mathematical dielectric models are not necessary. Furthermore, with the table-top Fourier transform infrared source and detector, we achieve 10 000 times enhancement of lateral resolution compared to conventional ellipsometry owing to the extreme locality of the surface plasmon and the normal incidence geometry. We also successfully demonstrate the label-free detection of the protein bilayer by surface plasmonometry, which opens an exciting new biosensing platform.",1
"Improvement of quality and value addition of agricultural produces has gained higher concern in recent times in Sri Lanka due to creation of new opportunities for sale of agricultural commodities in open market at competitive prices. Grading according to the sizes is an important value adding technique for most agricultural products. And also the price of the many agricultural products varies significantly according to their uniformity in size. Uniformity in size not only makes the produce more attractive to consumers but also improve its processing qualities. At present, size grading of most agricultural crops including big onion are carried out manually by crop collectors, whole sellers and retail sellers, most of farmers market their products without any grading. In Sri Lanka, persons engaging in post-harvest crop handling such as collectors, whole sellers, retail sellers, and farmers have less chance to use high technical and costly grading technique. And also local market survey reported, retail market price of the big onion bulbs are significantly varied according to its size. Hence, this research study attempted to design and development of a low cost size grading machine for size grading of big onion bulbs. Size grading machine was fabricated by cast iron and PVC tube and It was designed for grading of onion bulbs into three sizes i.e. small (phi<4 cm), medium (4 < phi6cm). Grading machine was also fabricated to operate either by manual or electric motor. The machine was tested for grading efficiency/quality accordingly, machine performance was optimized. Optimized machine adjustments for its maximum performance were 3 degrees inclined angle of the grading cylinder against horizontal axis and 15 rpm rotating speed of the grading cylinder. Maximum grading qualities/efficiencies under optimized machine adjustments for small, medium and large sizes were reported 84.47%, 93.46% and 90.14 respectively. The capacity of the grading machine was 630 kg/hour under the optimized operational conditions. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",53
"Leading organizational change involves many leadership skills. The literature indicates that there is one basic underlying skill: the ability to form and use judgment that is informed by analysis and experience. The literature also indicates that constructing and implementing good judgment from analysis and experience requires discretion in terms of autonomy and power. However, the findings from a field study of leaders with strong reputations as change agents demonstrated that it was difficult for change agents to have both autonomy and power. This result introduces critical but underexplored dilemmas associated with balancing autonomy and power in leading change. This article argues that balancing might occur when change agents have learned to understand and handle the dilemmas, and it describes enabling conditions for this learning. Furthermore, a future research agenda is indicated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",66
"Background: Systemic autoinflammatory diseases (SAIDs) represent a growing number of monogenic, polygenic or multifactorial disorders that are often difficult to diagnose. Case presentation: Here we report a patient who was initially erroneously diagnosed and treated for SAID. Symptoms consisted of recurrent fever, erythematous and/or blistering skin lesions, angioedema, susceptibility to bleeding, external ear infections and reversible anisocoria in the absence of laboratory evidence of systemic inflammation. After two and a half years of extensive diagnostic work-up and multiple empirical therapies, a final diagnosis of Munchausen by proxy syndrome (MBPS) was established. Conclusions: The diagnosis of SAID needs to be carefully reassessed if measurable systemic inflammation is missing, and MBPS should be included in the differential diagnosis.",76
"Purpose To evaluate the effect of bariatric arterial embolization (BAE) with non-spherical polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles on systemic ghrelin levels, weight change, and gastric ulceration risk in a swine model. Materials and Methods From March 2014 to February 2015, ten healthy swine were used in the study (mean weight 31.5 kg; range 24.0-41.5 kg). The animals were randomly assigned to two groups: the embolized group (n = 5) in which BAE was performed and the control group (n = 5). In the embolized group, BAE was performed by selectively infusing 150-250 or 50-150 mu m PVA into the gastric arteries that supplied the fundus of the stomach. In the control group, a sham procedure was performed with saline infusion. Plasma ghrelin levels were prospectively obtained at baseline and every 2 weeks thereafter. Endoscopy was performed 3 weeks after BAE to see whether any gastric ulcer occurred. To determine the durability of the occluded arteries, repeated celiac trunk angiography was performed 8 weeks after BAE. Then, all the swine were killed and necropsies were performed. Results The mean post-procedure ghrelin value decreased by 370.0 pg/mL in the embolized group at week 3 (mean 536.0 +/- 334.3 pg/mL) and week 5 (mean 515.0 +/- 150.0 pg/mL, p < 0.05) relative to baseline (880.0 +/- 559.5 pg/mL), respectively, but ghrelin levels were not significantly decreased between the embolized and control groups. There was a significant body weight change as follows: 35.1 +/- 9.5 to 46.6 +/- 15.7 kg and 31.8 +/- 5.8 to 41.2 +/- 6.6 kg at baseline and endpoint in the control and embolized groups, respectively (p < 0.05). However, the difference between groups was not significant at endpoint. In the embolized group, ulcerations were identified in three animals (60%) and the recanalization of the embolized arteries was noted on follow-up angiography in three animals (60%), respectively. Conclusion BAE with PVA particles can transiently suppress ghrelin levels in embolized animals, but levels are not significantly different compared to controls. Stomach ulcerations were identified in 60% of the embolized animals.",121
"The design problem of a static output feedback controller and multivariable proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is investigated for linear time-invariant systems (LTI). First, the static output feedback stabilization problem is taken into consideration and then an iterative linear matrix inequality (ILMI) algorithm is developed for the synthesis of the controller. Second, choosing a multivariable PID control law, the whole system is transformed into a new augmented system represented in the form of a static output feedback control system. This method allows us to convert the multivariable PID controller design problem into a static output feedback synthesis problem. Thus, the proposed ILMI algorithm can as well be utilized for the design of the multivariable PID controller. Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate a practical application of the developed methodologies.",59
"The transition from casual to compulsive drug use is thought to occur as a consequence of repeated drug taking leading to neuroadaptive changes in brain circuitry involved in emotion and cognition. At the basis of such neuroadaptations lie changes in the expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) implicated in transcriptional regulation, synaptic plasticity and intracellular signalling. However, little is known about how IEG expression patterns change during long-term drug self-administration. The present study, therefore, compares the effects of 10 and 60-day self-administration of cocaine and sucrose on the expression of 17 IEGs in brain regions implicated in addictive behaviour, i.e. dorsal striatum, ventral striatum and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Increased expression after cocaine self-administration was found for 6 IEGs in dorsal and ventral striatum (c-fos, Mkp1, Fosb/Delta Fosb, Egr2, Egr4, and Arc) and 10 IEGs in mPFC (same 6 IEGs as in striatum, plus Bdnf, Homer1, Sgk1 and Rgs2). Five of these 10 IEGs (Egr2, Fosb/Delta Fosb, Bdnf, Homer1 and Jun) and Trkb in mPFC were responsive to long-term sucrose self-administration. Importantly, no major differences were found between IEG expression patterns after 10 or 60 days of cocaine self-administration, except Fosb/Delta Fosb in dorsal striatum and Egr2 in mPFC, whereas the amount of cocaine obtained per session was comparable for short-term and long-term self-administration. These steady changes in IEG expression are, therefore, associated with stable self-administration behaviour rather than the total amount of cocaine consumed. Thus, sustained impulses to IEG regulation during prolonged cocaine self-administration may evoke neuroplastic changes underlying compulsive drug use.",104

"The suadea salsa full-length S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (SsSAMS2) was introduced into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. The gene transformation and expression in tobacco were confirmed by PCR, RT-PCR and Northern blotting analysis. Several transgenic lines (ST lines) overexpressing SsSAMS2 gene under the control of cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter showed more seeds number and weight, and accumulated higher free total polyamines (PAs) than wild-type plants (WT lines) and transformants with blank vector (BT lines). Salt stress-induced damage was attenuated in these transgenic plants, in the symptom of maintaining higher photosynthetic rate and biomass. These results that the transgenic plants overexpressing suadea salsa SAMS2 are more tolerant to salt stress than wild-type plants suggest that PAs may play an important role in contributing salt tolerance to plants.",38
"There is evidence that when at least one spatial dimension of a material component is in the nanometer range, the effects of nanosize stress concentrators (NSCs) such as impurities, inclusions, pores, and cracks are either eliminated or significantly reduced. The aim of the paper is to examine such evidence using atomistic simulation techniques for a crystalline metal and identify the critical dimensions below which the effects of NSCs are minimal or even nonexistent. The preliminary results reported herein show that for Cu single crystals subjected to constant external strain rate, such critical dimensions are larger than about 30 rim. Since atomistic details are crucial in understanding material behavior at such scales, the paper points to the need for multiscale simulations techniques, presently being developed, for identifying critical dimensions and for examining slow strain rates. Based on the results, the paper presents simulation-based explanations why NSCs may be insignificant at nanoscales. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",91
"The purpose of this study is to present the computational method applicable for stability analyses of structures. In this paper, a typical complex eigenproblem for a monodromy matrix is solved in order to perform the stability analysis of vehicle streams moving along the bridge. The inertia forces of vehicles and the springing of vehicles are taken into account. Unstable structure vibrations were detected. The instability is a combination parametric resonance one. The combination parametric resonance is not a typical one as it involves the interaction of not two or three but numerous modal forms simultaneously. (C) The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",97
"This paper presents the results of an investigation into the effect of decrease in drainage capacity by hydraulic deterioration of tunnel geosynthetic drainage systems on the structural performance of tunnel linings. The use of geosynthetics in tunnel construction is first introduced together with a summary of geotextile filter design principles and practices. A series of stress-pore-pressure-coupled finite-element (FE) analyses were then carried out on a number of tunnel cases in order to investigate the effect of hydraulic deterioration of the tunnel drainage layer on the structural performance of tunnel linings. It is shown that the decrease in drainage capacity of the drainage layer significantly increases the axial thrust and bending moment of the tunnel lining, with more pronounced increases in the bending moment. It is also revealed that hydraulic deterioration-induced lining forces tend to increase with the hydraulic head and slightly decrease with the cover depth. It is also shown that the progressive development of hydraulic deterioration-induced lining forces can be best fit with an exponential function which can be used to predict the lining force increase for a given tunnel condition. Practical implications of the findings are discussed.",93
"Objective To measure impact of pediatricians' perceived self-efficacy and confidence on current practices and attitudes regarding four violence prevention (VP) topics (gun storage, gun removal, limiting exposure to media violence, discipline techniques) during health supervision for children ages 2 - 11. Methods Random sample survey of American Academy of Pediatrics Fellows (n = 486; 53% response rate) providing health supervision for children ages 2 - 11. Participants surveyed about VP issues regarding: (1) current counseling practices for 2 - 5 and 6 - 11 year olds; (2) amount of time spent addressing; (3) confidence in addressing; and (4) perceived self-efficacy at changing patients' behaviors. Multivariate analyses explored relationships between pediatricians' perceived self-efficacy and confidence versus VP counseling frequency. Results VP topics were not routinely discussed during health supervision. Most pediatricians (64%) reported spending too little time addressing these topics. Although most pediatricians felt confident discussing and effective at changing behaviors regarding limiting exposure to media violence (89% vs. 50%) and discipline techniques (91% vs. 76%), they were less so for safe gun storage (54% vs. 35%) and gun removal (51% vs. 17%). Perceived self-efficacy was the mediating factor on self-reported VP counseling frequencies for all topics. Conclusions Pediatricians reported spending insufficient time on VP counseling. Confidence and perceived self-efficacy levels varied by VP topic, but for all topics pediatricians felt more confident discussing than effective at changing behaviors. Since pediatricians' self-efficacy was related to counseling practices, boosting self-efficacy could ultimately improve counseling frequencies. Further research is needed to identify methods to build providers' perceived self-efficacy regarding these VP areas.",74
"In this paper, we address identification of a class of multi-input single-output (MISO) linear time-invariant (LTI) discrete-time systems, where the MISO system is composed of several single-input single-output (SISO) LTI systems and only the sum of the output of each SISO system can be measured. By exciting one SISO system and employing periodic inputs to the remaining SISO systems, we decompose the MISO system into the excited SISO system where its input and output can be calculated from the measured data. As such, the original parameters for each SISO system can be estimated using the well-established identification techniques. The proposed method using periodic inputs is also extended to identification beyond the Nyquist frequency. Both simulation and experimental results on identification of actuators in the dual-stage hard disk drive are carried out to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.",49
"The spatio-temporal variation in black carbon (BC) mass concentration and total aerosol optical properties simulated from regional climate model RegCM Versions 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 are investigated and compared with in situ and remote sensing measurements. Higher BC mass concentrations (>3 mu g m(-3)) are found over the Indo-Gangetic Basin (IGB) in all versions. BC mass in RegCM 4.4 and 4.5 are closer to observations. BC mass estimated from RegCM 4.4 and 4.5 is found to agree within 20% with respect to observation during pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons. The differences in observed and simulated mass are >50% during winter over all locations and during winter and post-monsoon over western India, which suggests the need of improvement in emission inventory over the region, as emissions from the biofuel and crop residue burning in agriculture are very low in the emission inventories. RegCM 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5-simulated aerosol optical depths (AODs) are found to have more than 40% underestimation during winter and the post-monsoon over Kanpur, while 4.3 overestimates AOD during the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons over Kanpur, and during all seasons except winter over Gandhi College. Single scattering albedo (SSA) values range from 0.75 to 0.95 in 4.4 and 4.5. Lower SSA values are found over the IGB where anthropogenic emissions dominate. SSA simulated by RegCM 4.4 and 4.5 are lowered by 2-10% with respect to aerosol robotic network (AERONET)-derived SSA. Moreover, during winter such differences are higher (>10%). The RegCM 4.4 and 4.5-simulated BC mass concentrations are nearer to observations, while for columnar optical properties, RegCM 4.3 is more close to measurement. BC mass is 10-30% closer to observations when model for ozone and related chemical tracers-chemical transport model chemical boundary condition are utilized in addition to CAM + EC-EARTH.",94
"Network structures and human behaviors are considered as two important factors in virus defense currently. However, due to ignorance of network security, normal users usually take simple activities, such as reinstalling computer system, or using the computer recovery system to clear virus. How system recovery influences virus spreading is not taken into consideration currently. In this paper, a new virus propagation model considering the system recovery is proposed first, and then in its steady-state analysis, the virus propagation steady time and steady states are deduced. Experiment results show that models considering system recovery can effectively restrain virus propagation. Furthermore, algorithm with system recovery in BA scale-free network is proposed. Simulation result turns out that target immunization strategy with system recovery works better than traditional ones in BA network.",46
"It is accepted that inflammation plays a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis; the pathogenesis is not clear. B-cell-produced interleukin (IL) 10 is an immune regulatory cytokine that can inhibit immune inflammation. This study tests a hypothesis that a psychological stress hormone, cortisol, suppresses IL-10 expression in peripheral B cells of patients with atherosclerosis. Peripheral blood samples were collected from patients with coronary artery atherosclerosis. B cells were isolated from the blood samples to be analyzed for the expression of IL-10 and micro RNA (miR) 98 by real-time polymerase chain reaction. We observed that the frequency of IL-10(+) B cell was less in patients with atherosclerosis than healthy controls. The serum cortisol levels were higher in the patients than that in healthy controls. Peripheral B-cell frequency was negatively correlated with the serum cortisol levels. Exposure of B cells to cortisol increased the expression of miR-98 in B cells. Cortisol also inhibited the expression of IL-10 in B cells, in which miR-98 played a critical role. Treating B cells from atherosclerosis patients with anti-miR-98 liposomes reversed the ability of expression of IL-10 in the cells. The expression of IL-10 is suppressed in peripheral B cells, which can be up regulated by anti-miR-98 liposomes.",37
"Background: Smoking is a well-known public health problem in women as well as men. In many countries including Iran, there is an increase in tobacco use among women. Exploring the experience of smoking by educated women in order to develop effective tobacco prevention programs in these women is necessary. This study aimed to explore the experiences of smoking among Iranian educated women. Methods: This study used a method of qualitative content analysis with the deep individual, semi-structured interviews on a sample of 14 educated female smokers, selected purposefully. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis with conventional approach while being collected. Results: The data analysis led to 16 subcategories which were divided into four main categories: (1) Personal factors including subcategories of imitation, show-off and independence, inexperience and curiosity, personal interest and desire, improved mood, and social defiance; (2) family factors including smokers in the family, intrafamily conflicts, and family strictures and limitations; (3) social factors including subcategories of effects of work and school environment, gender equality symbols, peer pressure, and acceptance among friends; and (4) negative consequences of smoking including subcategories of a sense of being physically hurt, psychological and emotional stress, and being looked upon in a negative and judgmental manner. Conclusions: The findings of this study showed that smoking among Iranian educated women is a multifactorial problem. Thus, it is necessary to address smoking among educated women in a holistic approach that focuses on different determinants including personal, family, and social factors particularly the gender roles and stereotypes.",77
"Background: Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that results in the widespread loss of select classes of neurons throughout the nervous system. The pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease are Lewy bodies and neurites, of which alpha-synuclein fibrils are the major component. alpha-Synuclein aggregation has been reported in the gut of Parkinson's disease patients, even up to a decade before motor symptoms, and similar observations have been made in animal models of disease. However, unlike the central nervous system, the nature of alpha-synuclein species that form these aggregates and the classes of neurons affected in the gut are unclear. We have previously reported selective expression of alpha-synuclein in cholinergic neurons in the gut (J Comp Neurol. 2013; 521: 657), suggesting they may be particularly vulnerable to degeneration in Parkinson's disease. Methods: In this study, we used immunohistochemistry to detect alpha-synuclein oligomers and fibrils via conformation-specific antibodies after rotenone treatment or prolonged exposure to high [K+] in ex vivo segments of guinea-pig ileum maintained in organotypic culture. Key Results: Rotenone and prolonged raising of [ K+] caused accumulation of - alpha-synuclein fibrils in the axons of cholinergic enteric neurons. This took place in a time- and, in the case of rotenone, concentration-dependent manner. Rotenone also caused selective necrosis, indicated by increased cellular autofluorescence, of cholinergic enteric neurons, labeled by ChAT-immunoreactivity, also in a concentration-dependent manner. Conclusions & Inferences: To our knowledge, this is the first report of rotenone causing selective loss of a neurochemical class in the enteric nervous system. Cholinergic enteric neurons may be particularly susceptible to Lewy pathology and degeneration in Parkinson's disease.",19
"Amino-terminal acetylation is a ubiquitous modification in eukaryotes that is involved in a growing number of biological processes. There are six known eukaryotic amino-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs), which are differentiated from one another on the basis of substrate specificity. To date, two eukaryotic NATs, NatA and NatE, have been structurally characterized, of which NatA will acetylate the a-amino group of a number of nonmethionine amino-terminal residue substrates such as serine; NatE requires a substrate amino-terminal methionine residue for activity. Interestingly, these two NATs use different catalytic strategies to accomplish substrate-specific acetylation. In archaea, where this modification is less prevalent, only one NAT enzyme has been identified. Surprisingly, this enzyme is able to acetylate NatA and NatE substrates and is believed to represent an ancestral NAT variant from which the eukaryotic NAT machinery evolved. To gain insight into the evolution of NAT enzymes, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of an archaeal NAT from Sulfolobus solfataricus (ssNAT). Through the use of mutagenesis and kinetic analysis, we show that the active site of ssNAT represents a hybrid of the NatA and NatE active sites, and we highlight features of this protein that allow it to facilitate catalysis of distinct substrates through different catalytic strategies, which is a unique characteristic of this enzyme. Taken together, the structural and biochemical data presented here have implications for the evolution of eukaryotic NAT enzymes and the substrate specificities therein.",36
"Background: The 1-year placebo-controlled (PC) phase of the Glatiramer Acetate Low-Frequency Administration (GALA) study showed that glatiramer acetate 40 mg/mL three times weekly (GA40) significantly reduced annualized relapse rate (ARR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Patients completing the PC phase were invited to an open-label (OL) extension. Objective: To evaluate the effects of early start (ES) and delayed start (DS) of GA40 over 3 years. Methods: A total of 97.2% of patients completing the PC phase received GA40 in the OL extension. ES (n=943) patients received GA40 throughout; DS (n=461) patients received placebo during the PC phase and GA40 during the OL phase. Relapse, MRI, disease progression, and safety were evaluated. Results: A total of 1041 patients completed 3 years of follow-up. During the OL phase, ES and DS patients showed comparable ARRs (0.20-0.22) and similar numbers of gadolinium-enhancing T1 (p=0.49) and new or enlarging T2 lesions (p=0.51) at Year 3. ES patients showed significantly smaller changes in gray matter volume than DS patients from Months 12 to 36 (mean difference, 0.371%; p=0.015), with similar trend in whole-brain volume (p=0.080). Adverse events were mild, consistent with the well-established glatiramer acetate (GA) safety profile. Conclusion: GA40 conferred treatment benefit over 3 years: sustained low ARR and lesion activity and favorable safety.",11
"We consider the problems of computing the maximal and the minimal non-empty suffixes of substrings of a longer text of length n. For the minimal suffix problem we show that for every tau, 1 <= tau <= logn, there exists a linear-space data structure with O(tau) query time and O(n logn/tau) preprocessing time. As a sample application, we show that this data structure can be used to compute the Lyndon decomposition of any substring of the text in O(k tau) time, where k is the number of distinct factors in the decomposition. For the maximal suffix problem, we give a linear-space structure with O(1) query time and O(n) preprocessing time. In other words, we simultaneously achieve both the optimal query time and the optimal construction time. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",41
"Samples of PM2.5 and PM10 have been collected in all of four seasons at seven sites within the city ofJeddah, Saudi Arabia. The samples have been analysed for a range of trace elements. There is a large loading of wind-blown dust and the majority of elements are predominantly associated with coarse particles. Enrichment factors, however, show that some elements are markedly enriched above crustal abundance. Using mean data for the PM2.5 and PM10 fractions from each of the seven sampling sites, health risks have been estimated for particulate matter mass, the elements Cr, Mn, Ni, Pb, As, Cd and V measured in this study, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons using data from an earlier study within Jeddah. Cancer risks are calculated from mean airborne concentrations and cancer slope factors for the carcinogenic metals and PAH, but the cancer risks are relatively modest compared to the lifetime risk of mortality due to PM2.5 exposure. The risks associated with exposure to V and Mn are considered to be small, while concentrations of cadmium far exceed the European Union Limit Value and World Health Organisation guideline. Cadmium shows a very high crustal enrichment factor but is present predominantly in the coarse particle fraction suggesting that local soils and surface dusts are unusually enriched in Cd relative to the global average. Using national data for mortality rates, the excess mortality due to PM2.5 exposure has been calculated and amounts to over 1100 deaths annually for the city of Jeddah. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

"An upsurge of fever cases of unknown origin, but resembling dengue and leptospirosis was reported in Havelock, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, an important tourism spot, during May 2014. Investigations were carried out to determine the aetiology, and to describe the epidemiology of the outbreak. The data on fever cases attending Primary Health Centre (PHC), Havelock showed that the average number of cases reporting per week over the last 2 years was 461 (95% confidence interval 194-729). A total of 27 (435%) patients out of the 62 suspected cases were diagnosed as having DENV infection based on a positive enzyme immunoassay or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The overall attack rate was 94 cases/1000 population and it ranged between 28 and 188/1000 in different villages. The nucleotide sequencing showed that the virus responsible was DENV-3. DENV-3 was first detected in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands in 2013 among wharf workers in Port Blair and within a year it has spread to Havelock Island which is separated from South Andaman by 36 nautical miles.",37
"The lives of two 19th century cousins, both of whom changed their names to Bernard Berenson, are considered from historical and psychodynamic perspectives, using a psychobiographical method. The Jewish cousins immigrated separately to Boston from Lithuania in 1875 and 1882. One cousin, later calling himself simply B.B., became a world-renowned art historian. The other Bernard became a misanthrope after feeling deeply humiliated by his cousin's family in Boston. Many biographies were written about the famous B.B. The only histories of his cousin Bernard were family stories, as he was the author's great-grandfather. The intersecting lives of these cousins are discussed. Both men faced the challenges of immigration as well as intense antiSemitism and prejudice in each country in which they lived. These cultural and historical conditions interacted with the cousins' narcissistic vulnerabilities. Their lives demonstrate different manifestations of narcissistic suffering, with B.B's being more consistent with the construct of a ""grandiose narcissist"" and Bernard's being more consistent with that of a ""closet narcissist."" The life stories of these two cousins with the same name offers an intriguing instance of a complicated relationship among immigration, prejudice, and narcissism and case examples of the manifestation of how narcissistic suffering can influence lives.",61
"Testosterone is thought to be positively associated with ""mating effort"", or the initiation and establishment of sexual relationships (Wingfield et al., 1990). Yet, because testosterone is negatively associated with nurturance (van Anders et al., 2011), high levels of testosterone may be incompatible with relationship maintenance. For instance, partnered men with high testosterone report lower relationship quality compared to partnered men with low testosterone (e.g., Booth and Dabbs, 1993). Findings for women are inconsistent however, and even less is known about potential dyadic associations between testosterone and relationship quality in couples. In the current report we assessed relationship satisfaction, commitment, and investment in heterosexual couples and tested the hypothesis that these aspects of relationship quality would be negatively associated with an individual's own and his/her partner's testosterone levels. We found that testosterone was in fact negatively associated with relationship satisfaction and commitment in both men and women. There was also evidence for dyadic associations: Participants' satisfaction and commitment were negatively related to their partners' levels of testosterone, and these associations were larger for women's than men's testosterone. Our findings are consistent with the idea that high testosterone may be incompatible with the maintenance of nurturant relationships. The current findings also provide some of the first evidence for dyadic associations between testosterone and relationship quality in couples, highlighting the interdependent nature of close relationship processes and the importance of considering this interdependence in social neuroendocrine research.

"Aims: Ancient DNA (aDNA) extracted from historical bones is damaged and fragmented into short segments, present in low quantity, and usually copurified with microbial DNA. A wide range of DNA quantification methods are available. The aim of this study was to compare the five most common DNA quantification methods for aDNA. Materials and Methods: Quantification methods were tested on DNA extracted from skeletal material originating from an early medieval burial site. The tested methods included ultraviolet (UV) absorbance, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) based on SYBR (R) green detection, real-time qPCR based on a forensic kit, quantification via fluorescent dyes bonded to DNA, and fragmentary analysis. Differences between groups were tested using a paired t-test. Results: Methods that measure total DNA present in the sample (NanoDrop (TM) UV spectrophotometer and Qubit (R) fluorometer) showed the highest concentrations. Methods based on real-time qPCR underestimated the quantity of aDNA. The most accurate method of aDNA quantification was fragmentary analysis, which also allows DNA quantification of the desired length and is not affected by PCR inhibitors. Conclusions: Methods based on the quantification of the total amount of DNA in samples are unsuitable for ancient samples as they overestimate the amount of DNA presumably due to the presence of microbial DNA. Real-time qPCR methods give undervalued results due to DNA damage and the presence of PCR inhibitors. DNA quantification methods based on fragment analysis show not only the quantity of DNA but also fragment length.",37
"Despite improved survival due to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), youth with perinatallyacquired HIV (PHIV) show cognitive deficits and developmental delay at increased rates. HIV affects the brain during critical periods of development, and the brain may be a persistent reservoir for HIV due to suboptimal blood brain barrier penetration of cART. We conducted structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and cognitive testing in 40 PHIV youth (mean age = 16.7 years) recruited from the NIH Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS) who are part of the first generation of PHIV youth surviving into adulthood. Historical and current HIV disease severity and substance use measures were also collected. Total and regional cortical grey matter brain volumes were compared to a group of 334 typically developing, HIV-unexposed and uninfected youth (frequency-matched for age and sex) from the Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics (PING) study (mean age = 16.1 years). PHIV youth had smaller (2.8-5.1%) total and regional grey matter volumes than HIV-unexposed and uninfected youth, with smallest volumes seen among PHIV youth with higher past peak viral load (VL) and recent unsuppressed VL. In PHIV youth, worse cognitive performance correlated with smaller volumes. This pattern of smaller grey matter volumes suggests that PHIV infection may influence brain development and underlie cognitive dysfunction seen in this population. Among PHIV youth, smaller volumes were also linked to substance use (alcohol use: 9.0-13.4%; marijuana use: 10.1-16.0%). In this study, collection of substance use information was limited to the PHIV cohort; future studies should also collect substance use information in controls to further address interactions between HIV and substance use on brain volume.

"In a single experiment with 5- and 6-year-old children, we examined whether the changes that children make in response to cross-examination style questioning vary as a function of delay and/or persist in subsequent interviews. Children visited the local police station; 1-3 days later they were interviewed in a direct examination format. Either 1-3 days or 8 months later, children were interviewed in a cross-examination format designed to persuade them to change their original responses. One week following the cross-examination interview, the direct examination questions were repeated. Relative to direct examination scores, the accuracy of children's reports decreased significantly during cross-examination, irrespective of delay. When children were interviewed again 1 week after cross-examination, however, their responses (and their accuracy levels) were very similar to those observed during the direct examination interview. That is, during cross-examination, children made changes to their earlier testimony even when their memory for the event remained intact.",78
"Software fault tolerance is an important issue when using software systems in safety-critical applications. In such systems, software robustness is an essential requirement for improving software fault tolerance. Since an operating system (OS) is a major part of a safety-critical system, its robustness has considerable influence on the system's overall robustness. In recent years, researchers have emphasized the importance of considering the OS state in robustness testing. OS state is determined by analysis of the interactions between OS components. In this paper, an approach, named TIMEOUT, is proposed for robustness testing of embedded real-time OSs. This approach reveals the impact of time delays, i.e. inputs with invalid timing delay, on the OS kernel functionality. TIMEOUT takes the OS state into account and improves the existing robustness testing methods. The proposed approach has been implemented and the experiments have been performed on Linux PREEMPT-RT, which is an embedded real-time implementation of Linux operating system. The results show that OS state can influence the OS behavior with respect to fault tolerance, in the presence of time delays. Based on the results of this approach, system developers can identify criticality of OS states and improve robustness of OS in those states.",68
"Extrafetal tissues are a noncontroversial and inexhaustible source of mesenchymal stem cells that can be harvested noninvasively at low cost. In the veterinary field, as in man, stem cells derived from extrafetal tissues express plasticity, reduced immunogenicity, and have high anti-inflammatory potential making them promising candidates for treatment of many diseases. Umbilical cord mesenchymal cells have been isolated and characterized in different species and have recently been investigated as potential candidates in regenerative medicine. In this study, cells derived from bovine Wharton jelly (WJ) were isolated for the first time by enzymatic methods, frozen/thawed, cultivated for at least 10 passages, and characterized. Wharton jelly-derived cells readily attached to plastic culture dishes displaying typical fibroblast-like morphology and, although their proliferative capacity decreased to the seventh passage, these cells showed a mean doubling time of 34.55 +/- 6.33 hours and a mean frequency of one colony-forming unit fibroblast like for every 221.68 plated cells. The results of molecular biology studies and flow cytometry analyses revealed that WJ-derived cells showed the typical antigen profile of mesenchymal stem cells and were positive for CD29, CD44, CD105, CD166, Oct-4, and c-Myc. They were negative for CD34 and CD14. Remarkably, WJ-derived cells showed differentiation ability. After culture in induced media, WJ-derived cells were able to differentiate into osteogenic, adipogenic, chondrogenic, and neurogenic lines as shown by positive staining and expression of specific markers. On polymerase chain reaction analysis, these cells were negative for MHC-II and positive for MHC-I, thus reinforcing the role of extrafetal tissue as an allogenic source for bovine cell-based therapies. These results provide evidence that bovine WJ-derived cells may have the potential to differentiate to repair damaged tissues and reinforce the importance of extrafetal tissues as stem cell sources in veterinary regenerative medicine. A more detailed evaluation of their immunologic properties is necessary to better understand their potential role in cellular therapy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",30
"In this paper, a (2 + 1)-dimensional nonlinear Schrodinger equation for a (2 + 1)-dimensional Heisenberg ferromagnetic spin chain with the bilinear and anisotropic interactions is investigated. Via the Hirota method and symbolic computation, bilinear forms and multi-soliton solutions are derived. The one, two and three solitons are analyzed graphically and we find the amplitudes and widths of the two and three solitons keep invariant after each interaction. The bell-shape one soliton as well as parallel, crossed two and three solitons are respectively observed. Through the asymptotic analysis, expressions which denote the two solitons before and after the interactions are obtained and interactions between the two solitons are proved to be elastic.

"Background: Selenium is an essential element, but its metabolism in humans is not well characterized. A few small studies indicate that the trimethylselenonium ion (TMSe) is a common selenium metabolite in humans. Objective: This study aimed to elucidate the human metabolism of selenium to TMSe. Design: Study individuals constituted subsamples of 2 cohorts: 1) pregnant women (n = 228) and their 5-y-old children (n = 205) in rural Bangladesh with poor selenium status [median urinary selenium (U-Se): 6.4 mu g/L in mothers, 14 mu g/L in children] and 2) women in the Argentinian Andes (n = 83) with adequate selenium status (median U-Se: 24 mu g/L). Total U-Se and blood selenium were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS), and urinary concentrations of TMSe were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography/vapor generation/ICPMS. A genomewide association study (GWAS) was performed for 1,629,299 (after filtration) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Bangladeshi women (n = 72) by using Illumina Omni5M, and results were validated by using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: TMSe ""producers"" were prevalent (approximately one-third) among the Bangladeshi women and their children, in whom TMSe constituted similar to 10-70% of U-Se, whereas ""nonproducers"" had, on average, 0.59% TMSe. The TMSe-producing women had, on average, 2-mu g U-Se/L higher concentrations than did the nonproducers. In contrast, only 3 of the 83 Andean women were TMSe producers (6-15% TMSe in the urine); the average percentage among the nonproducers was 0.35%. Comparison of the percentage of urinary TMSe in mothers and children indicated a strong genetic influence. The GWAS identified 3 SNPs in the indolethylamine N-methyltransferase gene (INMT) that were strongly associated with percentage of TMSe (P < 0.001, false-discovery rate corrected) in both cohorts. Conclusions: There are remarkable population and individual variations in the formation of TMSe, which could largely be explained by SNPs in INMT. The TMSe-producing women had higher U-Se concentrations than did nonproducers, but further elucidation of the metabolic pathways of selenium is essential for the understanding of its role in human health.",32
"The current Internet is facing unprecedented demands, and the challenges and protocols were designed and incorporated into the system as a patchwork for solving many issues. The patchwork approach of non-integrated security mechanisms does not appropriately address the problems, because the problem lies with the architecture itself and not of protocols. Flexible network architecture is being explored as a new approach to address the issues of technical and non-technical challenges of the present Internet. Many flexible network architectures were designed to address the infrastructural problems of the current Internet. Service-oriented network architecture is one that is based on service-oriented architecture supporting short-term and long-term demands that evolve. It offers various flexible services without considering the threats that are raised due to lack of security in the architecture. The paper discusses the security requirements for the proposed architecture in order to avoid and tolerate the attacks of the network. Security and Communication Networks.

"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) introduced changes in labeling and indications for use to testosterone products in 2015 due to a possible increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) events. This decision was made based on six clinical studies-some that supported an increased CV risk, and some that did not. Since this decision, additional studies have been published examining the interplay between hypogonadism, CV risk, and testosterone, demonstrating that the risk may be lower than originally estimated. Clinicians are placed in a difficult position, as studies support an increased mortality risk in hypogonadal men, but also an increased risk of CV events in men on testosterone therapy. As a result, many clinicians will be more selective in their prescribing of testosterone. In this review, we examine how these new guidelines arose and how they may affect prescribing habits.",6
"this paper presents a column-level 14-bit two-stage analog-to-digital converter (ADC) based on pseudo-differential operational amplifier, which is designed for the readout circuit of X-ray sensor array. This low-power hybrid ADC employs an incremental sigma-delta ADC and a cyclic ADC, achieving a good trade-off between accuracy and conversion speed. The two stages share the same analog circuit to reduce area and power consumption. A test chip is fabricated in 0.18 mu m CMOS technology. The hybrid ADC in each column is performed in parallel with power consumption of 218.813 mu W. The simulation result reveals the effective number of bits (ENOB) is 13.775 bits.",60
"Legislation and fiscal policies have remained the key drivers of construction waste minimization. It has often been suggested that reducing waste to the landfill does not only require improvement on existing waste management policies and fiscal framework; there is a need for adequate inputs from the construction professionals. As a means of engendering effective waste management policies, this study explores industry practitioners' viewpoints on effective policies for minimising waste landfilled by the UK construction industry. Using exploratory sequential mixed method approach, qualitative and quantitative methods were used. In the first phase of the study, data was collected through focus group discussions with 24 experts from the UK construction industry. Findings from the qualitative study served as an input into a questionnaire, which was used to elicit a wider opinion from 63 experts at the quantitative stage of the study. The study suggests that for waste management legislation and policies to effectively drive construction waste minimization, six key measures are important. These include (i) provision of tax breaks and incentives to good waste performers and waste management businesses; (ii) increased targeting of design stages in policies; (iii) Extension of sustainable design appraisal systems by allocating more points to proven waste performance measures; (iv) increased stringency of legislative measures by requiring use of proven waste efficient design, procureMent and construction methods; (v) increased stringency of fiscal policies by increasing penalties for poor waste performance; and (vi) corroboration of policy requirements with enablers and facilitators. The strategies through which each of the legislative and fiscal measures could be tailored and enhanced are discussed in the paper. By embracing both Stringent and palliative policy measures suggested in the study, substantial construction waste could be diverted from landfill. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",102
"Introduction: Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (Ph-MPN) are characterized by overproduction of one or more blood cell lines. Methods: We studied the proliferative characteristics of 91 patients with de novo Ph-MPN. Colony-forming cells (CFC) and endogenous colonies (EC), from bone marrow (BM) and/or peripheral blood (PB), were analyzed by colony assay based on methylcellulose. The level of circulating CD34(+) cells was determined by flow cytometry. Results: The total number of PB CFC in primary myelofibrosis (PMF) was increased compared to the control sample (P < 0.01) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) (P < 0.05). The highest number of BM and PB EC was observed in polycythemia vera (PV) (P < 0.01). Increased levels of CD34(+) cells characterized early-prefibrotic (57%) and advanced-fibrotic PMF (90%) as compared to PV (34%) and ET (32%) (P < 0.01). In the whole Ph-MPN group, the total number of PB CFC (P < 0.01), PB EC (P < 0.05), and CD34+ cells (P < 0.01) correlated with the degree of BM fibrosis. Higher levels of circulating CD34(+) cells in PMF correlated with the total number of PB EC (P < 0.05) and degree of BM fibrosis (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Exploration of the PB proliferative characteristics of Ph-MPN on diagnosis may be helpful in revealing early-prefibrotic PMF. Monitoring the levels of circulating CD34(+) cells may provide a sensitive indicator of fibrotic evolution in PV and PMF.",12
"Recently, deep learning processors have become one of the most promising solutions of accelerating deep learning algorithms. Currently, the only method of programming the deep learning processors is through writing assembly instructions by bare hands, which costs a lot of programming efforts and causes very low efficiency. One solution is to integrate the deep learning processors as a new back-end into one prevalent high-level deep learning framework (e.g., TPU (tensor processing unit) is integrated into Tensorflow directly). However, this will obstruct other frameworks to profit from the programming interface. The alternative approach is to design a framework-independent low-level library for deep learning processors (e.g., the deep learning library for GPU, cuDNN). In this fashion, the library could be conveniently invoked in high-level programming frameworks and provides more generality. In order to allow more deep learning frameworks to gain benefits from this environment, we envision it as a low-level library which could be easily embedded into current high-level frameworks and provide high performance. Three major issues of designing such a library are discussed. The first one is the design of data structures. Data structures should be as few as possible while being able to support all possible operations. This will allow us to optimize the data structures easier without compromising the generality. The second one is the selection of operations, which should provide a rather wide range of operations to support various types of networks with high efficiency. The third is the design of the API, which should provide a flexible and user-friendly programming model and should be easy to be embedded into existing deep learning frameworks. Considering all the above issues, we propose DLPlib, a tensor-filter based library designed specific for deep learning processors. It contains two major data structures, tensor and filter, and a set of operators including basic neural network primitives and matrix/vector operations. It provides a descriptor-based API exposed as a C++ interface. The library achieves a speedup of 0.79x compared with the performance of hand-written assembly instructions.",41
"This paper presents an approach to measure, characterize and simulate photometric performances of light transmission efficiency of an innovative transparent concrete panel for facades. The transparency was obtained by a texture of PMMA resin insertions in the fiber reinforced concrete panel. In the first part of the paper integrating sphere measurements were collected to derive spectral optical properties of the panel. The optical properties of a specimen were measured for incidence angles between normal and 60 degrees and the spectral results were reported. The data collected during the measures were used to: create and validate a simplified Radiance model of the panel and to optimize simulation parameters to estimate properly the total internal reflections effects thought the PMMA resin insertions.

"Worldwide increase in carbapenem resistance and transferable carbapenemases are significant challenges in treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. In this study, investigation of carbapenemase production in carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates recovered from clinical specimens in a tertiary hospital was aimed. A total of 84 carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates were examined. Carbapenem inactivation method (CIM) was used for phenotypic detection of carbapenemase production. The existence of bla(KPC), bla(NDM), bla(IMP), bla(VIM), bla(OXA-48), and bla(GES) genes was investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Subtypes of the detected genes were identified by sequence analysis. Arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR) was performed to evaluate the clonal relationship among the isolates. The presence of high-risk clones in carbapenemase producers was investigated by Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionizationtime of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Three isolates (3.5%) were identified as carbapenemase producers by CIM tests, while PCR tests demonstrated three isolates carrying carbapenemase genes as well. bla(VIM) gene was found in two isolates and bla(GES) gene was found in one isolate. Sequence analysis demonstrated that the carbapenemases were VIM-1, VIM-2, and GES-5. AP-PCR yielded high clonal diversity among the isolates. According to MALDI-TOF MS analysis, none of the carbapenemase-producing strains belonged to the high-risk clones. In conclusion, the presence of VIM-1, VIM-2, and GES-5 type carbapenemases in P. aeruginosa isolates was demonstrated for the first time in our hospital, GES-5 being reported for the second time in Turkey. Our results will lead strategies for controlling the spread of carbapenemases and contribute to epidemiological data from Turkey.",37
"Ask any neuroscientist to name the most profound discoveries in the field in the past 60years, and at or near the top of the list will be a phenomenon or technique related to genes and their expression. Indeed, our understanding of genetics and gene regulation has ushered in whole new systems of knowledge and new empirical approaches, many of which could not have even been imagined prior to the molecular biology boon of recent decades. Neurochemistry, in the classic sense, intersects with these concepts in the manifestation of neuropeptides, obviously dependent upon the central dogma (the established rules by which DNA sequence is eventually converted into protein primary structure) not only for their conformation but also for their levels and locales of expression. But, expanding these considerations to non-peptide neurotransmitters illustrates how gene regulatory events impact neurochemistry in a much broader sense, extending beyond the neurochemicals that translate electrical signals into chemical ones in the synapse, to also include every aspect of neural development, structure, function, and pathology. From the beginning, the mutability - yet relative stability - of genes and their expression patterns were recognized as potential substrates for some of the most intriguing phenomena in neurobiology - those instances of plasticity required for learning and memory. Near-heretical speculation was offered in the idea that perhaps the very sequence of the genome was altered to encode memories. A fascinating component of the intervening progress includes evidence that the central dogma is not nearly as rigid and consistent as we once thought. And this mutability extends to the potential to manipulate that code for both experimental and clinical purposes.",30
"A probabilistic relational database is a probability distribution over a set of deterministic relational databases (namely, possible worlds). Efficient updating information in probabilistic databases is required in several applications, such as sensor networking and data cleaning. As a way to update a probabilistic database, conditioning refines the probability distribution of the possible worlds based on general knowledge, such as functional dependencies. The existing methods for conditioning are exponential over the number of variables in the probabilistic database for an arbitrary constraint. In this paper, a constraint-based conditioning framework is proposed, which solves the conditioning problem by considering only the variables in the given constraint. Then, we prove the correctness of our proposed approach and provide efficient algorithms for each step of the approach. Afterward, a pruning strategy that can significantly improve the efficiency of the constraint-based approach is proposed for the functional dependency constraints. Furthermore, for functional dependency constraints, a variable-elimination strategy that minimizes the number of generated variables can benefit the subsequent query processing. The experimental study shows that the constraint based approach is more efficient than other approaches described in the literature. The effectiveness of the two optimization strategies for functional dependency constraints is also demonstrated in the experiment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",112
"The Philadelphia negative myeloproliferative neoplasms include polycythaemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytopenia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Patients with these conditions were mainly thought to harbour JAK2V617F mutations or an Myeloproliferative leukaemia (MPL) substitution. In 2013, two revolutionary studies identified recurrent mutations in a gene that encodes the protein calreticulin (CALR). This mutation was detected in patients with PMF and ET with non-mutated JAK2 or MPL but was absent in patients with PV. The CALR gene encodes the calreticulin protein, which is a multifactorial protein, mainly located in the endoplasmic reticulum in chromosome 19 and regulates calcium homeostasis, chaperones and has also been implicated in multiple cellular processes including cell signalling, regulation of gene expression, cell adhesion, autoimmunity and apoptosis. Somatic 52 bp deletions and recurrent 52 bp insertion mutations in CALR were detected and all resulted in frameshift and clusters in exon 9 of the gene. This review will summarise the current knowledge on the CALR gene and mutation of the gene in pathological conditions and patient phenotypes.",12
"Background: Reduced bone formation is associated with increased bone marrow fat in many bone-loss related diseases including aging, post-menopause, and anorexia nervosa. Several lines of evidence suggested the regulation of osteogenesis and adipogenesis of the bone marrow-derived mesenchymal (skeletal) stem cells (BMSCs) by paracrine mediators. This study aimed to investigate the impact of adipocytes-secreted factors on the cell proliferation and osteoblast differentiation of BMSCs. Methods: Serum free conditioned medium (CM-Adipo) was collected from stromal ST2 cells-derived adipocytes. Cell viability, quantitative alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay, Alizarin red staining for matrix mineralization and osteogenic gene array expression were performed to determine the effect of CM-Adipo on cell proliferation and osteoblast differentiation of primary murine BMSCs (mBMSCs). Regulation of BMPs and NF-kappa B signaling pathways by CM-Adipo were detected by Western blot analysis and gene reporter assay. Results: CM-Adipo showed no effect on cell viability/proliferation of primary mBMSCs as compared to CM-control. On the other hand, CM-Adipo significantly inhibited the commitment of mBMSCs into osteoblastic cell lineage in dose-dependent manner. CM-Adipo was found to dramatically inhibit the BMP2-induced osteoblast differentiation and to activate the inflammatory NF-kappa B signaling in mBMSCs. Interestingly, treatment of mBMSCs with the selective inhibitor of NF-kappa B pathway, BAY11-770682, showed to retrieve the inhibitory effect of CM-Adipo on BMP2-induced osteoblast differentiation in mBMSCs. Conclusions: Our data demonstrated that the marrow adipocytes exert paracrine inhibitory effect on the osteoblast differentiation of mBMSCs by blocking BMPs signaling in a mechanism mediated by adipokines-induced NF-kappa B pathway activation.",9
"Objective: An abundance of experimental studies have motivated a range of models concerning the cognitive underpinnings of severe mental disorders, yet the conception that cognitive and brain dysfunction is confined to specific cognitive domains and contexts has limited ecological validity. Schizophrenia and bipolar spectrum disorders have been conceptualized as disorders of brain connectivity; yet little is known about the pervasiveness across cognitive tasks. Methods: To address this outstanding issue of context specificity, we estimated functional network connectivity from fMRI data obtained during five cognitive tasks (0-back, 2-back, go/no-go, recognition of positive faces, negative faces) in 90 patients with schizophrenia spectrum, 97 patients with bipolar spectrum disorder, and 136 healthy controls, including 1615 fMRI datasets in total. We tested for main effects of task and group, and their interactions, and used machine learning to classify task labels and predict cognitive domain scores from brain connectivity. Results: Connectivity profiles were positively correlated across tasks, supporting the existence of a core functional connectivity backbone common to all tasks. However, 76.2% of all network links also showed significant task-related alterations, robust on the single subject level as evidenced by high machine-learning performance when classifying task labels. Independent of such task-specific modulations, 9.5% of all network links showed significant group effects, particularly including sensory (sensorimotor, visual, auditory) and cognitive (frontoparietal, default-mode, dorsal attention) networks. A lack of group by task interactions revealed that the pathophysiological sensitivity remained across tasks. Such pervasiveness across tasks was further supported by significant predictions of cognitive domain scores from the connectivity backbone obtained across tasks. Conclusions: The high accuracies obtained when classifying cognitive tasks support that brain connectivity indices provide sensitive and specific measures of cognitive states. Importantly, we provide evidence that brain network dysfunction in severe mental disorders is not confined to specific cognitive tasks and show that the connectivity backbone common to all tasks is predictive of cognitive domain traits. Such pervasiveness across tasks may support a generalization of pathophysiological models from different domains, thereby reducing their complexity and increasing their ecological validity. Future research incorporating a wider range of cognitive tasks, involving other sensory modalities (auditory, somatosensory, motor) and requirements (learning, perceptual inference, decision making, etc.), is needed to assess if under certain circumstances, context dependent aberrations may evolve. Our results provide further evidence from a large sample that fMRI based functional network connectivity can be used to reveal both, state and trait effects in the connectome.",115
"Purpose: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic eczematous dermatitis that has a high prevalence and diverse clinical features. Although several hypotheses about its multifactorial pathogenesis have been suggested, the cause is not yet fully understood. A better understanding of the clinical features may helpful inelucidating the pathogenesis of AD. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed the questionnaires, medical charts, and laboratory examination results of 5,000 patients diagnosed with AD at a.single tertiary hospital in Korea. Results: The demographics, allergic comorbidities, family history, severity, and treatment experiences of the patients were analyzed. Most of the patients were adults, 76.3% of whom were classified as havingan extrinsic type of AD. The mean eczema area and severity index (EASI) score was found to be 13.68, and adult patients were found to have higher severity than the other age groups. The anatomical involvements were different among the age groups, with more involvements of the head and neck in adults. The patients reported seasonal changes and stress as the factors that aggravated their symptoms the most. Topical steroids and oral cyclosporine were the most used medications at our clinic, whereas 10.1% of the patients underwent allergen -specific immunotherapy. Conclusions: This analysis of 5,000 patients would lead to a better understanding of various subtypes and diverse clinical features of AD in Koreans. Distinct characteristics were observed among different age groups; thus, treatment strategies may need to be differentiated accordingly.",110
"The integration of drive components is becoming increasingly desirable in global industrial applications. End users want the ability to control the speed of their drivetrain while ensuring that their drive components operate at a high level of reliability and safety. When an electric motor and a variable frequency drive are designed to operate harmoniously, there is an opportunity to optimize cost and reliability of a drivetrain package. This paper provides examples of the improvements in drivetrain component size and cost when motors and drives are sized together as one package, as opposed to having them sized separately without consideration of each other. This paper also provides examples of how cost of ownership due to efficiency improvements can be enhanced when taking into account the entire drivetrain package. Finally, the application considerations required to ensure drivetrain reliability over the life of the installation are discussed.",53
"Type I diabetes mellitus is the most common endocrinologic disorder affecting pediatric patients. Diet regimen adaptations in patients with diabetes may result in focusing on only diet and weight control, which causes eating disorders more often in these patients.

It is well observed that diet management and insulin treatment are withheld for body appearence and social acceptance issues, especially in patients whose disease is diagnosed during adolescence. We hereby present a patient who was diagnosed as having diabetes at the age of 12 years and skipped insulin doses in order to control weight and was subsequently diagnosed as having diabulimia.",67
"The need to store and query a set of strings - a string dictionary - arises in many kinds of applications. While classically these string dictionaries have accounted for a small share of the total space budget (e.g., in Natural Language Processing or when indexing text collections), recent applications in Web engines, Semantic Web (RDF) graphs, Bioinformatics, and many others handle very large string dictionaries, whose size is a significant fraction of the whole data. In these cases, string dictionary management is a scalability issue by itself. This paper focuses on the problem of managing large static string dictionaries in compressed main memory space. We revisit classical solutions for string dictionaries like hashing, tries, and front-coding, and improve them by using compression techniques. We also introduce some novel string dictionary representations built on top of recent advances in succinct data structures and full-text indexes. All these structures are empirically compared on a heterogeneous testbed formed by real-world string dictionaries. We show that the compressed representations may use as little as 5% of the original dictionary size, while supporting lookup operations within a few microseconds. These numbers outperform the state-of-the-art space/time tradeoffs in many cases. Furthermore, we enhance some representations to provide prefix- and substring-based searches, which also perform competitively. The results show that compressed string dictionaries are a useful building block for various data-intensive applications in different domains. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",41
"An anomalously slight glacier mass gain during 2000 to the 2010s has recently been reported in the Karakoram region. However, to date, no investigations of the region-wide glacier mass balance in the Karakoram prior to 2000 have been reported, leaving a knowledge gap for assessing glacier responses to climate change. We calculated elevation and mass change using DEMs generated from KH-9 images acquired during 1973-1980 and the 1 arc-second SRTM DEM. We find a slight mass loss of -0.09 +/- 0.03 m w.e. a(-1) (12 366 km(2)) for 1973-2000, which is less negative than the global average rate for 19712009 (-0.31 +/- 0.19 m w.e. a(-1)). Within the Karakoram, the glacier change patterns are spatially and temporally heterogeneous. In particular, a nearly stable state in the central Karakoram (-0.04 +/- 0.05 m w.e. a(-1) during the period 1974-2000) implies that the Karakoram anomaly dates back to the 1970s. Combined with the previous studies, we conclude that the Karakoram glaciers as a whole were in a nearly balanced state during the 1970s to the 2010s.",94
"Aims and objectives. To explore hospice, acute care and nursing home nurses' experiences of pain management for people with advanced dementia in the final month of life. To identify the challenges, facilitators and practice areas requiring further support. Background. Pain management in end-stage dementia is a fundamental aspect of end-of-life care; however, it is unclear what challenges and facilitators nurses experience in practice, whether these differ across care settings, and whether training needs to be tailored to the context of care. Design. A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis to examine data. Methods. Twenty-four registered nurses caring for people dying with advanced dementia were recruited from 10 nursing homes, three hospices and two acute hospitals across a region of the UK. Interviews were conducted between June 2014-September 2015. Results. Three core themes were identified: challenges administering analgesia, the nurse-physician relationship, and interactive learning and practice development. Patient-related challenges to pain management were universal across care settings; nurse-and organisation-related barriers differed between settings. A need for interactive learning and practice development, particularly in pharmacology, was identified. Conclusions. Achieving pain management in practice was highly challenging. A number of barriers were identified; however, the manner and extent to which these impacted on nurses differed across hospice, nursing home and acute care settings. Needs-based training to support and promote practice development in pain management in end-stage dementia is required. Relevance to clinical practice. Nurses considered pain management fundamental to end-of-life care provision; however, nurses working in acute care and nursing home settings may be undersupported and under-resourced to adequately manage pain in people dying with advanced dementia. Nurse-to-nurse mentoring and ongoing needs-assessed interactive case-based learning could help promote practice development in this area. Nurses require continuing professional development in pharmacology.",119
"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has become one of the most popular bariatric surgeries worldwide, given good result concerning weight loss and long-term morbidity. While surgical technique is well standardized, specimen extraction is still a matter of controversy between surgeons. In this video, we present a simple, fast, safe, and reproducible technique of specimen extraction after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. After the sleeve gastrectomy is completed with hemostasis, the specimen is introduced in a retrieval bag. Stomach specimen orientation is very important, such as the largest specimen part is removed firstly. The 2 cm of the held fundus is introduced under direct vision in the 12-mm trocar. Traction is applied to simultaneously remove the trocar, the cord of the bag, and the grasper. The stomach is held by a Kocher once it is outside the peritoneal cavity. The bag is opened and everted to protect the wound. The pneumoperitoneum is deflated to relax the abdominal wall. The specimen is removed from the abdominal cavity by traction hand-over-hand grasping with gauze. We have applied this technique in 200 consecutive patients with an average body mass index of 42.5. At the first postoperative visit (1 month), none of the patients experienced wound infection. Clinical incisional hernia was detected in one patient (0.5%). This hand-over-hand grasping with gauze technique is simple, safe, reproducible, and time saving.",121
"Background: Small non-coding RNAs are essential regulators of gene expression at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. High-throughput sequencing has revealed thousands of predicted small RNAs; however, only a few of these have been well characterized. Northern blotting is the most convincing method for small RNA validation. Findings: In this study, we improved the Northern blot method by using biotin-labeled probes. miRNAs and siRNAs derived from both Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa were investigated. The results suggest that this improved method is sensitive and efficient, with approximately 5 mu g of total RNA being sufficient for detection. Furthermore, long-term storage of probes labeled in this manner is more convenient, less contaminative and degradative compared with traditional probes. Conclusions: This protocol is an alternative strategy for small RNA detection and represents an efficient means of researching small RNAs.",38
"Computer aided process planning (CAPP) is an important bridge between computer aided design (CAD) and computer aided manufacturing (CAM) in computer integrated manufacturing environment. Operation sequence generation is one of the most difficult tasks in CAPP. The aim of operation sequencing in CAPP is to determine the best order of machining operations with minimal manufacturing cost while satisfying all the precedence constraints. This paper presents a proposed method for optimizing operation sequence using modified clustering algorithm. The key concept of method is that the precedence constraints are firstly checked for selecting all possible next operations of the last operation in the sequence and their traveling costs are compared to choose the optimal feasible operation which has the minimum traveling cost in the sequence. Then, all operation sequences are calculated the total traveling cost for obtaining the optimal sequence result. Because of removing all unfeasible sequences at the beginning of procedure and selecting the optimal operation into sequence in each step, the time can be significantly reduced. The capability and performance of the proposed method are demonstrated in three specific case studies. The comparisons show that the proposed method can solve the problem in much lesser computational time while generating more alternate optimal feasible sequences than previous algorithms.",82
"Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) as an autoimmune disorder is a common disease occurring in central nervous system (CNS) and the remyelination plays a pivotal role in the alleviating neurological impairment in the MS. Catalpol, an effective component extracted from the Chinese herb Radix Rehmanniae, which has been proved protective in cerebral diseases. Methods: To determine the protective effects and mechanisms of Catalpol on MS, the mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) were induced by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)(35-55), as a model for human MS. Th17 cells were counted by flow cytometric (FCM). The expressions of nerve-glial antigen (NG) 2 and myelin basic protein (MBP) were measured by immunohistochemical staining. Olig1+ and Olig2+/BrdU+ cells were counted by immunofluorescence. Olig1 and Olig2 gene expressions were detected by real-time fluorescent quantitative reverse transcription (qRT) - PCR. Results: The results showed that Catalpol improved neurological function, reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and demyelination. It could decrease Th17 cells in the peripheral blood. It increased the protein expressions of NG2 and MBP in mice brains, up-regulated markedly protein and gene expressions of Olig1 and Olig2 in terms of timing, site and targets. Conclusions: These data demonstrated that Catalpol had a strong neuroprotective effect on EAE mice. Catalpol also plays a role in remyelination by promoting the expressions of Olig1 and Olig2 transcription factors.",11
"A new image analysis algorithm based on mathematical morphology and pixel classification for grapevine berry counting is presented in this paper. First, a set of berry candidates represented by connected components was extracted. Then, six descriptors were calculated using key features of these components, and were employed for false positive (FP) discrimination using a supervised approach. More specifically, the set of descriptors modelled the grapes' distinctive shape, light reflection pattern and colour. Two classifiers were tested, a three-layer neural network and an optimised support vector machine. A dataset of 152 images was acquired with a low-cost smart phone camera. Images came from seven grapevine varieties, 18 per variety, at the two phenological stages in the Baggiolini scale between berry set (named stage K; 94 images) and cluster-closure (named stage L; 32 images). 126 of these images were kept for external validation and the remaining 26 were used for training (12 at stage L and 14 at K). From these training images, 5438 true/false positive samples were generated and labelled in terms of the six descriptors. The neural network performed better than the support vector machine, yielding consistent Recall and Precision average values of 0.9572 and 0.8705, respectively. The presented algorithm, implemented as a smartphone application, can constitute a useful diagnosis tool for the in-the-field and non-destructive yield prediction and berry set assessing for the grape and wine industry.

"Many clinical and molecular features of the fragile X syndrome, a common form of intellectual disability and autism, can be modeled by deletion of the Fmr1 protein (Fmrp) in mice. Previous studies showed a decreased expression of several components of the GABAergic system in Fmr1 knockout mice. Here, we used this mouse model to investigate the functional consequences of Fmrp deletion on hippocampal GABAergic inhibition in the CA1-region of the hippocampus. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings demonstrated a significantly reduced amplitude of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) and a decrease in the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous IPSCs. In addition, miniature IPSCs were reduced in amplitude and frequency and decayed significantly slower than mIPSCs in controls. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed a significantly lower expression of alpha 2, beta 1 and delta GABA(A) receptor subunits in the hippocampus of the juvenile mice (P22) compared to wild-type littermates. Correspondingly, we found also at the protein level reduced amounts of alpha 2, beta 1 and delta subunits in Fmr1 knockout mice. Overall, these results demonstrate that the reduction in several components of the GABAergic system is already present at young age and that this reduction results in measurable abnormalities on GABAA receptor mediated phasic inhibition. These abnormalities might contribute to the behavioral and cognitive deficits of this fragile X mouse model. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",113
"In this paper, a Supervised Adaptive Learning-based Fuzzy Controller (ALFC) with Neural Network Identification and Convex Parameterization is designed to identify and control the unmanned vehicle in an autonomous parking system. The objective is to achieve robust learning and control while maintaining a low implementation cost. The proposed algorithm design incorporates the following learning and control theorems -non-linear system identification using neural network, fuzzy logic, supervised adaptive learning as well as multiple model based convex parameterization. To demonstrate the algorithm in a more straight forward manner, we are using a real nonlinear unmanned autonomous driving system as an example to apply the algorithm and showing the superior performance of controller. In the autonomous driving system, the proposed method can be used for both estimating and further controlling a desired vehicle speed and steering wheel turning. With a supervised adaptive learning-based method, robustness can be also assured under various operating environments regardless of unpredictable disturbances. The convex parameterization further improves the speed of convergence of the adaptive learning process for the Fuzzy controller by using the multiple models concept. Last but not least, comparative experiments have also demonstrated that systems equipped with the new algorithm are able to achieve faster and smoother convergence.",35
"This paper compares smart control models for heating supply air among five different climate conditions to discuss the effectiveness of machine learning tools in terms of control and energy efficiency. A thermostat on/off control is typically used to maintain room temperature at a desired level. Advanced computing technologies have recently been introduced to complement the conventional on/off controls to improve control efficiency in heating systems. However, these methods, which were mostly utilized to control fuel amount or fan motor speed, lacked the capability to promptly respond to various outdoor temperature conditions as climate zones requiring refined control strategies to reduce environmental impacts. This paper proposes intelligent controls of mass and temperature simultaneously for heating air supply. The Fuzzy inference System (FIS) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms are utilized to develop six control models, and the models are tested to evaluate both control and energy efficiency during the winter season in five climate zones (from climate zone 2 through 6; i.e., Houston, Dallas, Raleigh, Chicago, and Detroit, respectively). Results include the energy consumption, control errors, and control signals in comparison to the baseline on/off control, which confirms the fact that the ANN simultaneous controls of mass and temperature is more effective than the other controllers for control accuracy and energy savings by 71.3% and 03%, respectively. The effectiveness of the ANN controller can contribute to maintaining room temperature accompanying the reduction of energy consumption, which is directly related to improve human comfort and reduce environmental impacts in various climate zones.

"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a global health concern for which there is no vaccine available. The HCV polymerase is responsible for the critical function of replicating the RNA genome of the virus. Transitions between at least two conformations (open and closed) are necessary to allow the enzyme to replicate RNA. In this study, molecular dynamic simulations were initiated from multiple crystal structures to understand the free energy landscape (FEL) explored by the enzyme as it interconverts between these conformations. Our studies reveal the location of distinct states within the FEL as well as the molecular interactions associated with these states. Specific hydrogen bonds appear to play a key role in modulating conformational transitions. This knowledge is essential to elucidate the role of these conformations in replication and may also be valuable in understanding the basis by which this enzyme is inhibited by small molecules.

"Background and purpose: Few studies have examined why some patients with dementia stop attending medical consultations. We conducted a retrospective study to investigate factors associated with discontinuous clinic attendance. Methods: Participants were 988 patients with dementia from university hospital (UH) clinics and affiliated local hospital (LH) clinics. We compared continuous and discontinuous attenders on cognitive and affective functions and activities of daily living (ADL), and also compared UH and LH patients (UH: continuous, n = 176; discontinuous, n = 207; LH: continuous, n = 418; discontinuous, n = 187). Results: The total annual rate of discontinuation was 8.0%, and the mean period of attendance before discontinuation was 2.2 2.4 years (UH, 2.8 +/- 3.0; LH, 1.5 +/- 1.3, P < 0.01). Scores for the Mini-Mental State Examination, Hasegawa Dementia Scale - Revised, Geriatric Depression Scale, apathy scale, Abe's behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) score, and ADL were significantly worse in the discontinuous group than the continuous group for both UH and LH patients (P < 0.01). The best predictor of discontinuation was ADL decline (UH and LH) and Abe's BPSD score (UH). The most common reason for discontinuation was returning to the family doctor (39.1% for UH), and cessation of hospital attendance at their own discretion (35.3% for LH). Conclusions: We identified the main reasons for discontinuation of attendance as returning to the family doctor and cessation of hospital attendance at their own discretion. The best predictors of discontinuation were ADL decline and worsening BPSD. There were significant differences in discontinuation between UH and LH patients with dementia.",69
"Personal intelligence involves the capacity to reason about personality and personality-related information. Studying ability-based measures of personal intelligence creates a virtuous cycle of better measurement and better theoretical understanding. In Study 1 (N = 10,318), we conduct an item-level analysis of the Test of Personal Intelligence (TOPI) to explore people's problem-solving abilities in the area. Personal intelligence divided into a Consistency-Congruency factor that concerned understanding traits and their associated behaviors, and a Dynamic-Analytic factor that involved understanding personality processes and goals. The finding cross validated in Study 2 (N = 8,459). In Study 3 (N = 384), we examined correlates of the two factors. Understanding the abilities involved in personal intelligence may help us to educate people about how to better solve problems about personality. (C) 2017 ElsevierLtd. All rights reserved.",81
"An integrated low voltage RF receiver for digital satellite radio is presented. It contains all the basic building blocks from the low noise amplifier (LNA) to the baseband buffer and two phase-locked loops (PLL's) which provide the RF and the intermediate frequency (IF) local oscillator signals. Innovative solutions for critical blocks such as the LNA, the IF buffer, the voltage controlled oscillator (VCO), etc., as well as new arrangements for bias circuits have been adopted which greatly increase circuit performance. Moreover, 2.4-V regulated power supplies with power down capability have also been included. The receiver needs a small number of external components that are principally the RF image filter and the surface acoustic ware (SAW) channel filter. It achieves a maximum gain of 120 dB and a noise figure of 5 dB, The internal regulators are set to 2.4 V and ensure correct operation with an external power supply varying from 2.7 to 5.5 V. The receiver was integrated in a highperformance 20-GHz silicon bipolar technology. Its die size is 18 mm(2) and it needs a quiescent current of 75 mA.",54
"None of the proposed mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) fully explains the distribution patterns of the neuropathological changes at the cellular and regional levels, and their clinical correlates. One aspect of this problem lies in the complex genetic, epigenetic, and environmental landscape of AD: early-onset AD is often familial with autosomal dominant inheritance, while the vast majority of AD cases are late-onset, with the epsilon 4 variant of the gene encoding apolipoprotein E (APOE) known to confer a 5-20 fold increased risk with partial penetrance. Mechanisms by which genetic variants and environmental factors influence the development of AD pathological changes, especially neurofibrillary degeneration, are not yet known. Here we review current knowledge of the involvement of the monoaminergic systems in AD. The changes in the serotonergic, noradrenergic, dopaminergic, histaminergic, and melatonergic systems in AD are briefly described. We also summarize the possibilities for monoamine-based treatment in AD. Besides neuropathologic AD criteria that include the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC), special emphasis is given to the serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). Both of these brainstem nuclei are among the first to be affected by tau protein abnormalities in the course of sporadic AD, causing behavioral and cognitive symptoms of variable severity. The possibility that most of the tangle-bearing neurons of the LC and DRN may release amyloid beta as well as soluble monomeric or oligomeric tau protein trans-synaptically by their diffuse projections to the cerebral cortex emphasizes their selective vulnerability and warrants further investigations of the monoaminergic systems in AD.

"One of the challenging issues in a distributed computing system is to reach on a decision with the presence of so many faulty nodes. These faulty nodes may update the wrong information, provide misleading results and may be nodes with the depleted battery power. Consensus algorithms help to reach on a decision even with the faulty nodes. Every correct node decides some values by a consensus algorithm. If all correct nodes propose the same value, then all the nodes decide on that. Every correct node must agree on the same value. Faulty nodes do not reach on the decision that correct nodes agreed on. Binary consensus algorithm and average consensus algorithm are the most widely used consensus algorithm in a distributed system. We apply binary consensus and average consensus algorithm in a distributed sensor network with the presence of some faulty nodes. We evaluate these algorithms for better convergence rate and error rate.",2
"Both network security and quality of service (QoS) consume computational resource of IT system and thus may evidently affect the application services. In the case of limited computational resource, it is important to model the mutual influence between network security and QoS, which can be concurrently optimized in order to provide a better performance under the available computational resource. In this paper, an evaluation model is accordingly presented to describe the mutual influence of network security and QoS, and then a multi-objective genetic algorithm NSGA-II is revised to optimize the multi-objective model. Using the intrinsic information from the target problem, a new crossover approach is designed to further enhance the optimization performance. Simulation results validate that our algorithm can find a set of Pareto-optimal security policies under different network workloads, which can be provided to the potential users as the differentiated security preferences. These obtained Pareto-optimal security policies not only meet the security requirement of the user, but also provide the optimal QoS under the available computational resource. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Background & Aims: All-oral regimens are associated with high cure rates in hepatitis C virus-genotype 1(HCV-GT1) patients. Our aim was to assess the value of cure to the society for treating HCV infection. Methods: Markov model for HCV-GT1 projected long-term health outcomes, life years, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. The model compared second-generation triple (sofosbuvir+pegylated interferon+ribavirin [PR] and simeprevir+PR) and all-oral (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and ombitasvir+paritaprevir/ritonavir+dasabuvir +/- ribavirin) therapies with no treatment. Sustained virological response rates were based on Phase III RCTs. We assumed that 80% and 95% of HCV-GT1 patients were eligible for second-generation triple and all-oral regimens. Transition probabilities, utility and mortality were based on literature review. The value of cure was calculated by the difference in the savings from the economic gains associated with additional QALYs. Results: Model estimated 1.52 million treatment-naive HCV-GT1 patients in the US. Treating all eligible HCV-GT1 patients with second-generation triple and all-oral therapies resulted in 3.2 million and 4.8 million additional QALYs gained compared to no treatment respectively. Using $50,000 as value of QALY, these regimens lead to savings of $185 billion and $299 billion; costs of these regimens were $109 billion and $128 billion. The value of cure with second-generation triple and all-oral regimens was $55 billion and $111 billion, when we conservatively assumed only drug costs. Cost savings were greater for HCV-GT1 patient cured with cirrhosis compared to patients without cirrhosis. Conclusions: The recent evolution of regimens for HCV GT1 has increased efficacy and value of cure.",130
"The increasing prevalence of food allergies and the intake of packing foods in the past two decades urge the need for more rapid, accurate, and sensitive assays to detect potential allergens in food in order to control the allergen content. Most of the commercial analytical tools for allergen detection rely on immunoassays such as ELISA. As far as disadvantages, ELISA can be time-consuming and expensive. Biosensors appear as a suitable alternative for the detection of allergens because they are rapid, highly sensitive, selective, less expensive, environmentally friendly, and easy to handle. In this study, we developed a microfluidic system integrated with a quantum dots (Qdots) aptamer functionalized graphene oxide (GO) nano-biosensor for simple, rapid, and sensitive food allergen detection. The biosensor utilized Qdots-aptamer-GO complexes as probes to undergo conformational change upon interaction with the food allergens, resulting in fluorescence changes due to the fluorescence quenching and recovering properties of GO by adsorption and desorption of aptamer-conjugated Qdots. This one-step 'turn on' homogenous assay in a ready-to-use microfluidic chip took similar to 10 min to achieve a quantitative detection of Ara h 1, one of the major allergens appearing in peanuts. The results suggested this system had remarkable sensitivity and selectivity. The integration of a microfluidics platform in a homemade miniaturized optical analyzer provides a promising way for the rapid, cost-effective, and accurate on-site determination of food allergens. This biosensor can also be extended to the detection of other food allergens with a selection of corresponding aptamers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",105
"In this review paper, the milestones and challenges that have been achieved and experienced by African Environmental Scientists regarding the assessment of water pollution caused by the presence of pharmaceutical compounds in water bodies are highlighted. The identification and quantification of pharmaceuticals in the African water bodies is important to the general public at large due to the lack of information. The consumption of pharmaceuticals to promote human health is usually followed by excretion of these drugs via urine or fecal matter due to their slight transformation in the human metabolism. Therefore, large amounts of pharmaceuticals are being discharged continuously from wastewater treatment plants into African rivers due to inefficiency of employed sewage treatment processes. Large portions of African communities do not even have proper sanitation systems which results in direct contamination of water resources with human waste that contains pharmaceutical constituents among other pollutants. Therefore, this article provides the overview of the recent studies published, mostly from 2012 to 2016, that have focused on the occurrence of different classes of pharmaceuticals in African aqueous systems. Also, the current analytical methods that are being used in Africa for pharmaceutical quantification in environmental waters are highlighted. African Scientists have started to investigate the material's and remediation processes for the elimination of pharmaceuticals from water.(C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",96
"Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters are the oldest and most versatile inorganic cofactors that are required to sustain fundamental life processes. Bacteria have three systems of [Fe-S] cluster biogenesis, designated ISC, NIF, and SUF. In contrast, the Thermus thermophiles HB8 has only one system, formed mostly by SUF homologs that contain six proteins: SufA, SufB, SufC, SufD, SufS and SufE. The kinetics of SufC ATPase was studied using a linked enzyme assay method. In the presence of SufB, SufD or SufBD complexes, the activity of SufC was enhanced. The cysteine desulfurase activity of SufS was also stimulated by the presence of the SufBCD complex. The results obtained through enzymology revealed that aconitase activity was activated by [Fe-S] clusters reconstituted on the SufBCD complex. Consolidated results from spectral and enzymatic analysis suggest that the SufBCD complex is a novel type of Fe-S scaffold system that can assemble Fe/S clusters de novo. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

"The osteoporosis self-assessment tool (OSTA) predicts the risk of osteoporosis in an individual. It is a simple calculation-based tool [wt (kg) - age (yr)/5] and can be used for measuring bone mineral density (BMD). However, OSTA is influenced by ethnicity. We studied the performance of OSTA index as a screening tool for osteoporosis in 257 community-dwelling North Indian men above 50 yr age. Each subject underwent a detailed clinical, dietary, anthropometric, and biochemical assessment and bone density measurement using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. As per World Health Organization criteria, osteoporosis, osteopenia, and normal BMD were observed in 17.9%, 58.8%, and 23.3%, respectively. OSTA index ranged between -6.4 and 8.8. OST index <= 2 predicted osteoporosis with a sensitivity of 95.7% and a specificity of 33.6% and an area under the curve for a receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.702. The OSTA index is an effective screening tool for measuring BMD in elderly Indian men and can be used by primary care physicians.",16
"Background Anderson-Fabry disease is an X-linked defect of glycosphingolipid metabolism. Progressive renal insufficiency is a major source of morbidity, additional complications result from cardio-and cerebro-vascular involvement. Survival is reduced among affected males and symptomatic female carriers. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of enzyme replacement therapy compared to other interventions, placebo or no interventions, for treating Anderson-Fabry disease. Search methods We searched 'Clinical Trials' on The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register (date of the most recent search: 11 September 2012). The original search was performed in September 2008. Date of the most recent search of the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register: 11 September 2012. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials of agalsidase alfa or beta in participants diagnosed with Anderson-Fabry disease. Data collection and analysis Two authors selected relevant trials, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. Main results Six trials comparing either agalsidase alfa or beta in 223 participants fulfilled the selection criteria. Both trials comparing agalsidase alfa to placebo reported on globotriaosylceramide concentration in plasma and tissue; aggregate results were non-significant. One trial reported pain scores, there was a statistically significant improvement for participants receiving treatment at up to three months, mean difference -2.10 (95% confidence interval (CI) -3.79 to -0.41); at up to five months, mean difference -1.90 (95% CI -3.65 to -0.15); and at up to six months, mean difference -2.00 (95% CI -3.66 to -0.34). There was a significant difference in pain-related quality of life at over five months and up to six months, mean difference -2.10 (95% CI -3.92 to -0.28) but not at other time-points. Neither trial reported deaths. One of the three trials comparing agalsidase beta to placebo reported on globotriaosylceramide concentration in plasma and tissue and showed significant improvement: kidney, mean difference -1.70 (95% CI -2.09 to -1.31); heart, mean difference -0.90 (95% CI -1.18 to -0.62); and composite results (renal, cardiac, and cerebrovascular complications and death), mean difference -4.80 (95% CI -5.45 to -4.15). There was no significant difference between groups for death; no trials reported on pain. Only one trial compared agalsidase alfa to agalsidase beta. There was no significant difference between the groups for any adverse events, risk ratio 0.36 (95% CI 0.08 to 1.59), or any serious adverse events; risk ratio 0.30; 95% CI 0.03 to 2.57). Authors' conclusions Six small, poor quality randomised controlled trials provide no robust evidence for use of either agalsidase alfa and beta to treat Anderson-Fabry disease.",36
"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major health concern worldwide as a leading cause of liver-related mortalities and morbidities. Pakistan ranks second among countries with endemic HCV infection; similar to 11 million cases are reported so far. HCV burden is continuously rising in Pakistan, mainly because of unsafe blood transfusions, surgical procedures, dental procedures, untrained clinicians, reuse of syringes, barbers, and ear/nose piercing tools. Lack of awareness about HCV transmission routes among the general and high-risk population is a major hurdle in disease management. HCV prevalence in the general population and healthy blood donors ranges from 3.13% to 23.83% and from 1.05% to 20.8%, respectively; whereas in the high-risk groups, HCV prevalence is up to 66%. Genotype 3 is most prevalent in Pakistan followed by genotypes 1 and 2 along with an alarming number of untypable viral genotypes in the local community. Mainly interferon-based antiviral regimens are used in Pakistan and are quite effective, because the major prevalent genotype (genotype 3) showed the best sustained virological response (SVR) with it. But a large number of individuals did not show SVR either because of infection with nonresponder genotypes or because of side effects. Due to these reasons, there was a need for interferon-free direct acting antivirals (DAAs). Recently, Sovaldi (Sofosbuvir: NS5B inhibitor) is approved on a heavy discounted rate for Pakistan; it is currently in effective use and showed good SVR. Sovaldi plus ribavirin is used alone or along with interferon to treat different viral genotypes. Sovaldi will be the future treatment regime for Pakistan, because genotype 2 and genotype 3 infected individuals achieve the best SVR with it. For the treatment of other prevalent viral genotypes, approval of some other DAAs such as Ledipasvir on discounted price is required for better disease management.",130
"The structure represented by one or several oscillators couple to a one-dimensional transmission environment (e.g. a vibrating string in the mechanical case or a lossless transmission line in the electrical case) turned to be attractive for the research in the field of complex structures and/or complex behavior. This is due to the fact that such a structure represents some generalization of various interconnection modes with lumped parameters for the oscillators. On the other hand the lossless and distortionless propagation along transmission lines has generated several research in electrical, thermal, hydro and control engineering leading to the association of some functional differential equations to the basic initial boundary value problems. The present research is performed at the crossroad of the aforementioned directions. We shall associate to the starting models some functional differential equations - in most cases of neutral type - and make use of the general theorems for existence and stability of forced oscillations for functional differential equations. The challenges introduced by the analyzed problems for the general theory are emphasized, together with the implication of the results for various applications.",55
"Human tauopathies such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), Pick's disease etc., are a group of neurodegenerative diseases which are characterized by abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau that leads to formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Recapitulating several features of human neurodegenerative disorders, the Drosophila tauopathy model displays compromised lifespan, locomotor function impairment, and brain vacuolization in adult brain which is progressive and age dependent. Here, we demonstrate that tissue-specific downregulation of the Drosophila homolog of human c-myc proto-oncogene (dMyc) suppresses tau-mediated morphological and functional deficits by reducing abnormal tau hyperphosphorylation and restoring the heterochromatin loss. Our studies show for the first time that the inherent chromatin remodeling ability of myc proto-oncogenes could be exploited to limit the pathogenesis of human neuronal tauopathies in the Drosophila disease model. Interestingly, recent reports on successful uses of some anti-cancer drugs against Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases in clinical trials and animal models strongly support our findings and proposed possibility.",106
"The International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects, Surveillance and Research reports a rise in the prevalence rate of spina bifida in Japan. We determined first-trimester folate status of Hokkaido women and identified potential predictors. Participants were 15 266 pregnant women of the Hokkaido Study on Environment and Children's Health Cohort. Data were extracted from self-reported questionnaires and biochemical assay results. Demographic determinants of low folate status were younger maternal age (adjusted OR (AOR) 1.48; 95% CI 1.32, 1.66), lower educational level (AOR 1.27; 95% CI 1.17, 1.39) and lower annual income (AOR 1.11; 95% CI 1.01, 1.22). Plasma cotinine concentrations of 1.19-65.21 nmol/l increased the risk of low folate status (AOR 1.20; 95% CI 1.10, 1.31) and concentrations >65.21 nmol/l further increased the risk (AOR 1.91; 95% CI 1.70, 2.14). The most favourable predictor was use of folic acid (FA) supplements (AOR 0.19; 95% CI 0.17, 0.22). Certain socio-demographic factors influence folate status among pregnant Japanese women. Modifiable negative and positive predictors were active and passive tobacco smoking and use of FA supplements. Avoiding both active and passive tobacco smoking and using FA supplements could improve the folate status of Japanese women.",117
"Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4, GKLF) was originally characterized as a zinc finger transcription factor essential for terminal differentiation and cell lineage allocation of several cell types in the mouse. Mice lacking Klf4 die postnatally within hours due to impaired skin barrier function and subsequent dehydration. Recently, KLF4 was also used in cooperation with other transcription factors to reprogram differentiated cells to pluripotent embryonic stem cell-like cells. Moreover, involvement in oncogenesis was also ascribed to KLF4, which is aberrantly expressed in some types of tumors such as breast, gastric and colon cancer. We previously have shown that Klf4 is strongly expressed in postmeiotic germ cells of mouse and human testes suggesting a role for Klf4 also during spermiogenesis. In order to analyze its function we deleted Klf4 in germ cells using the Cre-loxP system. Homologous recombination of the Klf4 locus has been confirmed by genomic southern blotting and the absence of the protein in germ cells was demonstrated by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Despite its important roles in several significant biological settings, deletion of Klf4 in germ cells did not impair spermiogenesis. Histologically, the mutant testes appeared normal and the mice were fertile. In order to identify genes that were regulated by KLF4 in male germ cells we performed microarray analyses using a whole genome array. We identified many genes exhibiting changed expression in mutants even including the telomerase reverse transcriptase mRNA, which is a stem cell marker. However, in summary, the lack of KLF4 alone does not prevent complete spermatogenesis. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",39
"Almost every child in Kurdistan-Iraq is currently growing up as the son or daughter of survivors of collective persecution and genocidal activity carried out during Saddam Hussein's regime. The aim of this study is to communicate first impressions of the second generation's situation and to examine possible effects of transgenerational transmission of unprocessed trauma. Based on fieldwork and interviews with parents who experienced torture and chemical attacks and their adolescent children, strong indications of unprocessed traumatizations were found on the parents' side. They are irritable and show dysfunctional parenting behavior in the form of physical abuse. Indications for boundary blurring and parentification as well as psychological burden - including problems with studying and dysphoric mood - were found among the children. Politicians and professionals in Kurdistan-Iraq need to be aware of possible transmission of parents' traumatic experiences to their children and should provide adequate services.",18
"Numerous studies have shown that exposure to media violence increases aggression, though the mechanisms of this effect have remained elusive. One theory posits that repeated exposure to media violence desensitizes viewers to real world violence, increasing aggression by blunting aversive reactions to violence and removing normal inhibitions against aggression. Theoretically, violence desensitization should be reflected in the amplitude of the P300 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP), which has been associated with activation of the aversive motivational system. In the current study, violent images elicited reduced P300 amplitudes among violent, as compared to nonviolent video game players. Additionally, this reduced brain response predicted increased aggressive behavior in a later task. Moreover, these effects held after controlling for individual differences in trait aggressiveness.

"Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have proven to be a very powerful tool for analyzing data of complex structures. However, their computer-intensive nature, which typically require a large number of iterations and a complete scan of the full dataset for each iteration, precludes their use for big data analysis. In this article, we propose the so-called bootstrap Metropolis-Hastings (BMH) algorithm that provides a general framework for how to tame powerful MCMC methods to be used for big data analysis, that is, to replace the full data log-likelihood by a Monte Carlo average of the log-likelihoods that are calculated in parallel from multiple bootstrap samples. The BMH algorithm possesses an embarrassingly parallel structure and avoids repeated scans of the full dataset in iterations, and is thus feasible for big data problems. Compared to the popular divide-and-combine method, BMH can be generally more efficient as it can asymptotically integrate the whole data information into a single simulation run. The BMH algorithm is very flexible. Like the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, it can serve as a basic building block for developing advanced MCMC algorithms that are feasible for big data problems. This is illustrated in the article by the tempering BMH algorithm, which can be viewed as a combination of parallel tempering and the BMH algorithm. BMH can also be used for model selection and optimization by combining with reversible jump MCMC and simulated annealing, respectively. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.",101
"Aim To investigate the association between the occurrences of developmental defects of enamel (DDE), in first permanent molars, and bronchodilators and/or corticosteroid intake for asthma-like episodic treatment at preschool age, in 6-12 year old children. Methods Children of the case group (n = 70) were followed in the Paediatric Pulmonary Unit and the Unit of Allergology, Asthma and Inflammation at 'Aghia Sofia' Children's Hospital, Athens, Greece and had used asthma drugs during their first 4 years of life. The control group (n = 70) consisted of healthy children who visited the Postgraduate Paediatric Dental Clinic, University of Athens. Information regarding demographic data, medical history, pregnancy, birth weight, duration of breastfeeding, mother's smoking habits and antibiotic use at preschool age was obtained through a structured questionnaire. Details concerning asthma drugs used were extracted from medical records. The children in both groups underwent an oral examination under standard clinical conditions and all surfaces of first permanent molars were assessed for enamel defects using the modified DDE Index. Chi square statistics, Mann-Whitney U test, Spearman correlation coefficient and logistic regression analysis were used for statistical analysis of the data (p <= 0.05). Results DDE were present in 24 children (34.3%) in the case group and only in 6 (8.6%) in the control, with the difference between the two groups being statistically significant (p < 0.001), while the estimated odds ratio was 5.56. Among the children with DDE in the case group, 41.6% had at least one hypoplastic molar with loss of enamel. The type of asthma drug, age at treatment onset and duration of drug use were not significantly associated with the severity or extent of DDE. Among the possible influential factors, gender was the only statistical significant factor. Conclusions Children treated with asthma drugs for asthma-like episodes at a preschool age showed an overall increased risk for developing enamel defects in their first permanent molars. Severe hypoplastic lesions with loss of enamel was a frequent finding among affected molars.",109
"This paper deals with the design and real-time implementation of an Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based reference governor on an industrial-like microcontroller. The task of the governor is to provide optimal setpoints for an inner Proportional-Summation-Difference (PSD) controller. The MPC-based governor is synthesized off-line as a Piecewise Affine (PWA) function that maps measurements onto optimal references. To achieve a fast and memory-efficient implementation, the PWA function is encoded as a binary search tree. This allows the reference governor to run on a sub-millisecond scale even on a very simple hardware. The proposed concept is experimentally verified on a laboratory device involving a magnetic levitation system. Here, the PSD controller is responsible for controlling the vertical position of the ball in the magnetic field. By using the reference governor, control performance can be significantly improved and input/output constraints enforced in a systematic manner.",51
"In rats, spreading depolarization induces vasodilation/hyperemia in naive tissue but the inverse response when artificial cerebrospinal fluid is topically applied to the brain containing (a) a nitric oxide-lowering agent and (b) elevated K+. The inverse response is characterized by severe vasoconstriction/ischemia. The perfusion deficit runs together with the depolarization in the tissue (=spreading ischemia). Here, we found in male Wistar rats that pre-treatment with artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing elevated K+ invivo led to a selective decline in alpha(2)/alpha(3) Na+/K+-ATPase activity, determined spectrophotometrically ex vivo. Moreover, spreading ischemia, recorded with laser-Doppler flowmetry and electrocorticography, resulted from artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing a nitric oxide-lowering agent in combination with the Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor ouabain at a concentration selectively inhibiting alpha(2)/alpha(3) activity. Decline in alpha(2)/alpha(3) activity results in increased Ca2+ uptake by internal stores of astrocytes, vascular myocytes, and pericytes since Ca2+ outflux via plasmalemmal Na+/Ca2+-exchanger declines. Augmented Ca2+ mobilization from internal stores during spreading depolarization might enhance vasoconstriction, thus, contributing to spreading ischemia. Accordingly, spreading ischemia was significantly shortened when intracellular Ca2+ stores were emptied by pre-treatment with thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA). These findings might have relevance for clinical conditions, in which spreading ischemia occurs such as delayed cerebral ischemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage.",69
"The spinel-type magnetic manganese ferrite (MnFe2O4) microspheres synthesized by simple solvothermal method were used as a novel adsorbent for selective enrichment and effective isolation of phosphopeptides. The uniform MnFe2O4 magnetic affinity microspheres (MAMSs) had a narrow particle size distribution between 250 and 260 nm, and displayed superparamagnetism with a saturation magnetization value of 67.0 emu/g. Comprehensively, the possible formation mechanism of MnFe2O4 microspheres with ferric and manganous sources as dual precursors was elucidated by comparison with those of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and MnOOH nanosheets respectively with either ferric or manganous source as single precursor. It was suggested that the spherical or sheet nanostructures could be achieved via secondary recrystallization or Ostwald ripening. The MnFe2O4 MAMSs probe exhibited excellent dispersibility in aqueous solution, and rapid magnetic separation within 15 s, as well as good reusability. More importantly, MnFe2O4 was highly selective for phosphopeptides because of the strong coordination interaction between metal ions (Fe3+ and Mn2+) and phosphate groups of phosphopeptdies. This high specificity was demonstrated by effectively enriching phosphopeptides from digest mixture of beta-casein and bovine serum albumin (BSA) with high content of non-phosphopeptides, and embodied further in phosphopeptides enrichment from non-fat milk digests and human serum. Consequently, the prepared MnFe2O4 affinity materials are expected to possess great potential in phosphoproteome research.",23
"In the present investigation, sensing electrode of an electrochemical CO2 gas sensor (plate type design) is engineered to overcome various observed failures such as dying out in short time due to Au/Pt diffusion into the material which discontinues the electrical contact and results into inadequate catalytic action. To improve the sensing electrode performance, a gradient sputtered Au coat is applied over it with increasing thickness towards the centre of the pellet. In another design, Au is loaded with varying concentration into the electrolyte material and its coat is applied on the electrolyte to overcome the diffusion. Performance of different sensors with varied configuration of catalyst Au is compared on the parameters namely stability and response time. The gradient sputtered electrode gave fast electrode kinetics, whereas sensor stability is found better for Au loaded material. An insight into effect of Au loading in the binary electrolyte (Li2CO3 +CaCO3) is obtained by complex impedance spectroscopy.",89
"With the development of the communication technology and the intelligent terminal, the artificial attendance based on the intelligent terminal technology and mobile communication technology is replaced by the attendance and replacement. Based on this, on the basis of existing research on the ALOHA anti-collision strategy, and improved it for mobile positioning attendance. Firstly, the algorithm design, and then gives terminal specific operation, and finally carried out experiments and comparative analysis of simulation results show that the improved ALOHA algorithm outperforms traditional anti-collision algorithm, ensuring the system has a shorter At the same time delay, can effectively improve the throughput performance.",35
"The malformation of sheet metal tapping screw threads in the screw threading process increases the cost of screw threading dies and their maintenance. Die factories do not reveal their screw threading die design techniques, so production and maintenance processes are established by trial-and-error or worker experience and passing down such techniques and documenting quality control is difficult. In this study, screw thread forming design and process analysis were carried out by combining computer-aided design software with computer-aided metal forming analysis software. Simulation results were verified in an actual forming process. The sheet metal tapping screw forging size error was less than 0.90%, except at a sharp angle, which was associated with an error of 3.075%, thereby demonstrating the accuracy of the simulated forming process. The numerical analysis process can be utilized to shorten forming development time; to reduce the number of die tests, and to improve product quality and die service life, reducing the cost of development and promoting the overall competitiveness of the company.",82
"In the last years, many clinical studies have revealed that some cisplatin-treated cancer survivors have a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular events, being cisplatin-induced cardiovascular toxicity an increasing concern. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the cardiovascular alterations induced by different chronic cisplatin treatments, and to identify some of the mechanisms involved. Direct blood pressure, basal cardiac (left ventricle and coronary arteries) and vascular (aortic and mesenteric) functions were evaluated in chronic (5 weeks) saline- or cisplatin-treated male Wistar rats. Three different doses of cisplatin were tested (1, 2, and 3 mg/kg/week). Alterations in cardiac and vascular tissues were also investigated by immunohistochemistry, Western Blot, and or quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Cisplatin treatment provoked a significant modification of arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and basal cardiac function at the maximum dose tested. However, vascular endothelial dysfunction occurred at lower doses. The expression of collagen fibers and conexin-43 were increased in cardiac tissue in cisplatin-treated rats with doses of 2 and 3 mg/kg/week. The expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase was also modified in cardiac and vascular tissues after cisplatin treatment. In conclusion, chronic cisplatin treatment provokes cardiac and vascular toxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Besides, vascular endothelial dysfunction occurs at lower doses than cardiac and systemic cardiovascular toxicity. Moreover, some structural changes in cardiac and vascular tissues are also patent even before any systemic cardiovascular alterations.",120
"This paper investigates the development of a mild hybrid powertrain system through the integration of a conventional manual transmission equipped powertrain and a secondary power source in the form of an electric motor driving the transmission output shaft. The primary goal of this paper is to study the performance of partial power-on gear shifts through the implementation of torque hole filling by the electric motor during gear changes. To achieve this goal, mathematical models of both conventional and mild hybrid powertrain are developed and used to compare the system dynamic performance of the two systems. This mathematical modelling is used to run different simulations for gearshift control algorithm design during system development, allowing us to evaluate the achievable performance and its dependency on system properties. The impact of motor power on the degree of torque hole compensation is also investigated, keeping in mind the practical limits to motor specification. This investigation uses both the output torque, vehicle speed as well as vibration dose value to evaluate the quality of gearshifts at different motor sizes. Results demonstrate that the torque hole may be eliminated using a motor power of 50 kW. However, the minimum vibration dose value during gear change is achieved using a peak power of 16-20 kW.

"The atmospheric effects that influence on the signal registered by remote sensors might be minimized in order to provide reliable spectral information. In aquatic systems, the application of atmospheric correction aims to minimize such effects and avoid the under or overestimation of remote sensing reflectance (R-rs). Accurately R-rs provides better information about the state of aquatic system, it means, establishing the concentration of aquatic compounds more precisely. The aim of this study is to evaluate the outputs from several atmospheric correction methods (Dark Object Subtraction DOS; Quick Atmospheric Correction - QUAC; Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Hypercubes - FLAASH; Atmospheric Correction for OLI 'lite' - ACOLITE, and Provisional Landsat-8 Surface Reflectance Algorithm - L8SR) in order to investigate the suitability of R-rs for estimating total suspended matter concentrations (TSM) in the Barra Bonita Hydroelectrical Reservoir. To establish TSM concentrations via atmospherically corrected Operational Land Imager (OLI) scene, the TSM retrieval model was calibrated and validated with in situ data. Thereby, the achieved results from TSM retrieval model application demonstrated that L8SR is able to provide the most suitable R-rs values for green and red spectral bands, and consequently, the lowest TSM retrieval errors (Mean Absolute Percentage Error about 10% and 12%, respectively). Retrieved R-rs from near infrared band is still a challenge for all the tested algorithms. (C) 2017 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",94
"To explore demographics, clinical and medication profiles, patients' social support, and perceived health status in HIV/TB coinfected patients in Guangxi, China. We performed a cross-sectional study in the HIV clinic of the Guigang City People's Hospital (N = 150). Health professionals conducted face-to-face interviews and collected data from patients' electronic medical records regarding patients' demographic, clinical, and medication information, as well as their social support and perceived health status. We classified all HIV/AIDS patients into HIV monoinfected and TB coinfected, at a ratio of 2: 1. ompared with the HIV monoinfected, patients with HIV/TB coinfection were more likely to be older, male, less educated, unemployed, carrying health insurance, having advanced stage of HIV infection, longer history with HIV, and other opportunistic infections. Patients coinfected with TB were also more likely to hold a negative belief that their HIV treatment could prevent exacerbations, and reported significantly worse emotional/informational support, social interaction, and perceived health status. Better social support and better self-efficacy to the HIV treatment adherence was significantly associated with better perceived health status among patients with HIV and TB coinfection. Having HIV/TB coinfection was associated with poorer perceived general well-being and mental health, particularly in those undergoing TB therapy. Our findings suggest the need for mental health referrals and medication management for coinfected individuals, as well as further efforts and policies to improve coordinated care.",132
"This paper presents the public health rationale for multipurpose prevention technologies (MPTs) for sexual and reproductive health (SRH) based on regional trends in demographic and SRH indicators. It then distils important lessons gleaned from the introduction of contraceptive and reproductive health products over the past several decades in order to inform the development and future introduction of MPTs for SRH. Principal results: A comparison of current demographic and public health regional data clearly revealed that the greatest confluence of women's SRH concerns occurs in sub-Saharan Africa and South/West Asia. These regional overlaps of SRH risks and outcomes present a strong rationale for developing MPTs designed to simultaneously protect against unintended pregnancy, HIV and other STIs. Information from acceptability, marketing, and operations research on the female condom, emergency contraception, pills and intravaginal rings identified key product characteristics and socio-behavioral issues to be considered in the development and introduction of MPTs. Product characteristics such as formulation, duration of action, presence and magnitude of side effects, prescription status (over-the-counter vs. prescribed), provider type and training and user perspectives, all contributed in varying degrees to both provider and user bias, and subsequent uptake of these family planning methods. Underlying socio-behavioral issues, including risk perception, ambivalence, and social costs also contributed to demand and use. Early identification of target populations will be critical to market shaping, demand creation and defining appropriate service delivery channels for MPTs. Ultimately, knowledge, attitudes, perceptions and practices of users (and their partners) will drive the success-or failure-of product introduction. Conclusions: MPTs provide a compelling response to the multiple and reinforcing SRH risks faced by women in key regions of the world, but specific product characteristics and their socio-behavioral correlates must be taken into account early in the development process. Successful introduction of new MPTs will require solid understanding of socio-behavioral correlates, effective demand generation, appropriate integration into health service delivery systems, quality counseling for proper use and active engagement of both public and private sectors.

"Objective: To determine whether there is an association between latitude and annual major depressive episode (MDE) prevalence in Canada. Methods: Data from 2 national survey programs (the National Population Health Survey and the Canadian Community Health Survey) were used, providing 10 data sets collected between 1996 and 2013, together including 922,260 respondents, of whom 495,739 were assessed for MDE using 1 of 2 versions of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, a short-form version (8 studies), and a Canadian adaptation of the World Mental Health version (2 studies). Approximate latitude was determined by linkage to postal code data. Data were analyzed using logistic regression and pooled across surveys using individual-level meta-analytic methods. Results: In models including latitude as a continuous variable, a statistically significant association was observed, with prevalence increasing with increasing latitude. This association persisted after adjustment for a set of known risk factors. The latitude gradient was modest in magnitude, a 1% to 2% increase in the prevalence odds of MDE per degree of latitude was observed. Due to sparse data, this gradient cannot be confidently generalized beyond major population centres, which tend to occur at less than 55 degrees latitude in Canada. Conclusion: A latitude gradient has not previously been reported. If replicated, the gradient may have implications for the planning of services and generation of aetiological hypotheses. However, this cross-sectional analysis cannot confirm aetiology and could not evaluate the potential contributions of variables such as light exposure, weather patterns, or social determinants.",71
"Due to the potential applications of the chaotic system, in recent years, the research of a new type of chaotic system and chaotic circuit is a hot spot. However, there are obvious differences between real characteristics and simulation results of the devices, such as the operational amplifier. In this paper, the simplified method of the circuit improvement is proposed, which achieves the same results between Multisim software simulation and actual circuit implementation. Meanwhile, impulsive synchronization method is applied to complete the synchronization control of the chaotic system. Compared with the original circuit, the proposed method of circuit improvement makes minor changes from the simulation circuit and is easy to be implemented, which can be applied for other chaotic systems.",60
"A hybrid structure consisting of iron oxide nanoparticles decorated on titania (TiO2) nanotube arrays has been synthesized by a very rapid forced hydrolysis method, followed by post annealing treatment. The morphology and structure analysis of the hybrid TiO2/Fe2O3 composites indicated uniform, conformal coating of the hematite nanoparticles on the anatase titania nanotubes. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was used to investigate the absorption properties of the TiO2/Fe2O3 structures. An increase in the absorbance of visible light in the range 380 nm to 600 nm has been observed when compared with pristine nanotubes. This is similar to the visible light absorbance enhancement observed in Ru-dye sensitized titania nanotubes. Thus iron oxide decorated titania nanotube demonstrate immense potential for use as inexpensive and robust materials for improved solar energy harvesting for photovoltaic applications.",100
"In order to solve the problem of embedding the watermark into the quantum color image, in this paper, an improved scheme of using small-scale quantum circuits and color scrambling is proposed. Both color carrier image and colorwatermark image are represented using novel enhanced quantum representation. The image sizes for carrier and watermark are assumed to be 2(n+1) x 2(n+2) and 2(n) x 2(n), respectively. At first, the color of pixels in watermark image is scrambled using the controlled rotation gates, and then, the scrambled watermark with 2(n) x 2(n) image size and 24-qubit gray scale is expanded to an image with 2(n+1) x 2(n+2) image size and 3-qubit gray scale. Finally, the expanded watermark image is embedded into the carrier image by the controlled-NOT gates. The extraction of watermark is the reverse process of embedding it into carrier image, which is achieved by applying operations in the reverse order. Simulation-based experimental results show that the proposed scheme is superior to other similar algorithms in terms of three items, visual quality, scrambling effect of watermark image, and noise resistibility.",90
"Because of its reconstructive nature, autobiographical memory (AM) is subject to a range of distortions. One distortion involves the erroneous incorporation of features from one episodic memory into another, forming what are known as memory conjunction errors. Healthy aging has been associated with an enhanced susceptibility to conjunction errors for laboratory stimuli, yet it is unclear whether these findings translate to the autobiographical domain. We investigated the impact of aging on vulnerability to AM conjunction errors, and explored potential cognitive processes underlying the formation of these errors. An imagination recombination paradigm was used to elicit AM conjunction errors in young and older adults. Participants also completed a battery of neuropsychological tests targeting relational memory and inhibition ability. Consistent with findings using laboratory stimuli, older adults were more susceptible to AM conjunction errors than younger adults. However, older adults were not differentially vulnerable to the inflating effects of imagination. Individual variation in AM conjunction error vulnerability was attributable to inhibitory capacity. An inability to suppress the cumulative familiarity of individual AM details appears to contribute to the heightened formation of AM conjunction errors with age.",78
"Despite improved awareness of work-related diseases and preventive measures, many workers are still at high risk of developing occupational hypersensitivity airway diseases. This stems from a lack of knowledge of bioaerosol composition and their potential effects on human health. Recently, archaea species were identified in bioaerosols, raising the possibility that they play a major role in exposure-related pathology. Specifically, Methanosphaera stadtmanae (MSS) and Methanobrevibacter smithii (MBS) are found in high concentrations in agricultural environments and respiratory exposure to crude extract demonstrates immunomodulatory activity in mice. Nevertheless, our knowledge of the specific impact of methanogens exposure on airway immunity and their potential to induce airway hypersensitivity responses in workers remains scant. Analysis of the lung mucosal response to methanogen crude extracts in mice demonstrated that MSS and MBS predominantly induced T(H)17 airway inflammation, typical of a type IV hypersensitivity response. Furthermore, the response to MSS was associated with antigen-specific IgG(1) and IgG(2a) production. However, despite the presence of eosinophils after MSS exposure, only a weak T(H)2 response and no airway hyperresponsiveness were observed. Finally, using eosinophil and mast cell-deficient mice, we confirmed that these cells are dispensable for the T(H)17 response to MSS, although eosinophils likely contribute to the exacerbation of inflammatory processes induced by MSS crude extract exposure. We conclude that, as MSS induces a clear type IV hypersensitivity lung response, it has the potential to be harmful to workers frequently exposed to this methanogen, and that preventive measures should be taken to avoid chronic hypersensitivity disease development in workers.",109
"Background. An understanding of the exact nature of executive function (EF) deficits in conduct disorder (CD) remains elusive because of issues of co-morbidity with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Method. Seventy-two adolescents with CD, 35 with CD +ADHD and 20 healthy controls (HCs) were assessed on a computerized battery of putative 'cool' and 'hot' EFs. Participants also completed the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL). Results. In the cool EF tasks such as planning, the CD +ADHD group in particular showed most notable impairments compared to HCs. This pattern was less evident for set shifting and behavioural inhibition but there were significant correlations between errors scores on these tasks and indices of externalizing behaviours on the CBCL across the sample. For hot EF tasks, all clinical groups performed worse than HCs on delay of gratification and poor performance was correlated with externalizing scores. Although there were no notable group differences on the punishment-based card-playing task, there were significant correlations between ultimate payout and externalizing behaviour across groups. Conclusions. Overall, our findings highlight the fact that there may be more common than distinguishing neuropsychological underpinnings to these co-morbid disorders and that a dimensional symptom-based approach may be the way forward.",73

Three reports considered both biochemistry and immunology, while another reported an advance in the identification of chromosomal abnormalities. The present report will summarise key aspects of these publications that are of greatest relevance to laboratory scientists.",33
"Energy use in buildings is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change; the residential sector uses more than 20% of the energy in the United States. For this reason among others it is important to implement sustainable design practices in construction. Previous research has shown that there are significant barriers to doing so and that sustainability is not a main consideration in choosing the structural system. To improve understanding of structural engineers' attitudes toward sustainability, an opinion survey was conducted in Oregon and Washington. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used. Results highlight lack of information as a major barrier to adopting sustainable design practices. Respondents request standardized, current, and reputable data applicable to codes and standards. Results also indicate that clients are the most important influence on structural engineers. Results suggest that structural engineers should expand their thinking about both techniques and how engineering fits in the larger context of sustainable development. Results also suggest that the profession as a whole needs to become more assertive in advising and educating clients about sustainability. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",99
"A promising development in the design of datacenters is the hybrid network architecture consisting of both optical and electrical elements, in which end-to-end traffic can be routed through either an electrical path or an optical path. The core optical switch is used to dynamically create optical paths between pairs of electrical edge-switches in such a datacenter network. In this context, the joint problem of bandwidth allocation and VM-placement poses new and different challenges not addressed yet in hybrid datacenter. In particular, we foresee two issues: (i) the number of edge-switches that can be simultaneously reached using optical paths from an edge-switch is limited by the size of the optical switch, (ii) the dynamic creation of optical paths can potentially establish a constrained optical network topology leading to poor performance. In this work, we abstract the requests of tenants as virtual networks, and study the problem of embedding virtual networks on a hybrid datacenter. We formulate the problem as a non-linear optimization problem and analyze its complexity. We develop and analyse three algorithms for embedding dynamically arriving virtual network demands on a hybrid optical-electrical datacenter. Through simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of not only exploiting the already established optical paths, but also of using electrical network in embedding requests of virtual networks.

"Chemical and enzymatic barriers in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract hamper the oral delivery of many labile drugs. The GI epithelium also contributes to poor permeability for numerous drugs. Drugs with poor aqueous solubility have difficulty dissolving in the GI tract, resulting in low bioavailability. Nanomedicine provides an opportunity to improve the delivery efficiency of orally administered drugs. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are categorized as a new generation of lipid nanoparticles consisting of a complete solid lipid matrix. SLNs used for oral administration offer several benefits over conventional formulations, including increased solubility, enhanced stability, improved epithelium permeability and bioavailability, prolonged half-life, tissue targeting, and minimal side effects. The nontoxic excipients and sophisticated material engineering of SLNs tailor the controllable physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles for GI penetration via mucosal or lymphatic transport. In this review, we highlight the recent progress in the development of SLNs for disease treatment. Recent application of oral SLNs includes therapies for cancers, central nervous system-related disorders, cardiovascular-related diseases, infection, diabetes, and osteoporosis. In addition to drugs that may be active cargos in SLNs, some natural compounds with pharmacological activity are also suitable for SLN encapsulation to enhance oral bioavailability. In this article, we systematically introduce the concepts and amelioration mechanisms of the nanomedical techniques for drug-and natural compound-loaded SLNs.

"Because wildfire size and frequency are expected to increase in many forested areas in the United States, organizations involved in forest and wildfire management could arguably benefit from working together and sharing information to develop strategies for how to adapt to this increasing risk. Social capital theory suggests that actors in cohesive networks are positioned to build trust and mutual understanding of problems and act collectively to address these problems, and that actors engaged with diverse partners are positioned to access new information and resources that are important for innovation and complex problem solving. We investigated the patterns of interaction within a network of organizations involved in forest and wildfire management in Oregon, USA, for evidence of structural conditions that create opportunities for collective action and learning. We used descriptive statistical analysis of social network data gathered through interviews to characterize the structure of the network and exponential random graph modeling to identify key factors in the formation of network ties. We interpreted our findings through the lens of social capital theory to identify implications for the network's capacity to engage in collective action and complex problem-solving about how to adapt to environmental change. We found that tendencies to associate with others with similar management goals, geographic emphases, and attitudes toward wildfire were strong mechanisms shaping network structure, potentially constraining interactions among organizations with diverse information and resources and limiting opportunities for learning and complex problem-solving needed for adaptation. In particular, we found that organizations with fire protection and forest restoration goals comprised distinct networks despite sharing concern about the problem of increasing wildfire risk.",81
"Adhesively bonded joints have found important application areas in the marine and offshore industry during the last years. One particular application is the use of bonded patches to repair steel structures such as floating production storage and offloading units (FPSOs). Experience has shown that FPSOs develop corrosion and cracks during service. Welding, which is frequently applied when repairing such kinds of defects, is hot work that is not allowed for FPSOs during production. Closing down the production can be very expensive. Thus, composite patch repair using adhesives is an attractive alternative, which means that there is a need to investigate the strength of bonded steel-composite joints. In the present paper, the strength of adhesively bonded lap-shear joints has been studied. Failure loads obtained experimentally have been presented and compared with theoretical predictions. Capacity estimates provided by traditional strength of materials approaches do not agree with experiments. On the other hand, results obtained by a recent inelastic fracture-based analysis represent measured strength values well. Furthermore, finite element analysis using cohesive elements for the adhesive bondline is shown to be a powerful tool in strength predictions of adhesively bonded joints. In addition to provide accurate estimates of the ultimate failure loads, the fracture process can be modelled, and the analysis method is applicable to a wide range of joint geometries.

"Mountainous vegetation recovery after major earthquakes has important implications for preventing postseismic soil erosion and geo-hazards. However, regional recovery processes of the postseismic vegetation and its spatial patterns have not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we examined the vegetation recovery processes following the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (Ms. 7.8) using 16-day intervalMODIS normalized difference vegetation index time series from 2000 to 2014. The Savitzky-Golay filter and cross-correlogram spectral matching were used to eliminate the influences of cloud and intraannual phenology. Change vector analysis was applied to measure the postseismic vegetation recovery conditions for each year. We find that the heavily affected vegetation areas are mainly located along the southern part of the earthquake surface rupture. Additionally, five major affected vegetation types have been identified: shrubland, grassland, broadleaf/mixed, needleleaf, and plantation. Shrubland represents the largest fraction of vegetation type in the heavily affected area, whereas plantation comprises the smallest fraction of vegetation type in the heavily affected area. Further analysis indicates that the changing trend of postseismic vegetation conditions in the first six years can be grouped into three classes: recovering, fluctuating, and deteriorating. Recovering and fluctuating classes cover 59% and 37% of the heavily affected areas, respectively, and are the two dominant postseismic vegetation classes. In contrast, the deteriorating recovery class covers just 4% of the affected areas. The recovering vegetation is primarily located around the epicenter, and most of the fluctuating classes is located to the northeast of the epicenter. These results demonstrate that the Wenchuan earthquake has long-term and important influences on mountain vegetation, andmore attention should be given to the locations of deteriorating and fluctuating vegetation following mountain disasters.",94
"BackgroundNursing plays a central role in facilitating care transitions for complex older adults, yet there is no consensus of the components of nurse-led care transitions interventions to facilitate high quality care transitions among complex older adults. A structured expert panel was established with the purpose of identifying effective nurse-led care transition interventions. MethodsA modified Delphi consensus technique based on the RAND method was employed. Panelists (n = 23) were asked to individually rate a series of statements derived from a realist synthesis of the literature for relevance, feasibility and likely impact. Statements receiving an aggregate score of 75% (7/9) were reviewed and revised at a face-to-face consensus meeting. A second round of rating following the same process as round one was used, followed by a final ranking of the statements. ResultsThe five highest ranked intervention components and contextual factors were: (a) educating and coaching patients, their family members and caregivers about self-management skills; (b) ensuring patients, their family members and caregivers are aware of follow-up medical appointments and postdischarge care plan; (c) using standardized documentation tools and comprehensive communication strategies during care transitions; (d) optimizing nurses' roles and scopes of practice across the care transitions spectrum; and (e) having strong leadership, strategic alignment and accountability structures in organizations to enable quality care transitions for the complex older person population. Linking Evidence to ActionKey insights on optimizing the nurses' roles and scope of practice during care transitions included having nurses provide warm hand-offs and serve as the go-to person. The panel also identified current challenges to optimizing the nurses' roles and scope of practice across care transition points. Future research is required to determine effective nurse-led intervention components and in which context do they work or do not.",66
"Logitech made the following statement in 2009: ""Since the displacements of a mouse would not give any useful information to a hacker, the mouse reports are not encrypted."" In this paper, we prove the exact opposite is true-i.e., it is indeed possible to leak sensitive information such as passwords through the displacements of a Bluetooth mouse. Our results can be easily extended to other wireless mice using different radio links. We begin by presenting multiple ways to sniff unencrypted Bluetooth packets containing raw mouse movement data. We then show that such data may reveal text-based passwords entered by clicking on software keyboards. We propose two attacks, the prediction attack and replay attack, which can reconstruct the on-screen cursor trajectories from sniffed mouse movement data. Two inference strategies are used to discover passwords from cursor trajectories. We conducted a holistic study over all popular operating systems and analyzed how mouse acceleration algorithms and packet losses may affect the reconstruction results. Our real-world experiments demonstrate the severity of privacy leakage from unencrypted Bluetooth mice. We also discuss countermeasures to prevent privacy leakage from wireless mice. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to demonstrate privacy leakage from raw mouse data.",68
"In this paper, a unified algebraic transformation approach is presented for designing parallel recursive and adaptive digital filters and singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithms. The approach is based on the explorations of some algebraic properties of the target algorithms' representations. Several typical modern digital signal processing examples are presented to illustrate the applications of the technique. They include the cascaded orthogonal recursive digital filter, the Givens rotation-based adaptive inverse QR algorithm for channel equalization, and the QR decomposition-based SVD algorithms. All three examples exhibit similar throughput constraints. There exist long feedback loops in the algorithms' signal flow graph representation, and the critical path is proportional to the size of the problem, Applying the proposed algebraic transformation techniques, parallel architectures are obtained for all three examples, For cascade orthogonal recursive filter, retiming transformation and orthogonal matrix decompositions (or pseudo-commutativity) are applied to obtain parallel filter architectures with critical path of five Givens rotations. For adaptive inverse QR algorithm, the commutativity and associativity of the matrix multiplications are applied to obtain parallel architectures with critical path of either four Givens rotations or three Givens rotations plus two multiply-add operations, whichever turns out to be larger. For SVD algorithms, retiming and associativity of the matrix multiplications are applied to derive parallel architectures with critical path of eight Givens rotations. The critical paths of all parallel architectures are independent of the problem size as compared with being proportional to the problem size in the original sequential algorithms. Parallelism is achieved at the expense of slight increase (or the same for the SVD case) in the algorithms' computational complexity.",56
"In this study, earthworms Eisenia fetida (E fetida) were exposed to a soil artificially contaminated with individual hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) diastereoisomers (alpha-, beta- and gamma-HBCDs) to investigate the distribution, isomerization and enantiomer selectivity of HBCDs at tissue and subcellular levels. At the tissue level, the concentrations of HBCDs all followed the order of gut >bodyfluid >body wall, which suggested that earthworms accumulated HBCDs mainly via ingesting soil particles. At the subcellular level, the concentrations of HBCDs in an extracellular fraction consisting of granules, tissue fragment, cell membrane and intact cells (fraction A) were higher than those in an intracellular fractions consisting of the microsomal and cytosol (fraction B + C). This confirmed the passive diffusion during the distribution of HBCDs into the intracellular compartment. The distribution proportions of HBCDs varied among different tissue and subcellular fractions, and all changed over time within 14 days. The variable distributions of HBCDs in different fractions were a result of the comprehensive effects of dynamics and thermodynamics processes. The beta- and gamma-HBCDs were isomerized to alpha-HBCD in all tissue and subcellular fractions except for fraction C, and the isomerization ratios varied a lot, which seemed to be related to HBCDs residence time. The selective enrichment of (-)alpha-, (-)beta and (-)gamma-HBCDs was found in all fractions and this is consistent with that in the whole earthworm. Besides, the extents of enantio-selectivity did not change significantly among different tissue and subcellular fractions.",88
"Since the lacZ alpha-based blue/white screening system was introduced to molecular biology, several different visual reporter systems were developed and used for various purposes in Escherichia coli. A common limit to the existent visual reporter systems is that an extracellular chromogenic substrate has to be added for the visible pigment production. In this study, we developed a new blue/white screening system based on a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase encoded by idgS from Streptomyces and a phosphopantetheinyl transferase encoded by sfp from Bacillus. When IdgS is activated from an apo-form to a holo-form via a posttranslational modification catalyzed by Sfp, it can synthesize a blue pigment indigoidine using L-glutamine, the amino acid abundant in cells, as a substrate. The new blue/white screening system contains a recipient E. coli strain with an optimized idgS gene cassette and a cloning vector harboring an sfp gene with an in-frame insertion of a multiple cloning site close to its N-terminal. We demonstrated that the IdgS/Sfp-based blue/white screening system is a powerful alternative to the lacZ alpha-based screening system, which does not require any external substrate addition.",30
"Using a dot-probe discrimination task and a between-subjects design, we examined the time course of attentional biases (facilitated attention, delayed disengagement, and avoidance) toward thin versus fat bodies and explored the influence of body dissatisfaction (BD) on attention allocation among a sample of 163 women from the general population. Three stimulus presentation times were used: 100 ms, 500 ms, and 1500 ms. We also used neutral body-shape-related stimuli as neutral stimuli related to the concept of interest to overcome the limitations of previous studies. At 500 ms, the results highlighted delayed disengagement from very thin and negatively assessed bodies among women with high BD. This mechanism, which leads to attentional focalization on bodies that are difficult to achieve, might be considered dysfunctional because it may maintain or reinforce BD. Results at 100 ms and 1500 ms, as well as results for fat bodies, were not conclusive. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",67
"Over the past few years, reversible watermarking techniques for relational databases have been proposed to provide protection of ownership rights, data tempering, and data integrity. Mainly, these techniques ensure original data recovery from watermarked data, whereas irreversible watermarking schemes only protect ownership rights. This characteristic of reversible watermarking has emerged as a candidate solution for the protection of ownership rights of data, intolerable to modifications such as medical data, genetic data, credit card, and bank account data. The main objective of this paper is to make an extensive survey of the state-of-the-art in reversible watermarking techniques for relational databases to reflect recent research progress and to point out the key issues for future research. In order to analyze these techniques, a classification has been performed on the basis of (i) the extent of modifications introduced by the watermarking scheme in the underlying data and (ii) the robustness of the embedded watermark against malicious attacks.

"Elastic modulus to the circumferential direction of carotid artery is important to evaluate the degree of arteriosclerosis. Previous methods have utilized the magnitude of systaltic movement of carotid wall to estimates the elastic modulus. Because the magnitude depends on the elastic modulus of surrounding tissues around carotid artery as well as that of carotid artery itself, the previous methods results in overestimates of carotid elastic modulus. We then modeled both carotid artery and surrounding tissues with a two-layered combinational cylinder from the view point of Theory about Strength of Materials. Utilizing the systaltic movement of a point in surrounding tissues as well as that of carotid wall, we estimate the ""self-""elastic modulus of carotid artery by excluding influence of surrounding tissues. We further measured carotid elastic modulus in vitro for animal by tensile test. The results agree with our in vivo estimation.",91
"Experiments conducted to quantify potential leakage from holes in two geomembranes [1-mm-thick linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) and 2-mm-thick high-density polyethylene (HDPE)] placed on a silty-sand [underliner hydraulic conductivity (kUL), 1.1x10-7kUL1.2x10-5m/s], or pea gravel (kUL=1x10-2m/s) underliner (foundation/subgrade) and covered with saturated fine tailings at 65% initial solids content are discussed [tailings hydraulic conductivity (kT), 2.9x10-8kT1.6x10-6m/s]. Tests results show that the overlying tailings, with a kT<kUL, filled the geomembrane hole and had a larger effect on flow through the hole than the underliners examined. For the tested conditions, leakage through 10 and 20-mm-diameter holes were essentially the same whereas the leakage through a 1.5-mm-diameter hole was three orders of magnitude lower. Introduction of a 580g/m2 nonwoven needle-punched geotextile (GTX) layer between the geomembrane and tailings increased the flow by approximately 60%. A gap below geomembrane hole attributable to a stone on the underliner filled with tailings, which flowed through the hole. The evidence of fines migration through the hole, from the tailings to the underliner is discussed.",93
"The inclusion compounds between iron II lactate and three different cyclodextrins (CDs) were studied by means of experimental and theoretical data. The importance of iron H in the human metabolism effort the necessity of a minimum concentration to the human life. Malnutrition is one great problem in social politics of many countries on the world. The, possibility to the development of novel medicines with the iron II species stable look for an increase on the efficiency for this kind of aid. Kinetics measurements confirm the possibility to stop the oxidation reaction. It was the first indication of efficient molecular encapsulation. Diffusion coefficient measurements were carried out by Taylor-Aris diffusion technique. The decrease of diffusion coefficients measured for iron H lactate when alone and forming the inclusion complexes was obtained for all hosts molecules used. Molecular Mechanics calculations were performed to elucidate the perfect arrange of iron II lactate inside CDs cavity. No great differences were obtained to the binding energy for the different hosts.

"Infrared detectors are the core of infrared imaging systems, while readout integrated circuits are the key components of detectors. In order to grasp the performance of circuits quickly and accurately, a method of circuit modeling using Verilog-A language is proposed, which present a behavioral simulation model for the ROIC. At first, a typical capacitor trans-impedance amplifier(CTIA) ROIC unit is showed, then the two essential parts of it, operational amplifier and switch are modeled on behavioral level. The op amp model concludes these non-ideal factors, such as finite gain-bandwidth product, input and output offset, output resistance and so on. Non-deal factors that affect switches are considered in the switch behavioral model, such as rise and fall time, on-resistance and so on. At last time-domain modeling method for noise is presented, which is compared with the classical frequency domain method for difference. The analysis results shows that in the situation that noise interested bandwidth(NIBW) is more than 5MHz, the difference between the two methods leads to less than 1% if the sample rate of noise is larger 4 times of the NIBW",60
"Midkine (MK; gene name, Mdk), a heparin-binding growth factor, regulates cell growth, cell survival, migration and anti-apoptotic activity in nephrogenesis and development. In the kidney, MK is expressed mainly in proximal tubular epithelial cells and is induced by oxidative stress through the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha. The pathophysiological roles of MK are diverse, ranging from the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) to progression of chronic kidney disease, often accompanied by hypertension, renal ischemia and diabetic nephropathy. In particular, hypertension has indispensable implications for various vascular diseases, including cardiovascular and renal disorders. Mdk(+/+) mice exhibited marked hypertension in renal ablation model compared with Mdk(-/-) mice, eventually leading to more progressive renal failure such as glomerular sclerosis and tubulointerstitial injuries in association with elevated plasma angiotensin (Ang) II levels. MK is also induced in the lung endothelium by oxidative stress and subsequently up-regulated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the lung. Ang II is hydrolyzed by ACE to induce further oxidative stress, accelerating MK generation and leading to a vicious cycle of positive feedback on the MK-Ang II pathway. The kidney-lung interaction involving positive feedback between the renin-angiotensin system and MK may in part account for the pathogenesis of hypertension and kidney injury. In addition to this pathway, MK is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy and AKI through the recruitment of the inflammatory cells. Such multidisciplinary findings may open new avenues for targeting therapies for hypertension and various renal diseases, including AKI and diabetic nephropathy.",5
"Context: Youth exposure to explicit film violence and sex is linked to adverse health outcomes and is a serious public health concern. The Motion Picture Association of America's (MPAA's) rating system's effectiveness in reducing youth exposure to harmful content has been questioned. Purpose: To determine the MPAA's rating system's effectiveness in screening explicit violence and sex since the system's initiation (1968) and the introduction of the PG-13 category (1984). Also, to examine evidence of less restrictive ratings over time (""ratings creep''). Design: Top-grossing movies from 1950 to 2006 (N = 855) were coded for explicitness of violent and sexual content. Trends in rating assignments and in the content of different rating categories since 1968 were assessed. Results: The explicitness of violent and sexual content significantly increased following the rating system's initiation. The system did not differentiate violent content as well as sexual content, and ratings creep was only evident for violent films. Explicit violence in R-rated films increased, while films that would previously have been rated R were increasingly assigned to PG-13. This pattern was not evident for sex; only R-rated films exhibited higher levels of explicit sex compared to preratings period. Conclusions: While relatively effective for screening explicit sex, the rating system has allowed increasingly violent content into PG-13 films, thereby increasing youth access to more harmful content. Assignment of films in the current rating system should be more sensitive to the link between violent media exposure and youth violence. (C) 2010 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is very common in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), with approximately two-thirds having a diagnosis of the disease. Currently, the only validated treatment for NAFLD is weight loss. A number of studies of animal models and human trials have evaluated the effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) on liver fat content and suggest that the treatment could represent a new alternative for NAFLD management. In this review, our focus is on the main studies regarding the effects of GLP-1RAs on NAFLD. Also, the mechanisms that might explain their beneficial effects on liver diseases are analyzed.

"Background: In clinical practice, laboratory results are often important for making diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic decisions. Interpreting individual results relies on accurate reference intervals and decision limits. Despite the considerable amount of resources in clinical medicine spent on elderly patients, accurate reference intervals for the elderly are rarely available. The SENIORLAB study set out to determine reference intervals in the elderly by investigating a large variety of laboratory parameters in clinical chemistry, hematology, and immunology. Methods/design: The SENIORLAB study is an observational, prospective cohort study. Subjectively healthy residents of Switzerland aged 60 years and older were included for baseline examination (n=1467), where anthropometric measurements were taken, medical history was reviewed, and a fasting blood sample was drawn under optimal preanalytical conditions. More than 110 laboratory parameters were measured, and a biobank was set up. The study participants are followed up every 3 to 5 years for quality of life, morbidity, and mortality. The primary aim is to evaluate different laboratory parameters at age-related reference intervals. The secondary aims of this study include the following: identify associations between different parameters, identify diagnostic characteristics to diagnose different circumstances, identify the prevalence of occult disease in subjectively healthy individuals, and identify the prognostic factors for the investigated outcomes, including mortality. Discussion: To obtain better grounds to justify clinical decisions, specific reference intervals for laboratory parameters of the elderly are needed. Reference intervals are obtained from healthy individuals. A major obstacle when obtaining reference intervals in the elderly is the definition of health in seniors because individuals without any medical condition and any medication are rare in older adulthood. Reference intervals obtained from such individuals cannot be considered representative for seniors in a status of age-specific normal health. In addition to the established methods for determining reference intervals, this longitudinal study utilizes a unique approach, in that survival and long-term well-being are taken as indicators of health in seniors. This approach is expected to provide robust and representative reference intervals that are obtained from an adequate reference population and not a collective of highly selected individuals.",33
"Maintaining safe operation of chemical processes and meeting environmental constraints are issues of paramount importance in the area of process systems and control engineering, and are ideally achieved while maximizing economic profit. It has long been argued that process safety is fundamentally a process control problem, yet few research efforts have been directed toward integrating the rather disparate domains of process safety and process control. Economic model predictive control (EMPC) has attracted significant attention recently due to its ability to optimize process operation accounting directly for process economics considerations. However, there is very limited work on the problem of integrating safety considerations in EMPC to ensure simultaneous safe operation and maximization of process profit. Motivated by the above considerations, this work develops three EMPC schemes that adjust in real-time the size of the safety sets in which the process state should reside to ensure safe process operation and feedback control of the process state while optimizing economics via time-varying process operation. Recursive feasibility and closed-loop stability are established for a sufficiently small EMPC sampling period. The proposed schemes, which effectively integrate feedback control, process economics, and safety considerations, are demonstrated with a chemical process example.

"Recent studies on the association between particular single nucleotide polymorphisms of serine-threonine kinase with no lysine (K) 4 gene (WNK4) and essential hypertension have yielded controversial results. Here, frequencies of Ala589Ser polymorphism within exon 8 of the WNK4 gene were assessed among 259 unrelated ethnic Chinese patients with essential hypertension and 235 strictly matched normotensive controls. All subjects were derived from a relatively isolated population identified in the Kerqin desert region in Zhangwu county of Liaoning, northeastern China, which features a dry climate and the people having a high dietary salt intake, in addition to a significantly higher prevalence (similar to 35%) of essential hypertension. Genotypes were verified with polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and confirmed by direct sequencing. Expression pattern and regulatory mechanisms of the WNK4 gene were also explored using Northern blotting and in vitro hormone stimulation assays. Strong associations between the Ala589Ser polymorphism and both raised systolic and diastolic blood pressures were identified. In addition to the kidneys, WNK4 gene expression was also found in many other organs. Several cis-acting elements had been discovered in the promoter region of the gene. As revealed by preliminary experiment, various hormones can down-regulate the expression of WNK4, among which glucocorticoid hormone seems to act in a dose-dependent manner. The WNK4 gene probably plays an important role in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension. As a missense mutation, the Ala589Ser polymorphism may bring changes to the enzyme's function(s), resulting in increased susceptibility to the disease.",38
"Transgenerational patterns of child rearing practices have been implicated in the maintenance of psychosocial problems across generations. Understanding such patterns has been an important aim of research in developmental psychology for decades. Recently, it has been suggested that individuals' current parenting practices are strongly influenced by their early maladaptive schemata, which are thought to arise from their own childhood experiences with their caregivers. In the context of family interventions, increasing parental mindfulness has been proposed to reduce the effects of such schemata. However, there is currently no research testing the possible interrelationships among these variables in community samples. The first aim of the current study was, therefore, to test the associations between parents' perceptions of their own aversive childhood experiences with their caregivers, the extent of their early maladaptive schemata, and their current level of perceived parenting competence. The second aim was to explore whether parents' level of mindfulness is moderating or mediating this relationship. A community sample of 145 parents completed a packet of self-report questionnaires. Results of path analyses indicated that participants' early maladaptive schemata mediated the relationship between their perception of their own childhood experiences with their caregivers and their current sense of parental competence. Furthermore, stronger early maladaptive schemata were related to lower levels of mindfulness, which in turn was associated with lower levels of parental competence. Our results provide an important initial step towards exploring the potential role of mindfulness in the intergenerational transmission of parenting practices in the community.",18
"The Legendre sequence possesses several desirable features of pseudorandomness in view of different applications such as a high linear complexity (profile) for cryptography and a small (aperiodic) autocorrelation for radar, gps, or sonar. Here we prove the first nontrivial bound on its arithmetic autocorrelation, another figure of merit introduced by Mandelbaum for error correcting codes.",57
"The performance of electrical machines is ultimately limited by thermal issues. To facilitate the modelling and speed up the time to market of novel designs, the accuracy, efficiency and reliability of thermal models has to be improved. In the literature, the majority of thermal models of electrical machines are based on lumped-parameter thermal networks, which are both efficient and simple to implement. Accuracy is the main concern related to this approach. Moreover, the outputs of these thermal models are average temperatures, which are not a suitable constraint for the machine design. In this work we introduce an improved lumped parameter configuration based on a novel structure: the Distributed Losses and Capacitance (DLC) element. The DLC is able to accurately estimate local temperatures at steady-state or during transients with a high Biot number or high aspect ratios. We validate the approach experimentally, creating a thermal model of an external-rotor Surface-mounted Permanent Magnet (SPM) machine. The error in the estimation of the end-windings temperature is within 4%.",85
"One of the main aims of the green building movement has been a desire to create a healthy indoor environment for building occupants. In terms of improving or enhancing occupant well-being, a unique case emerges for healthcare facilities, whose main existence is based on the principles of improving the health of their patients. In the U.S., the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system has become the most widely recognized and used certification system for green buildings, including green hospital buildings. However, hospitals with high total scores may be green buildings but not necessarily the optimal green healthcare environment from a patient's wellbeing perspective. The goal of the study was to identify whether hospitals and healthcare facilities actually value the specific criteria that influence the health of patients and their recovery period. In-depth analysis of LEED healthcare specific credits revealed general tendencies and practices for green healthcare buildings. Based on a statistical analysis, the mean of percent healthcare specific scores were calculated as 48% for those certified under LEED Healthcare, 62% for hospitals certified under LEED New Construction v3, and 52% for hospitals certified under LEED New Construction v2 rating systems. While hospitals included in the Healthcare category were initially expected to be the most successful ones in terms of achieving patient recovery and wellbeing related credits, they proved to earn the lowest percent of relevant points in this analysis. The result may be attributed to heightened restrictions and requirements of credits in the Healthcare scorecard, or hospitals may be valuing the level of certification more than those credits that were deemed relevant for patient wellbeing and rate of recovery, either due to lack of information or due to economic constraints. A high correlation coefficient was calculated among total scores and healthcare specific scores for the Healthcare dataset. On the other hand, correlation coefficients calculated for the other two datasets indicate a more random pattern among the two variables. For hospitals certified under the New Construction rating system, there seem to be weak support to claim that hospitals that receive high total scores and thus certification levels have high healthcare specific points as well.",99
"This paper describes a strategy to identify the authorship of online handwritten documents. We regard our research framework to that of a retrieval problem and adapt the so called codebook based Vector of Local Aggregate descriptor (VLAD) that has been promising for the object retrieval application in image processing. The codebook comprises a set of code vectors with associated Voronoi cells computed from a clustering algorithm on a set of feature vectors along the online trace. However, we show that the VLAD formulation at times, cannot effectively discriminate between writers, when their respective feature vectors are not linearly separable in the Voronoi cell of the code vectors. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel descriptor that improves upon the VLAD formulation. Secondly, we explore a normalization for the feature vectors prior to the generation of the VLAD. Our method is different to the min-max and z-score in that it takes care in ensuring that the codevectors are not influenced by the presence of outliers in the data. The performance of our proposed descriptor with the new feature normalization are evaluated on two publicly available Online Handwriting Databases - the IAM and IBM-UB1. The results show a marked improvement over the VLAD. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",90
"Studies have reported that intraplaque neovascularisation (IPN) is closely correlated with plaque vulnerability. In this study, a new image processing approach, differential intensity projection (DIP), was developed to visualise and quantify IPN in contrast-enhanced non-linear ultrasound image sequences of carotid arteries. DIP used the difference between the local temporal maximum and the local temporal average signals to identify bubbles against tissue non-linear artefact and noise. The total absolute and relative areas occupied by bubbles within each plaque were calculated to quantify IPN. In vitro measurements on a laboratory phantom were made, followed by in vivo measurements in which 24 contrast-enhanced non-linear ultrasound image sequences of carotid arteries from 48 patients were selected and motion corrected. The results using DIP were compared with those obtained by maximum intensity projection (MIP) and visual assessment. The results indicated that DIP can significantly reduce non-linear propagation tissue artefacts and is much more specific in detecting bubble signals than MIP, being able to reveal microbubble signals that are buried in tissue artefacts in the corresponding MIP image. A good correlation was found between microvascular area (MVA) (r 5 0.83, p, 0.001)/ microvascular density (r50.77, p, 0.001) obtained using DIP and the corresponding expert visual grades, comparing favourably to r 5 0.26 and 0.23 obtained using MIP on the same data. In conclusion, the proposed method exhibits great potential in quantification of IPN in contrast-enhanced ultrasound images of carotid arteries.

"We explored the relationship between sleep patterns and sleep disorders and mammographic density (MD), a marker of breast cancer risk. Participants in the DDM-Spain/var-DDM study, which included 2878 middle-aged Spanish women, were interviewed via telephone and asked questions on sleep characteristics. Two radiologists assessed MD in their left craneo-caudal mammogram, assisted by a validated semiautomatic-computer tool (DM-scan). We used log-transformed percentage MD as the dependent variable and fitted mixed linear regression models, including known confounding variables. Our results showed that neither sleeping patterns nor sleep disorders were associated with MD. However, women with frequent changes in their bedtime due to anxiety or depression had higher MD (e(beta):1.53;95%Cl:1.04-2.26). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",108
"Adolescent poverty is associated with increased antisocial and decreased prosocial behaviors. Attenuating these negative effects is relevant for both individual and societal well-being. Research exploring how youth in poverty can escape antisocial behaviors and move toward prosocial behaviors has been limited primarily to risk factors. From a strengths perspective, we sought to understand how a potential resiliency factor-purpose in life-could protect youngsters from the deleterious effects of poverty. We conceptualized purpose in life as a central, future-oriented, goal-organizing framework that provides adolescents reasons to resist antisocial behavior and engage in prosocial behaviors. In moderation analyses, purpose in life mitigated the effects of poverty on antisocial behavior (i.e., disobedience and bullying), but failed to boost prosocial traits and behaviors for youth in poverty. We emphasize the importance of developing a sense of purpose in economically disadvantaged youth for bettering their lives and communities.",65
"The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the measurement structure of the Perceived Empathic and Social Self-Efficacy Scale amongst 194 individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) and (2) to establish construct validity for the Perceived Empathic and Social Self-Efficacy Scale. Confirmatory factor analysis yielded a two-factor measurement structure of the Perceived Empathic and Social Self-Efficacy Scale, which was positively associated with insight, social support, and life satisfaction. The Perceived Empathic and Social Self-Efficacy Scale is a useful measure to assess social skills amongst individuals with SMI in rehabilitation counselling.",65
"Background: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) with a frontal presentation, characterized by cognitive deficits and behavioral changes, has been recognized as an early clinical picture, distinct from the classical so-called Richardson and parkinsonism presentations. The midcingulate cortex is associated with executive and attention tasks and has consistently been found to be impaired in imaging studies of patients with PSP. The aim of the present study was to determine alterations in neurotransmission underlying the pathophysiology of PSP, as well as their significance for clinically identifiable PSP subgroups. Methods: In vitro receptor autoradiography was used to quantify densities of 20 different receptors in the caudate nucleus and midcingulate area 24' of patients with PSP (n = 16) and age-and sex-matched control subjects (n = 14). Results: Densities of.-aminobutyric acid type B, peripheral benzodiazepine, serotonin receptor type 2, and Nmethyl-D-aspartate receptors were significantly higher in area 24' of patients with PSP, where tau impairment was stronger than in the caudate nucleus. Kainate and nicotinic cholinergic receptor densities were significantly lower, and adenosine receptor type 1 (A1) receptors significantly higher, in the caudate nucleus of patients with PSP. Receptor fingerprints also segregated PSP subgroups when clinical parameters such as occurrence of frontal presentation and tau pathology severity were taken into consideration. Conclusions: We demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, that kainate and A1 receptors are altered in PSP and that clinically identifiable PSP subgroups differ at the neurochemical level. Numerous receptors were altered in the midcingulate cortex, further suggesting that it may prove to be a key region in PSP. Finally, we add to the evidence that nondopaminergic systems play a role in the pathophysiology of PSP, thus highlighting potential novel treatment strategies.",119
"Human identification at a distance has recently become a hot research topic in the fields of computer vision and pattern recognition. Since gait patterns can operate from a distance without subject cooperation, gait recognition has most widely been studied to address this problem. In this paper, a subspace ensemble learning using totally-corrective boosting (SEL_TCB) framework and its kernel extension are proposed for gait recognition. In this framework, multiple subspaces are iteratively learned with different weight distributions on the triplet set using totally-corrective technology, in order to preserve the proximity relationships among instance triplets. Further, we extend the SEL_TCB framework to the kernel SEL_TCB (KSEL_TCB) framework which can deal with the nonlinear manifold of data. We compare our method with the recently published gait recognition approaches on USF HumanID Database. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves highly competitive performance against the state-of-the-art gait recognition approaches.",0
"Little is known about how the virulence of a human pathogen varies in the environment it shares with its vector. This study focused on whether the virulence of Trypanosoma cruzi (Trypanosomatida: Trypanosomatidae), the causal agent of Chagas' disease, is related to altitude. Accordingly, Triatoma dimidiata (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) specimens were collected at three different altitudes (300, 700 and 1400 m a. s. l.) in Chiapas, Mexico. The parasite was then isolated to infect uninfected T. dimidiata from the same altitudes, as well as female CD-1 mice. The response variables were phenoloxidase (PO) activity, a key insect immune response, parasitaemia in mice, and amastigote numbers in the heart, oesophagus, gastrocnemius and brain of the rodents. The highest levels of PO activity, parasitaemia and amastigotes were found for Tryp. cruzi isolates sourced from 700 m a. s. l., particularly in the mouse brain. A polymerase chain reaction-based analysis indicated that all Tryp. cruzi isolates belonged to a Tryp. cruzi I lineage. Thus, Tryp. cruzi from 700 m a. s. l. may be more dangerous than sources at other altitudes. At this altitude, T. dimidiata is more common, apparently because the conditions are more beneficial to its development.

"Environmental pollution caused by inert anthropogenic stressors such as microplastics in aquatic media is constantly increasing. Through the proliferating use of plastic products in daily life, more and more plastic particles enter waters as primary microplastics. Even though large scale plastic items such as plastic bottles and bags represent the highest percentage of plastic waste, their degeneration also generates microparticles and nanoparticles (secondary microplastics). Modern sewage treatment plants require innovative ideas in order to deal with this man-made problem. State-of-the-art technology offers approaches to minimise the amount of microplastics in aquatic systems. These technologies, however, are either insufficient or very costly, as well as time-consuming in both cases. The conceptual idea presented here is to apply innovative inorganic-organic hybrid silica gels which provide a cost-effective and straightforward approach. Currently, the synthesis of preorganised bioinspired compounds is advancing in order to produce functionalised hybrid silica gels in a further step. These gels have the ability to remove stressors such as microplastics from waste water. By means of the sol-gel process, bioinspired silane compounds are currently being permuted to macromolecules and examined with respect to their properties as fixation and filter material in order to remove the hydrophobic anthropogenic stressors sustainably. Here, the reproduction of biological systems plays a significant role. In particular in material sciences, this approach is becoming increasingly important. Among other concepts, new biomimetic molecules form the basis for the investigation of innovative host-guest relationships for anthropogenic stressors in the environment and their implementation in technical processes.",96
"Introduction: Biologic antagonists to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) are effective medications and have become well established in the treatment of both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Biosimilar medications, which are medications deemed to be equivalent to reference biologic products in terms of clinical effectiveness, safety, pharmacokinetic analysis, and immunogenicity, have now been approved in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) based on indication exploration from clinical data in alternate disease states. Clinicians use these products with caution secondary to lack of clinical experience. Areas Covered: The authors performed a literature search using the following keywords: CT-P13, biosimilar, adalimumab, infliximab, ABP 501, and inflammatory bowel disease. Bibliographies were also reviewed for pertinent articles. Articles pertaining to the clinical efficacy of biosimilars in IBD were included. Expert commentary: The phase 3 trials, which provided the clinical justification to bring TNF-alpha biosimilars to market, were in rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis; however, new clinical data suggests that biosimilar products have equivalent safety and efficacy to reference products in IBD. This has led to an increased acceptance amongst practicing gastroenterologists and a potential reduction in healthcare costs.",107
"Antisocial personality disorder (APD) and psychopathy have been extensively researched in relationship to criminal behavior and aggression. Comparatively few studies have evaluated these clinical constructs for subtypes of aggression, specifically reactive and instrumental aggression. Moreover, published studies tend to focus on extremes, either prisoners in maximum-security facilities or college samples. The current study utilized jail detainees on a minimum-security unit to retrospectively examine their self-reported reactive and instrumental aggression. Because conduct disorder (CD) is required for APD, the combined APD-CD symptomatology was used to predict subtypes of aggression. As a comparative analysis, facet scores on the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised were also used as predictors. Results of the current study have implications for forensic practice by utilizing aggression as a multi-dimensional construct in conjunction with personality traits (e.g., facets of psychopathy) in risk assessments.",73
"Mayas, having experienced genocide, exile, and severe poverty, are at high risk for the consequences of cumulative trauma that continually resurfaces through current fear of an uncertain future. Little is known about the mental health and alcohol use status of this population. This correlational study explored t/he relationship of cumulative trauma as it relates to social determinants of health (years in the United States, education, health insurance status, marital status, and employment), psychological health (depression symptoms), and health behaviors (alcohol use) of 102 Guatemalan Mayas living in Southeast Florida. The results of this study indicated that, as specific social determinants of health and cumulative trauma increased, depression symptoms (particularly among women) and the risk for harmful alcohol use (particularly among men) increased. Identifying risk factors at an early stage before serious disease or problems are manifest provides room for early screening leading to early identification, early treatment, and better outcomes.",69
"Animal hairs existing broadly in nature are found to be effectively responsive to stimuli of heat and water in sequence for shape deformation and recovery, namely, coupled shape memory function (CSMF). In the paper, the ability of thermo-water sensitive CSMF was first time investigated for animal hairs, the structural and molecular networks for net-points and switches were therefrom identified. Experimentally, animal hair manifested a high ability of shape fixation in thermal processing and good shape recovery by water stimulus. Characterizations of two stimuli (heating and hydration) were performed systematically on hair's deformation, recovery, viscoelasticity and chemical components (crystalline phase, key bonds inamorphous area). The variations of related chemical components in molecular networks were also explored. A hybrid structural network model was thereafter proposed to interpret the thermo-water sensitive CSMF of hair. This study of two-sequential-stimuli CSMF is original and inspired to explore more complex functions of other smart natural materials and expected to make much smarter synthetic polymers.",103

"This article aims at introducing the first steps of development and validation of a CFD tool dedicated to realistic tidal turbine farm modelling. The fluid solver is presented in details, together with the actuator disc model used to represent tidal turbines. A particular attention is paid to the spatial scheme in order to limit the numerical diffusion in the wakes. Comparisons with experimental results from Mycek et al. [1] on a horizontal axis tidal turbine (HATT) are presented and discussed. For the different cases, averaged axial velocities and averaged turbulence intensity rates are compared from 1.2 to 10 tidal turbine diameters behind the device. The properties of this tool are discussed in terms of accuracy, CPU costs and applicability to industrial purpose. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",80
"Background: Research among people who inject drugs (PWIDs) in the USA and Mexico has identified a range of adverse health impacts associated with policing of PWIDs. We employed a mixed methods design to investigate how PWIDs from San Diego and Mexico experienced policing in Tijuana, and how these interactions affect PWIDs behavior, stratifying by country of origin. Methods: In 2012-2014,575 PWIDs in San Diego, 102 of whom had used drugs in Mexico in the past six months, were enrolled in the STAHR-II study, with qualitative interviews conducted with a subsample of 20 who had recently injected drugs in Mexico. During this period, 735 PWIDs in Tijuana were also enrolled in the El Cuete-IV study, with qualitative interviews conducted with a subsample of 20 recently stopped by police. We calculated descriptive statistics for quantitative variables and conducted thematic analysis of qualitative transcripts. Integration of these data involved comparing frequencies across cohorts and using qualitative themes to explain and explore findings. Results: Sixty-one percent of San Diego-based participants had been recently stopped by law enforcement officers (LEOs) in Mexico; 53% reported it was somewhat or very likely that they would be arrested while in Mexico because they look like a drug user. Ninety percent of Tijuana-based participants had been recently stopped by LEOs; 84% reported it was somewhat or very likely they could get arrested because they look like a drug user. Participants in both cohorts described bribery and targeting by LEOs in Mexico. However, most San Diego-based participants described compliance with bribery as a safeguard against arrest and detention, with mistreatment being rare. Tijuana-based participants described being routinely targeted by LEOs, were frequently detained, and reported instances of sexual and physical violence. Tijuana-based participants described modifying how, where, and with whom they injected drugs in response; and experienced feelings of stress, anxiety, and powerlessness. This was less common among San Diego based participants, who mostly attempted to avoid contact with LEOs in Mexico while engaging in risky injection behavior. Conclusion: Experiences of discrimination and stigma were reported by a larger proportion of PWIDs living in Mexico, suggesting that they may be subject to greater health harms related to policing practices compared with those residing in the USA. Our findings reinforce the importance of efforts to curb abuse and align policing practices with public health goals in both the US and Mexico. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",61
"We have been studying and developing a new television system based on a methodology which delivers text-based scripts through the Internet representing visual contents instead of transmitting visual content in a format of video data. Such a Text-Generated TV System is achieved by the technology called TVML (TV program Making Language) enabling to create TV-program-like computer graphics animation automatically from script. One of the problems in our development is how to establish the scheme of TV program production with TVML to get quality contents like in a real TV broadcast. Our approach to the problem is to analyze the real TV program and to mimic it with TVML. We first choose a reference TV program then analyze it in many aspects. Based on the acquired knowledge, we then transfer those findings to CG production made using TVML to make a copy of the original TV show as faithful as possible. The objective of the attempt is to reveal the essential elements which would be needed to obtain a full-CG TV program with quality. In this paper, we describe the mimicking process of the news show, the result of the TVML production with a comparison to the original and the evaluation result that we conducted with testers. Finally, we discuss the pros and cons of the CG production applied to produce news show and have shed light on the problems.",79
"Similarity join on XML documents which are usually modeled as rooted ordered labeled trees is widely applied, due to the ambiguity of references to the real-world objects. The conventional method dealing with this issue is based on tree edit distance, which is shortage of flexibility and efficiency. In this paper, we propose two novel edit operations together with extended tree edit distance, which can achieve good performance in similarity matching with hierarchical data structures [the run-time is in the worst case]. And then, we propose -generation set distance as a good approximation of the tree edit distance to further improve the join efficiency with quadric time complexity. Experiments on real and synthetic databases demonstrate the benefit of our method in efficiency and scalability.",41
"Human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs) have been shown to possess potent immunomodulatory properties across a number of disease models. Recently, we reported that hAECs influence macrophage polarization and activity, and that this step was dependent on regulatory T cells. In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of hAEC-derived proresolution lipoxin-A(4) (LXA4) on T-cell, macrophage, and neutrophil phenotype and function during the acute phase of bleomycin-induced lung injury. Using C57Bl6 mice, we administered 4 million hAECs intraperitoneally 24 hours after bleomycin challenge. Outcomes were measured at days 3, 5, and 7. hAEC administration resulted in significant changes to T-cell, macrophage, dendritic cell, and monocyte/macrophage infiltration and phenotypes. Endogenous levels of lipoxygenases, LXA4, and the lipoxin receptor FPR2 were elevated in hAEC-treated animals. Furthermore, we showed that the effects of hAECs on macrophage phagocytic activity and T-cell suppression are LXA4 dependent, whereas the inhibition of neutrophil-derived myleoperoxidase by hAECs is independent of LXA4. This study provides the first evidence that lipid-based mediators contribute to the immunomodulatory effects of hAECs and further supports the growing body of evidence that LXA4 is proresolutionary in lung injury. This discovery of LXA4-dependent communication between hAECs, macrophages, T cells, and neutrophils is important to the understanding of hAEC biodynamics and would be expected to inform future clinical applications.",3
"The mechanical response of a wire strand is inherently complex because the helical wires undergo evolving stress and contact conditions as the strand is loaded. Further complications are added to the strand behavior if one or more of the wires break due to strand degradation over time. Although a detailed investigation on strand behavior is critically important for predicting the capacity of a broken strand as well as developing new monitoring approaches for wire break detection, there is little study available in the literature on wire breakage in a stressed strand. This paper provides an extensive investigation on stressing and post-breakage dynamic behavior of a prestressing strand. A finite element model is generally useful to study the global strand response, along with many localized phenomena that have strong influence on its performance, but are difficult to capture either experimentally or through closed-form analytical models. Investigations on certain behaviors, such as wire breaks, however, require a relatively large or even a full-scale model to adequately develop contact and frictional conditions. Moreover, such a sizeable model can account for any deviation points and may avoid edge effects. Consequently, several finite element parameters, such as the load ramp profile and duration, effects of damping and interwire friction, become critical for an accurate and efficient model. This paper first presents the use of a parametrized model to study strand behavior and evaluates the effects of these modeling parameters on strand response; load distribution and redistribution among the wires at the onset of interwire motion are also considered. The model is then used to simulate wire breakage in a prestressing strand, so that various aspects of post-breakage response can be examined. Numerical results show that a linear load ramp or stressing too quickly may lead to an inaccurate axial tension developed in the strand, whereas the inclusion of nominal mass-based damping has been found effective in achieving a quasi-static solution at a reasonable computational cost. In addition, the wire break simulation results indicate that breakage of an outer wire results in greater prestress loss than breakage of the center wire, which might have important implications for non-destructive wire breakage detection.

"Measuring or estimating the number of errors in (i.e., violations to) a functional dependency (FD) offers valuable information about data semantics and quality. Most existing work focuses on FD error estimation in a centralized environment, where data are stored only in one site and the goal is to optimize the time and space complexities of the estimation algorithms. The distributed FD error estimation problem, in which the data can reside in multiple physically distributed sites, has never been studied in depth and is the subject of this work. In this work, we study a version of the distributed FD error estimation problem where a coordinator site communicates with multiple remote sites for arriving at such estimations, and the goal is to minimize this communication cost. We study two types of queries-that are dual to each other in semantics-for such estimations: one tries to maximize the accuracies of FD error estimations under fixed communication costs, and the other to minimize the communication costs needed to meet certain accuracy requirements. In our framework, each remote site maintains a concise synopsis data structure obtained by scanning its local data once, and the coordinator site receives and processes all such data structures to arrive at an estimate of the FD error. Our solution extends from the case of two remote sites to that of multiple remote sites. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed techniques via rigorous analysis and extensive experiments.

"Rock-detention structures are used as restoration treatments to engineer ephemeral stream channels of southeast Arizona, USA, to reduce streamflow velocity, limit erosion, retain sediment, and promote surface-water infiltration. Structures are intended to aggrade incised stream channels, yet little quantified evidence of efficacy is available. The goal of this 3-year study was to characterize the geomorphic impacts of rock-detention structures used as a restoration strategy and develop a methodology to predict the associated changes. We studied reaches of two ephemeral streams with different watershed management histories: one where thousands of loose-rock check dams were installed 30 years prior to our study, and one with structures constructed at the beginning of our study. The methods used included runoff, sediment transport, and geomorphic modelling and repeat terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) surveys to map landscape change. Where discharge data were not available, event-based runoff was estimated using KINEROS2, a one-dimensional kinematic-wave runoff and erosion model. Discharge measurements and estimates were used as input to a two-dimensional unsteady flow-and-sedimentation model (Nays2DH) that combined a gridded flow, transport, and bed and bank simulation with geomorphic change. Through comparison of consecutive DEMs, the potential to substitute uncalibrated models to analyze stream restoration is introduced. We demonstrate a new approach to assess hydraulics and associated patterns of aggradation and degradation resulting from the construction of check-dams and other transverse structures. Notably, we find that stream restoration using rock-detention structures is effective across vastly different timescales. Published by Elsevier B.V.",83
"This study had the aim to identify and relat the occurrence of billfish larvae and eggs in the Southeastern coast of Brazil. During the summer in two seasons (2012/2013 and 2013/2014) 74 surface trawls were done using an ichthyoplankton net off the coast of Vitoria-ES, Rio de Janeiro-RJ and Ilhabela-SP and 391 fish larvae were collected. The identification of the billfish larvae was done by molecular biology using the DNA barcode (COI gene). During the 2012/2013 season, five sailfish and two white marlin larvae were identified and in the 2013/2014 season, two sailfishes, two white marlin larvae and two swordfish eggs were identified. The occurrence of billfish larvae shall be further studied, so that inferences about the area and period of spawning and development of early life stages of these fish can be made more accurately.",30
"Fc-fusion proteins are an important new class of biotherapeutics; however, there is currently little published data on the behavior of these proteins in downstream processing operations. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ultrafiltration behavior of a highly purified Fe-fusion protein in both citrate/phosphate and histidine buffers over a wide range of protein concentrations. Filtrate flux data were obtained using a Pellicon 3 tangential flow filtration cassette. Results were analyzed using a modified version of a recently developed ultrafiltration model that accounts for the effects of intermolecular interactions on protein mass transfer, suitably extended to include the flux in the pressure-dependent regime. The key parameters in this model were evaluated from independent measurements of the solution viscosity and osmotic pressure for protein concentrations up to 200 g/L. The filtrate flux and maximum achievable protein concentration in the histidine buffer were both significantly lower than the corresponding values in the citrate/phosphate buffer due primarily to the greater viscosity in the histidine buffer. The modified concentration polarization model was in good agreement with filtrate flux data over the full range of protein concentrations in both the pressure-dependent and pressure-independent regime. These results provide important insights into the factors controlling the ultrafiltration behavior of the Fe-fusion protein.",23
"Introduction: this article is the result of the research ""Controllers in simulation of investigation not associated to an institutional project"" developed in 2012 by the Pontifical Bolivarian University in Medellin, Colombia. It describes the development of a temperature control system in a scaled prototype of a small cavity; analyzes the control method in simulation and demonstrates how to implement the algorithm in a microcontroller dspic using state space representation and power control per stage. Methodology: a static and dynamic analysis of the system is performed and the procedure is described to locate the parameters of the model. Results: they are presented graphically, using data obtained both in the simulation as in the physical implementation of the prototype. In the data is observed the behavior of the control system when confronted with changing temperature references and disturbances. Each of the improvements made to the control system enhances the expected answer, so that it reaches a stable state in approximately 4 minutes, when using the controller pid and the open control loop. Conclusions: the second order model selected for the system's dynamic model has good precision and follows approximately the same form as the experimental dynamic curve. The controlled system takes about 4 minutes to reach a stable state when using the pid and the open control loop.",51
"In this paper, we propose a communication support tool for understanding emotion in an unstable narrowband network. The tool can reflect some emotion with a selected voice to character-based real time communication such as chat. The voice data is transmitted asynchronously and stored in local storage. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of communication to play voice data according to emotion, we implemented web-based voice contents classified according to some massage types and primitive emotion.",64
"Background Traditionally, engineering curricula about electrical circuits use textbook instruction and hands-on lessons, which are effective approaches for teaching terms and definitions, the procedural use of formulas, and how to build circuits. Nonetheless, students often lack conceptual understanding. Purpose (Hypothesis) The aim of this study was to discover how to facilitate the acquisition of conceptual understanding. We hypothesized that adding an instructional approach in the form of inquiry learning in a virtual lab would be more effective than relying on traditional instruction alone. Design/Method Students in secondary vocational engineering education were randomly assigned to one of two conditions in a quasi-experimental study. In the traditional condition, the curriculum was supplemented with computer-based practice. In the virtual lab condition, the traditional curriculum was supplemented with inquiry learning in a virtual lab. Results Results showed that students in the virtual lab condition scored significantly higher on conceptual understanding (Cohen's d = 0.65) and on procedural skills (d = 0.76). In particular, students in this condition scored higher (d = 1.19) on solving complex problems. This result occurred for both complex conceptual and procedural problems. Conclusion Since students in the virtual lab condition acquired better conceptual understanding and also developed better procedural skills than students in the traditional condition, it appears that conceptual understanding and procedural skills develop in an iterative fashion.",45

"Most of the previously proposed schemes use temporary identities for mobile users to provide unlinkable anonymous authentication for mobile users to the satellite network control center (NCC), where the temporary identities are picked at random after each session and agreed between a mobile user U and the NCC for the next session. Although such schemes provide full anonymity and are computationally efficient, the common problem with such strategies is that an adversary is able to desynchronize the temporary identity shared between U and NCC by means of simple jamming attack at a certain round in the authentication protocol. It results in the denial of all future sessions unless U re-registers a new identity at the NCC. In this paper, we propose a new authentication scheme for mobile satellite networks. We avoid using synchronized temporary identities, which are always vulnerable to desynchronization attacks. We also avoid multi-round authentication phase in order to reduce the jamming effect. Instead, a mobile user is able to create a new blinded version of his clear identity for each established session noninteractively, allowing him to anonymously authenticate himself to NCC in a fully unlinkable fashion. Moreover, in few milliseconds and one move non-interactive way, U is able to establish a session key with NCC in a fully anonymous and authenticated way. Our new scheme uses recent advances in elliptic curve cryptography, and hence, it is efficient for implementation on mobile devices with limited resources. Through the rigorous security analysis using the broadly accepted Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic, informal security analysis, and the simulation for formal security verification using the widely known automated validation of Internet security protocols and sapplications tool, we show that our scheme is secure against various known attacks.

"The present study examined how levels of construal affect retrieval-induced forgetting. Higher-level construal is associated with the focus on the similarities among stimuli, suggesting that high-level construal promotes relational processing. Based on this fact, retrieval-induced forgetting may be reduced or eliminated under high-level construal condition because of the effect of relational processing. Two experiments were conducted using a retrieval-practice paradigm with different stimuli while priming the level of construal. A meta-analysis synthesizing the results showed that retrieval-induced forgetting occurred under the low-level construal condition, whereas forgetting did not occur under the high-level construal condition. These results suggest that abstract thinking can eliminate retrieval-induced forgetting because of relational processing, demonstrating the role of the levels of construal on memory inhibition.",78
"Background: A vast diversity of microbes colonizes in the human gastrointestinal tract, referred to intestinal microbiota. Microbiota and products thereof are indispensable for shaping the development and function of host innate immune system, thereby exerting multifaceted impacts in gut health. Methods: This paper reviews the effects on immunity of gut microbe-derived nucleic acids, and gut microbial metabolites, as well as the involvement of commensals in the gut homeostasis. We focus on the recent findings with an intention to illuminate the mechanisms by which the microbiota and products thereof are interacting with host immunity, as well as to scrutinize imbalanced gut microbiota (dysbiosis) which lead to autoimmune disorders including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Type 1 diabetes (T1D) and systemic immune syndromes such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Results: In addition to their well-recognized benefits in the gut such as occupation of ecological niches and competition with pathogens, commensal bacteria have been shown to strengthen the gut barrier and to exert immunomodulatory actions within the gut and beyond. It has been realized that impaired intestinal microbiota not only contribute to gut diseases but also are inextricably linked to metabolic disorders and even brain dysfunction. Conclusions: A better understanding of the mutual interactions of the microbiota and host immune system, would shed light on our endeavors of disease prevention and broaden the path to our discovery of immune intervention targets for disease treatment.",4
"Xp11 translocation renal cell carcinomas (RCC) are characterized by several different translocations involving the TFE3 gene. Tumors with different specific gene fusions may have different clinicopathologic manifestations. Only 3 RBM10TFE3 RCCs have been reported to date. Here, we added 4 cases of this rare type of tumors with clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, molecular, and ultrastructural analyses. Most tumors had similar patterns with mixed architectures as follows: acinar, tubular and papillary patterns of epithelioid cells combined with sheets of small cells with ""pseudorosettelike"" architectures, mimicking the typical morphology of t(6;11) RCC. Cytoplasmic vacuolization, nuclear groove, and psammoma bodies were observed in most cases. Immunohistochemically, all 4 cases demonstrated moderate to strong immunoreactivity for TFE3, Cathepsin K, CD10, Ksp-cadherin, E-cadherin, P504S, RCC marker, PAX8 and vimentin, whereas negativity for TFEB, HMB45, and CK7. CKpan and Melan-A were at least focally expressed. The antibody to Ki-67 showed labeling of 3% to 8% (mean, 5%) of tumor cell nuclei. ;Of interest, several immunostainings demonstrated expression discrepancy in different histology patterns. RBM10-TFE3 fusion transcripts were identified in all cases by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, all 4 cases showed unusual split signals with a distance <1 signal diameter (co-localized or subtle split signals) and usually had false-negative results. We also observed ultrastructures, including melanin pigment, nuclear groove, numerous glycogens, mitochondrion with areas of high electron density material, basement membrane material, and cell junctions with poor development. All 4 patients were alive with no evidence of recurrent disease. Our report adds to the known data regarding RBM10-TFE3 RCC.",37
"Based on a grid concept of an interactive hybrid online laboratory we will describe different fields of applications in different learning scenarios.

"Previous studies have examined the neural correlates of emotion regulation and the neural changes that are evoked bymusic exposure. However, the link between music and emotion regulation is poorly understood. The objectives of this review are to (1) synthesize what is known about the neural correlates of emotion regulation and music-evoked emotions, and (2) consider the possibility of therapeutic effects of music on emotion dysregulation. Music-evoked emotions can modulate activities in both cortical and subcortical systems, and across cortical-subcortical networks. Functions within these networks are integral to generation and regulation of emotions. Since dysfunction in these networks are observed in numerous psychiatric disorders, a better understanding of neural correlates of music exposure may lead to more systematic and effective use of music therapy in emotion dysregulation.",70
"The HIV-AIDS epidemic has provided one of the more challenging problems in treatment of infectious diseases. As antiretroviral drugs made a very marked improvement in controlling the immunodeficiency state and patients gained in their longevity, the concern with lipid abnormalities came to the fore. The initial drugs produced a form of metabolic syndrome accompanied by very elevated plasma triglyceride concentrations. Furthermore, the drugs used to control the virus were often metabolized in a manner that interfered with lipid lowering drug therapy. The antiviral agents have improved in many respects and the experience in managing the lipid disorders has added greatly to our ability to control these problems as well. This roundtable discussion has been conducted with 4 physicians who have been involved in management of large cohorts of patients with HIV infection and who have had a special interest in reduction of vascular disease risk.

"This report describes the case of a 10-month-old infant, who was delivered to our hospital by the emergency physician intubated and in an unclear unconscious state. The father reported that the child had fallen from the couch to the ground. The consulted ophthalmologist reported venous stasis in both eyes including intraretinal and preretinal bleeding in all four quadrants, a diffuse vitreous hemorrhage in the right eye and temporal retinal wrinkling in both eyes. Based on these particular clinical findings a shaken baby syndrome was suspected. This report demonstrates the importance of recognizing and correctly interpreting the typical ophthalmological signs of physical child abuse in order to detect and prevent further mistreatment of children; moreover, the increasing importance of photographic documentation and histological work-up of the findings for forensic reasons are emphasized.",76
"Objective: Prisoners are at increased risk of both self-harm and suicide compared with the general population, and the risk of suicide after release from prison is three times greater than for those still incarcerated. However, surprisingly little is known about the incidence of self-harm following release from prison. We aimed to determine the incidence of, identify risk factors for and characterise emergency department presentations resulting from self-harm in adults after release from prison. Method: Cohort study of 1325 adults interviewed prior to release from prison, linked prospectively with State correctional and emergency department records. Data from all emergency department presentations resulting from self-harm were secondarily coded to characterise these presentations. We used negative binomial regression to identify independent predictors of such presentations. Results: During 3192 person-years of follow-up (median 2.6years per participant), there were 3755 emergency department presentations. In all, 83 (6.4%) participants presented due to self-harm, accounting for 165 (4.4%) presentations. The crude incidence rates of self-harm for males and females were 49.2 (95% confidence interval: [41.2, 58.7]) and 60.5 (95% confidence interval: [44.9, 81.6]) per 1000 person-years, respectively. Presenting due to self-harm was associated with being Indigenous (incidence rate ratio: 2.01; 95% confidence interval: [1.11, 3.62]), having a lifetime history of a mental disorder (incidence rate ratio: 2.13; 95% confidence interval: [1.19, 3.82]), having previously been hospitalised for psychiatric treatment (incidence rate ratio: 2.68; 95% confidence interval: [1.40, 5.14]) and having previously presented due to self-harm (incidence rate ratio: 3.91; 95% confidence interval: [1.85, 8.30]). Conclusion: Following release from prison, one in 15 ex-prisoners presented to an emergency department due to self-harm, within an average of 2.6years of release. Demographic and mental health variables help to identify at-risk groups, and such presentations could provide opportunities for suicide prevention in this population. Transition from prison to the community is challenging, particularly for those with a history of mental disorder; mental health support during and after release may reduce the risk of adverse outcomes, including self-harm.",70
"Green eco-friendly housing includes approaches to reduce indoor air pollutant sources and to increase energy efficiency. Although sealing/tightening buildings can save energy and reduce the penetration of outdoor pollutants, an adverse outcome can be increased buildup of pollutants with indoor sources. The objective of this study was to determine the differences in the indoor air quality (IAQ) between green and non-green homes in low-income housing complexes. In one housing complex, apartments were renovated using green principles (n = 28). Home visits were conducted immediately after the renovation, and subsequently at 6 months and at 12 months following the renovation. Of these homes, eight homes had pre-renovation home visits; this allowed pre- and post-renovation comparisons within the same homes. Parallel visits were conducted in non-green (control) apartments (n = 14) in a nearby low-income housing complex. The IAQ assessments included PM2.5, black carbon, ultrafine particles, sulfur, total volatile organic compounds (VOCs), formaldehyde, and air exchange rate. Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models. None of the indoor pollutant concentrations were significantly different between green and non-green homes. However, we found differences when comparing the concentrations before and after renovation. Measured immediately after renovation, indoor black carbon concentrations were significantly lower averaging 682 ng/m(3) in post-renovation vs. 2364 ng/m(3) in pre-renovation home visits (p = 0.01). In contrast, formaldehyde concentrations were significantly higher in post-renovated (0.03 ppm) than in pre-renovated homes (0.01 ppm) (p = 0.004). Questionnaire data showed that opening of windows occurred less frequently in homes immediately post-renovation compared to pre-renovation; this factor likely affected the levels of indoor black carbon (from outdoor sources) and formaldehyde (from indoor sources) more than the renovation status itself. To reduce IAQ problems and potentially improve health, careful selection of indoor building materials and ensuring sufficient ventilation are important for green building designs.

"Identifying genes and pathways that contribute to differences in neurobehavioural traits is a key goal in psychiatric research. Despite considerable success in identifying quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with behaviour in laboratory rodents, pinpointing the causal variants and genes is more challenging. For a long time, the main obstacle was the size of QTLs, which could encompass tens if not hundreds of genes. However, recent studies have exploited mouse and rat resources that allow mapping of phenotypes to narrow intervals, encompassing only a few genes. Here, we review these studies, showcase the rodent resources they have used and highlight the insights into neurobehavioural traits provided to date. We discuss what we see as the biggest challenge in the field-translating QTLs into biological knowledge by experimentally validating and functionally characterizing candidate genes-and propose that the CRISPR/Cas genome-editing system holds the key to overcoming this obstacle. Finally, we challenge traditional views on inbred versus outbred resources in the light of recent resource and technology developments.",34
"The role of affect has become increasingly important in ambient intelligence applications. Developers require means for using multiple tools that support emotion detection and interpretation, which can be used jointly to provide meaningful system responses for the user in varied situations. We introduce Vikara, an extensible software platform that provides developers with uniform interfaces and services so their applications can access the results from existing (or newly implemented) tools for emotion sensing and interpretation. Vikara also provides components that make it possible for platform managers to visually monitor affective states as they are sensed by the various available tools. We have experimented with our platform via the development of applications for emotion detection by using (1) the well-known Facial Action Coding System and a Kinect sensor; and (2) a self-reporting interface for Android-based mobile devices. We report on the initial results of using our platform and discuss ambient intelligence scenarios in which we see potential applications, including user experience and usability evaluation, marketing, distance education and inter-personal communication.",92
"Background. Giardiasis, the most common enteric parasitic infection in the United States, causes an estimated 1.2 million episodes of illness annually. Published clinical recommendations include readily available Giardia-specific diagnostic testing and antiparasitic drugs. We investigated sequences of giardiasis diagnostic and treatment events using MarketScan, a large health insurance claims database. Methods. We created a longitudinal cohort of 2995 persons diagnosed with giardiasis (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] code 007.1) from 2006 to 2010, and analyzed claims occurring 90 days before to 90 days after initial diagnosis. We evaluated differences in number and sequence of visits, diagnostic tests, and prescriptions by age group (children 1-17 years, adults 18-64 years) using chi(2) tests and data visualization software. Results. Among 2995 patients (212 433 claims), 18% had a Giardia-specific test followed by or concurrent with an effective antiparasitic drug, without ineffective antibiotics. Almost two-thirds of patients had an antiparasitic and 27% had an antibiotic during the study window. Compared with children, adults more often had >= 3 visits before diagnosis (19% vs 15%; P =.02). Adults were also less likely to have a Giardia-specific diagnostic test (48% vs 58%; P < .001) and more likely to have an antibiotic prescription (28% vs 25%; P = .04). When Giardia-specific tests and antiparasitic and antibiotic prescriptions were examined, pediatric clinical event sequences most frequently began with a Giardia-specific test, whereas adult sequences most frequently began with an antiparasitic prescription. Conclusions. Giardiasis care infrequently follows all aspects of clinical recommendations. Multiple differences between pediatric and adult care, despite age-agnostic recommendations, suggest opportunities for provider education or tailored guidance.",4
"The attributable fraction is a commonly used measure that quantifies the public health impact of an exposure on an outcome. It was originally defined for binary outcomes, but an extension has recently been proposed for right-censored survival time outcomes; the so-called attributable fraction function. A maximum likelihood estimator of the attributable fraction function has been developed, which requires a model for the outcome. In this paper, we derive a doubly robust estimator of the attributable fraction function. This estimator requires one model for the outcome, and one joint model for the exposure and censoring. The estimator is consistent if either model is correct, not necessarily both.",113
"Aging skin is among the most common patient concerns in a facial plastic surgery practice. Ultraviolet (UV)-induced damage expedites the pace of intrinsic aging, resulting in many of the visible signs of aging, such as rough skin texture, pigmentation irregularities, fine and deep wrinkling, and inelasticity. Primary prevention of UV and environmental damage with proper skin care and the use of sunscreen are critical. There is great interest in topically applied products to reverse or delay the visible signs of photoaging. We discuss the most common topically applied agents for photoaging, reviewing their mechanisms and supporting evidence.",114
"Background: This study aimed to determine the frequency of Entamoeba histolytica and Entamoeba dispar infection in school children in the community of Tlaltizapan, in order to understand the dynamics of infection within the school and family spheres of this population. Amoebiasis is an unsolved public health problem and an endemic disease in Mexico. The incidence rate varies depending on the state; the most affected states show the highest numbers of new cases of amoebiasis per year. Previously, we reported the molecular frequency of infection with E. histolytica and/or E. dispar in other rural communities of the state of Morelos. Methods: Children from 3 schools were studied to estimate the frequency of intestinal parasites through microscopic examination of fresh stool samples. The number of studied individuals were 309 school children. The molecular characterization of E. histolytica or E. dispar was carried out by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using species-specific primers to amplify short tandem repeats (STR) in non-coding sequences associated with the tRNA gene; the amplified fragments were sequenced and analyzed. Results: Eight different genotypes were obtained from E. dispar isolates with the molecular marker NKD3-D5. None of the cases in which the species E. histolytica was detected developed symptoms attributable to an invasive process of disease. Moreover, the parasitized condition appeared to have no significant impact on the development or nutritional status of affected children. Genotype 1, which corresponds to the reference strain E. dispar SAW760, considered a non-pathogenic amoeba, was the most prevalent. Conclusions: The comparison of the genotypes of Entamoeba species did not show a correlation between children and their relatives. In this community, the species Entamoeba dispar genotype 1 was the most widespread. Based on the indicators of growth, development and nutrition status, the studied community seems to be reasonably adapted to constant exposure to intestinal parasites, since there were no evidences of a serious impact of the parasitized condition on the children's health.",117
"Introduction Hirschsprung disease (HD) is a congenital bowel innervation disorder that involves several clinical specialties. There is an increasing interest on the topic reflected by the number of annually published items. It is therefore difficult for a single scientist to survey all published items and to gauge their scientific importance or value. Thus, tremendous efforts were made to establish sustainable parameters to evaluate scientific work within the past decades. It was the birth of scientometrics. Materials and Methods To quantify the global research activity in this field, a scientometric analysis was conducted. We analyzed the research output of countries, individual institutions, authors, and their collaborative networks by using the Web of Science database. Density-equalizing maps and network diagrams were employed as state of the art visualization techniques. Results The United States is the leading country in terms of published items (n=685), institutions (n=347), and cooperation (n=112). However, although there is dominance in quantity, the most intensive international networks between authors and institutions are not linked to the United States. By contrast, most of the European countries combine the highest impact of publications. Further analysis reveal the influence of international cooperation and associated phenomena on the research field HD. Conclusion We conclude that the field of HD is constantly progressing. The importance of international cooperation in the scientific community is continuously growing.",34
"This paper addresses the use of Solar Thermal Energy to continuously generate electrical energy with a commercially available Turbo-Charger driving an Electrical Generator. The system is based on Brayton's thermodynamic cycle and the energy is provided by a thermal accumulator. We propose that using air as the working media, the compressor element is capable of producing sufficient boost to achieve a useful level of efficiency for the cycle at the operating speed range claimed by the factory. The design or selection of the other important components of the system, such as the electrical generator, the starting motor, the electrical drive, the rectifying and inverting of the current is discussed. A parametric analysis that proves the theoretical feasibility of this model is included. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",52
"Aims: We investigated the mechanism(s) by which valsartan, a selective antagonist of angiotensin subtype 1 (AT(1)) receptor, decreased plasma glucose in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Methods: The plasma glucose concentration was assessed by the glucose oxidase method. The concentration of beta-endorphin in plasma or medium incubating adrenal medulla was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mRNA levels of the subtype 4 form of glucose transporter (GLUT4) in soleus muscle and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) in the liver were detected by Northern blotting analysis, while the protein levels of GLUT4 in isolated soleus muscle and hepatic PEPCK were investigated using Western blotting analysis. Results: A single intravenous injection of valsartan dose-dependently increased plasma beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (BER) in parallel with the lowering of plasma glucose concentration in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Naloxone and naloxonazine inhibited the plasma glucose-lowering action of valsartan at doses sufficient to block opioid mu-receptors. In contrast to its action in wild-type diabetic mice, valsartan failed to modify plasma glucose in opioid mu-receptor knockout diabetic mice. Bilateral adrenalectomy in STZ-induced diabetic rats eliminated both the plasma glucose-lowering action and the plasma BER-elevating action of valsartan. In the isolated adrenal medulla of STZ-induced diabetic rats, angiotensin II (Ang II) or valsartan did not affect spontaneous BER secretion. Activation of cholinergic receptors by 1.0 mu mol/l acetylcholine (ACh) enhanced BER secretion from the isolated adrenal medulla of STZ-induced diabetic rats, but not in the presence of 1.0 nmol/l Ang II, while valsartan reversed this inhibition by Ang II in a concentration-dependent manner. Treatment of STZ-induced diabetic rats with valsartan (0.2 mg/kg) three times daily for 3 days resulted in an increase in gene expression of GLUT4 in soleus muscle and impeded the reduction of elevated mRNA or protein level of hepatic PEPCK. Both of these effects were blocked by opioid mu-receptor antagonist. Conclusions: The results suggest that blockade of AT(1) receptor by valsartan may enhance the adrenal beta-endorphin secretion induced by ACh, activating the opioid mu-receptors to increase glucose utilization and/or to decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis, resulting in the reduction of plasma glucose in STZ-induced diabetic rats.",38
"Herpes zoster (HZ) infection is a common condition in the elderly. Immunosuppression involving cellular immunity favors its occurrence. The pain is the most frequent complications of HZ. It occurs in about 30% of people aged over 70 years. The virological diagnosis of typical HZ is not useful, and the diagnosis is mainly based on clinical data. Skin care is essential to limit cutaneous damage. Antiviral drugs will reduce the risk of post-herpetic neuralgia, if they are early prescribed within 72 hours after the rash onset. Analgesia is essential and should be conducted in relation evolution. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent the occurrence of HZ complications in the elderly, in particular post-herpetic neuralgia.",114
"Objective: Respiratory illness and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are common debilitating conditions that frequently co-occur. Observational studies indicate that PTSD, independently of smoking, is a major risk and maintenance factor for lower respiratory symptoms (LRS). The current study experimentally tested this etiologic pathway by investigating whether LRS can be reduced by treating PTSD symptoms. Method: Ninety daily smokers exposed to the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster (mean age 50 years, 28% female; 68% White) completed 8-session group-based weekly comprehensive trauma management and smoking cessation treatment that focused on skills to alleviate PTSD symptoms. LRS, PTSD symptoms, and smoking were assessed weekly. Data was analyzed using multilevel models of within-person associations between LRS, PTSD symptoms, smoking, and treatment dose across 8 weekly sessions with concurrent and lagged outcomes. Results: LRS improved significantly with treatment (reduction of .50 standard deviations). Reduction in PTSD symptoms uniquely predicted improvement in LRS at consecutive sessions 1 week apart and fully accounted for the treatment effect on LRS. The effect of PTSD symptoms was stronger than that of smoking, and the only effect to remain significant when both entered the model. Notably, reduction in LRS did not predict future improvement in PTSD symptoms. Conclusions: The results are in line with the etiologic pathway suggesting that PTSD symptoms are a risk and maintenance factor for chronic LRS and that treatment of PTSD can help to alleviate LRS in trauma-exposed populations. PTSD is emerging as a novel and important treatment target for chronic respiratory problems.",26
"Introduction: Unlike other molecular biology studies, the analysis of ancient DNA (aDNA) requires special infrastructure and methodological conditions to guarantee the quality of the results. One of the main authenticity criteria is DNA quantification, where quantitative real-time PCR is often used given its sensitivity and specificity. Nevertheless, the implementation of these conditions and methodologies to fulfill authenticity criteria imply higher costs. Objective: To develop a simple and less costly method for mitochondrial DNA quantification suitable for highly degraded samples. Materials and methods: The proposed method is based on the use of mini-primers for the specific amplification of short fragments of mitochondrial DNA. The subsequent purification of these amplified fragments allows a standard curve to be constructed with concentrations in accordance to the state of degradation of the samples. Results: The proposed method successfully detected DNA from ancient samples including bone remains and mummified tissue. DNA inhibitory substances were also detected. Conclusion: The proposed method represents a simpler and cost-effective way to detect low amounts of aDNA, and a tool to differentiate DNA-free samples from samples with inhibitory substances.",30
"Based on the matching theory, the antecedence of partnership formation between Buyer and Supplier in manufacturing engineering is explored. The results show that strategic level matching and operational level matching are positively associated with partnership formation, and cultural level matching moderates effects of strategic level matching and operational level matching on partnership formation.",84
"We solve a 40-year-old open problem on depth optimality of sorting networks. In 1973, Donald E. Knuth detailed sorting networks of the smallest depth known for n <= 16 inputs, quoting optimality for n <= 8 (Volume 3 of ""The Art of Computer Programming""). In 1989, Parberry proved optimality of networks with 9 <= n <= 10 inputs. We present a general technique for obtaining such results, proving optimality of the remaining open cases of 11 <= n <= 16 inputs. Exploiting symmetry, we construct a small set R-n of two-layer networks such that: if there is a depth-k sorting network on n inputs, then there is one whose first layers are in Rn. For each network in R-n, we construct a propositional formula whose satisfiability is necessary for the existence of a depth-k sorting network. Using an off-the-shelf SAT solver we prove optimality of the sorting networks listed by Knuth. For n <= 10 inputs, our algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than prior ones. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"With the increasing sizes of digital elevation models (DEMs), there is a growing need to design parallel schemes for existing sequential algorithms that identify and fill depressions in raster DEMs. The Priority-Flood algorithm is the fastest sequential algorithm in the literature for depression identification and filling of raster DEMs, but it has had no parallel implementation since it was proposed approximately a decade ago. A parallel Priority-Flood algorithm based on the fastest sequential variant is proposed in this study. The algorithm partitions a DEM into stripes, processes each stripe using the sequential variant in many rounds, and progressively identifies more slope cells that are misidentified as depression cells in previous rounds. Both Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP)- and Message Passing Interface (MPI)-based implementations are presented. The speed-up ratios of the OpenMP-based implementation over the sequential algorithm are greater than four for all tested DEMs with eight computing threads. The mean speed-up ratio of our MPI-based implementation is greater than eight over TauDEM, which is a widely used MPI-based library for hydrologic information extraction. The speed-up ratios of our MPI-based implementation generally become larger with more computing nodes. This study shows that the Priority-Flood algorithm can be implemented in parallel, which makes it an ideal algorithm for depression identification and filling on both single computers and computer clusters.",101
This paper presents a new electronic Vernier fringe counter for the wavelength measurement of a diode laser in a scanning interferometer. The system is intended to be a low cost alternative to commercial systems used for gauge block calibration. The counter stage and phase coincidence detector are made with a microcontroller and high-speed CMOS logic to achieve the required resolution. The microcontroller also can synchronize with other elements to make a fully automated measurement system. This electronic design improves the resolution of the electronic counters in the previous designs.,51
"Background: The incidence of lower extremity injuries in female soccer players is high, but the risk factors for injuries are unknown. Purpose: To investigate risk factors for lower extremity injuries in elite female soccer players. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Players in the Norwegian elite female soccer league (N = 12 teams) participated in baseline screening tests before the 2009 competitive soccer season. The screening included tests assessing maximal lower extremity strength, dynamic balance, knee valgus angles in a drop-jump landing, knee joint laxity, generalized joint laxity, and foot pronation. Also included was a questionnaire to collect information on demographic data, elite-level experience, and injury history. Time-loss injuries and exposure in training and matches were recorded prospectively in the subsequent soccer season using weekly text messaging. Players reporting an injury were contacted to collect data regarding injury circumstances. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for +/- 1 standard deviation of change. Results: In total, 173 players underwent complete screening tests and registration of injuries and exposure throughout the season. A total of 171 injuries in 107 players (62%) were recorded; ligament and muscle injuries were the most frequent. Multivariate analyses showed that a greater body mass index (BMI) (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.21-1.90; P = .001) was the only factor significantly associated with new lower extremity injuries. A greater BMI was associated with new thigh injuries (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.08-2.11; P = .01), a lower knee valgus angle in a drop-jump landing was associated with new ankle injuries (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.41-1.00; P = .04), and a previous knee injury was associated with new lower leg and foot injuries (OR, 3.57; 95% CI, 1.27-9.99; P = .02), whereas none of the factors investigated influenced the risk of new knee injuries. Conclusion: A greater BMI was associated with lower extremity injuries in elite female soccer players. Clinical Relevance: Increased knowledge on risk factors for lower extremity injuries enables more targeted prevention strategies with the aim of reducing injury rates in female soccer players.",27

"We present numerical simulations of a directional coupler based on three-dimensional waveguides made of a nematic liquid crystal, acting as the waveguide core, infiltrated in polydimethysiloxane channels. Modeling is based on the combination of minimization of Oseen-Frank energy of the liquid crystal molecules with a beam propagation algorithm. Design of the coupler waveguides is optimized to minimize coupling lengths and maximise efficiencies. Such components can be made at low cost on flexible plastic substrates and can be also integrated with optofluidic devices for biomedical applications.",35
"Survival following ovarian cancer diagnosis is generally low; understanding factors related to prognosis could be important to optimize treatment. The role of previously diagnosed comorbidities and use of medications for those conditions in relation to prognosis for ovarian cancer patients has not been studied extensively, particularly according to histological subtype. Using pooled data from fifteen studies participating in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium, we examined the associations between history of hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and medications taken for these conditions and overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) among patients diagnosed with invasive epithelial ovarian carcinoma. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for age and stage to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) overall and within strata of histological subtypes. History of diabetes was associated with increased risk of mortality (n = 7,674; HR = 1.12; 95% CI = 1.01-1.25). No significant mortality associations were observed for hypertension (n = 6,482; HR = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.88-1.02) or heart disease (n = 4,252; HR = 1.05; 95% CI = 0.87-1.27). No association of these comorbidities was found with PFS in the overall study population. However, among patients with endometrioid tumors, hypertension was associated with lower risk of progression (n = 339, HR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.35-0.84). Comorbidity was not associated with OS or PFS for any of the other histological subtypes. Ever use of beta blockers, oral antidiabetic medications, and insulin was associated with increased mortality, HR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.03-1.40, HR = 1.28; 95% CI = 1.05-1.55, and HR = 1.63; 95% CI = 1.20-2.20, respectively. Ever use of diuretics was inversely associated with mortality, HR = 0.71; 95% CI = 0.53-0.94. Histories of hypertension, diabetes, and use of diuretics, beta blockers, insulin, and oral antidiabetic medications may influence the survival of ovarian cancer patients. Understanding mechanisms for these observations could provide insight regarding treatment.",129
"Biotechnological production of fatty alcohols, important raw materials in the chemical industry, has been receiving considerable attention in recent years. Fatty alcohols are formed by the reduction of fatty acyl-CoAs or fatty acyl-ACPs catalyzed by a fatty acyl reductase (FAR). In this study, we introduced genes encoding FARs from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtFAR5) and Simmondsia chinensis (ScFAR) into Crambe abyssinica hairy roots via Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated transformation. The efficiency of the transformation ranged between 30 and 45%. The fatty alcohols were only detected in the transgenic hairy root lines expressing ScFAR gene. In all tested lines stearyl alcohol (18:0-OH), arachidyl alcohol (20:0-OH), and behenyl alcohol (22:0-OH) were produced. The content of 18:0-OH varied from 1 to 3% of total fatty acids and fatty alcohols, while the amount of either 20:0-OH and 22:0-OH did not exceed 2%. The transgenic hairy root lines produced from 0.98 to 2.59nmol of fatty alcohols per mg of dry weight. Very low activity of ScFAR was detected in the microsomal fractions isolated from the selected hairy root lines. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the fatty alcohol production in the hairy root cultures. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2017;114: 1275-1282. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",80
"In this study, we develop a novel system to recover the waste heat from the exhaust of a passenger car. A heat exchanger is therefore placed after the exhaust manifold of the vehicle. Thermoelectric generators (TEG) are installed on all pipes of the heat exchanger to generate electricity by the temperature difference between hot and cold sides of the TEG. The heat transfer of the TEG is analyzed numerically. Two configurations of TEG units are investigated for various exhaust flow rates and temperatures. The overall heat transfer rates from the exhaust gas to the TEG, the power capacity of the system and the overall heat transfer coefficients of the system are calculated. It is observed that the power capacity of the system is directly related to the inlet temperature and mass flow rate of the exhaust gas entering the system. The power generated by the system can be improved by 90% with an increase of the mass flow rate and temperature of the exhaust gas. Increasing the size of the TEG system by 66.7% rises the overall heat transfer rate of the system by 33.8%. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",43
"In vitro metabolism of permethrin, a pyrethroid insecticide, was assessed in primary human hepatocytes. In vitro kinetic experiments were performed to estimate the Michaelis-Menten parameters and the clearances or formation rates of the permethrin isomers (cis- and trans-) and three metabolites, cis- and trans-3-(2,2 dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethyl-(1-cyclopropane) carboxylic acid (cis- and trans-DCCA) and 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA). Non-specific binding and the activity of the enzymes involved in permethrin's metabolism (cytochromes P450 and carboxylesterases) were quantified. Trans-permethrin was cleared more rapidly than cis-permethrin with a 2.6-factor (25.7 +/- 0.6 and 10.1 +/- 0.3 mu L/min/10(6) cells respectively). A 3-factor was observed between the formation rates of DCCA and 3-PBA obtained from trans- and cis-permethrin. For both isomers, the rate of formation of DCCA was higher than the one of 3-PBA. The metabolism of the isomers in mixture was also quantified. The co-incubation of isomers at different ratios showed the low inhibitory Potential of cis- and trans-permethrin on each other. The estimates of the clearances and the formation rates in the co-incubation condition did not differ from the estimates obtained with a separate incubation. These metabolic parameters may be integrated in physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models to predict the fate of permethrin and metabolites in the human body. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"Objectives This study aimed to develop a performance assessment tool for the history-taking components of the medical evaluation of physical abuse in young children by (1) determining the consensus-based injury history and social components for documentation, (2) identifying preliminary performance standards, (3) assessing current level-specific performance using the created tools, and (4) evaluating reliability and validity of the created tools. Methods The Physical Abuse Assessment Tool (PHAAT) was developed in 2 steps: (1) a modified Delphi survey was used to identify the injury history and social components for documentation in a medical evaluation for physical abuse, and (2) level-specific (novice, competent, expert) practice standards (minimum passing scores) were created using the identified components via the Angoff method. To evaluate validity, reliability, and level-specific performance of the PHAAT, a chart review of 50 consecutive cases from each of the 3 levels was performed. Results Seventy-one child abuse pediatricians and 39 social workers participated in the modified Delphi survey, and 67 child abuse pediatricians and 27 social workers participated in the Angoff method. The resulting PHAAT included 2 checklists for use based on presence or absence of a history of an injurious event. One-way analysis of variance shows significant differences in performance based on team level (P < 0.001), indicating construct validity. Intrarater and interrater reliability evaluations showed strong (r(s) = 0.64-0.92) and moderate to strong (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.81-0.98) correlations, respectively. Conclusions Initial evaluation suggests the PHAAT may be a reliable and valid practice assessment tool for the medical evaluation of physical abuse.",76
"This work lies within SCALTECH28 project, whose main purpose is to investigate the performance of the 28nm technology in terms of signal processing quality, power consumption, and radiation hardness for applications in instrumentation electronics for particle physics with respect to previous technological generations. An additional target is to experimentally evaluate radiation damage effects on single devices and on full circuits to develop rad-models for simulations. A test chip including elementary device arrays and dedicated read-out circuits has been developed and fully characterized. In particular, a capacitance to frequency converter has been integrated to measure the matching between different capacitors of a programmable array. Experimental results show that matching performance is comparable to previous technologies, making the 28nm technology eligible for analog signal processing in front-end circuits for physical experiments and related data converters. Samples have been sent to irradiation facility for high energy experiments compliance verification.",52
"Background: Disturbances of microcirculation playa significant role in the development and progression of both acute and chronic cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) and may be associated with different hemogram abnormalities. One of the reasons of the prothrombogenic state of the endothelium is the increase in the number of blood corpuscles leading to (non Ph) myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) including essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV), and primary myelofibrosis (PM). Materials and Methods: The study included 167 patients: 102 patients with Ph-MPD and the control group comprising 65 patients with CVD. According to MPD subtype, the patients were divided into three groups: patients with ET (37%, n = 38, male/female 7/31, age 52 +/- 7 years), those with PV (40%, n = 41, male/female 20/21, age 50 +/- 6 years) and those with PM (23%, n = 23, male/female 5/18, age 54 +/- 4 years). Results: In 79% (n = 81) of cases in the study group (with Ph-MPD), patients had chronic CVD, with the most frequently identified symptoms being asthenia (92%) and headache (72%). Headache in Ph-MPD patients was more frequently (86%) associated with PM, while in patients with PV and ET it was equally distributed (70%). Neurological symptoms in 53% of cases were associated with focal changes of the brain on MRI localized in the subcortical area of the frontal and parietal lobes. Twenty-one (21%) patients suffered an acute cerebrovascular accident, 8 of them had thrombotic occlusion of one of the internal carotid arteries leading to hemispheric infarcts. Endothelial function (as measured by flow-dependent dilation of the brachial artery) was severely impaired in all study groups (median 5% with normal cut-off at 10%), the lowest degree of vasodilator activity being specific for patients with a history of stroke (p = 0.011). Conclusion: Patients suffering from MPD had asymptomatic focal changes in the brain in the absence of concomitant vascular disease (hypertension, atherosclerotic vascular disease, heart rhythm disorders) in 50% of cases. MPD, while remaining un- or underdiagnosed, presents a major concern in the cerebrovascular setting. A large number of thrombotic strokes occurring in patients with ET underline the necessity of early diagnostics and preventive therapy in these patients.

"Despite having more similar roles at work and home than ever before, US men and women continue to exhibit different travel behavior. An open question is whether the remaining gender differences in travel differ by traditional and emergent aspects of household structure such as spouse/partner presence, parenthood, and breadwinner status. Using data from the 2003-2010 American Time Use Survey, this study offers a unique, empirical travel time analysis of metropolitan workers stratified by household structure. Results show that gender differences in travel time respond to multiple aspects of household structure in complex and interactive ways. Gender difference in work travel time is only observable when spouse/partner presence and parenthood interact, i.e., in couple households with children. Gender difference in household support travel reacts to parenthood but not spouse/partner presence. Gender difference in travel time between employed females and employed males in single-breadwinner couples is no different from gender difference in double-breadwinner couples. The results call for policy initiatives and research inquiries that pay greater attention to the large gender disparities in work travel in couple households with children and the large gender disparities in household support travel in all households with children including single-parent households. Although incapable of ruling out the influences of internalized gender differences (e.g., preference theory) and gendered structural contexts (e.g., labor market segmentation), the findings provide clear evidence that traditional gender roles and relations remain operative in contemporary households in the US.",77
"Objectives: The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of anxiety, depression and PTSD-related symptoms reported by spouses and close relatives of adult burn survivors. Potential associations between these symptoms and variables such as the severity of the burn were also explored. Method: Participants were spouses (n=31) and close relatives (n=25) of hospitalized patients with acute bums. Anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed by the Hospital Distress Anxiety and Depression Scale and PTSD-related symptoms by the Modified PTSD Symptom Scale at both admission to and discharge from the burn unit. Results: At admission, 77% of spouses and 56% of close relatives of burn patients reported anxiety, depression or PTSD-related symptoms in the clinical range. While spouses had higher scores than close relatives on symptom measures, significant differences were only established for anxiety symptoms (p<.02). A significant effect was found for gender, with women reporting more anxiety (p=.01) and depression (p=.02) symptoms than men. Results also showed a main effect for time, with anxiety (p <.0001), depression (p <.0001) and PTSD-related (p <.0001) symptoms being higher at admission than at discharge. Variables associated with the index patient, such as total body surface area burned, length of stay, number of ventilated days, facial burns, or level of care at admission, were not associated with outcome measures. Conclusions: Spouses and close relatives of burn survivors showed high levels of psychological distress in the first few days following admission, and more than a quarter still reported symptoms in the clinical range at discharge. Our analysis points to the need to offer psychological support and guidance to family members so that they can in turn provide effective support to the burn survivor. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.

"Autologous T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) specific for CD19 have demonstrated remarkable efficacy as therapeutics for B cell malignancies. In the present study, we generated FLAG-tagged CD19-specific CAR-T cells (CD19-FLAG) and compared them to their non-tagged counterparts for their effects on solid and hematological cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. For solid tumors, we used HeLa cervical carcinoma cells engineered to overexpress CD19 (HeLa-CD19), and for hematological cancer we used Raji Burkitt's lymphoma cells, which endogenously express CD19. Like non-tagged CD19 CAR-T cells, CD19-FLAG CAR-T cells expanded in culture >100-fold and exhibited potent cytolytic activity against both HeLa-CD19 and Raji cells in vitro. CD19-FLAG CAR-T cells also secreted significantly more IFN-gamma and IL-2 than the control T cells. In vivo, CD19-FLAG CAR-T cells significantly blocked the growth of HeLa-CD19 solid tumors, increased tumor cleaved caspase-3 levels, and expanded systemically. CD19-FLAG CAR-T cells also significantly reduced Raji tumor burden and extended mouse survival. These results demonstrate the strong efficacy of FLAG-tagged CD19 CAR-T cells in solid and hematological cancer models.",7
"Immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated food allergy and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) are chronic, allergen-mediated disorders characterized by an aberrant TH2 immune response. The development and investigation of biologics for the treatment of IgE-mediated food allergy and eosinophilic esophagitis have provided further insight into the pathophysiology and management of these disorders. This article provides an overview of biologic therapies that are being investigated or have potential as treatments for IgE-mediated food allergy and eosinophilic esophagitis. Identification of EoE phenotypes that are responsive to biologics and investigation of biologics combined with other therapies may help elucidate a role for biologics in EoE.",110
"The role of androgens in cardiovascular disease is still controversial in men. In this study, we investigated metabolic disorders in Tunisian hypogonadal men compared with healthy controls. Forty hypogonadal men and 80 control subjects were enrolled. Patients with a history of pre-existing panhypopituitarism, thyroid dysfunction or inflammatory disease were excluded. Glycaemia, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), lipid profile, insulin, testosterone and gonadotrophins were measured. Insulin resistance was assessed by homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (Homa IR). Waist circumference, body mass index and blood pressure were significantly higher in patients compared with controls. Glycemia, HbA1c, fasting serum insulin and Homa IR were significantly increased among hypogonadal men. In univariate analysis, testosterone levels were inversely correlated with body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure, glycaemia, HbA1C, insulin, Homa IR and hsCRP. In multivariate analysis including all significant variables, initial testosterone level was the only independent risk factor for developing dyslipidaemia. With logistic regression, male hypogonadism was an independent risk factor for MS (P<0.001). We conclude that low testosterone level plays a central role in the development of metabolic syndrome. Further prospective data are required to establish the causative link.",6
"Following the concept of ubiquity further on, Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is focused on technologies and approaches for development of intelligent environments aiming at supporting their users. Architectures of these environments are usually modeled by multi-agent systems, facilitating thus investigation of various processes enabling the environments' functionalities. In this scope, it is challenging to study decision processes used by individual components (agents) of the environment in mutual cooperation for creating decisions about ways how and when to support particular users activities adequately. A recent project DE-PIES ""Decision Processes in Intelligent Environments"", supported by the Czech Scientific Foundation in the period of 2015 to 2017, is oriented on investigation of various decision processes that could appear in various types of intelligent environments, modeled by adequate multi-agent architectures. This paper aims at presenting information about the project goals, its methodology and approaches used as well as intended to be used in near future. A special part of the paper is devoted to possibilities of modeling and simulation of decision processes using the AnyLogic multimethod simulation tool.",92
"The intercalation of L-phenylalanate (LP) into the interlayer gallery of zinc layered hydroxide (ZLH) has been successfully executed using a simple direct reaction method. The synthesised intercalation compound, zinc layered hydroxide-L-phenylalanate (ZLH-LP), was characterised using PXRD, FTIR, CHNS, ICP-OES, TGA/DTG, FESEM and TEM. The PXRD patterns of the intercalation compound demonstrate an intense and symmetrical peak, indicating a well-ordered crystalline layered structure. The appearance of an intercalation peak at a low angle of 20 with a basal spacing of 16.3 A, signifies the successful intercalation of the L-phenylalanate anion into the interlayer gallery of the host. The intercalation is also validated by FTIR spectroscopy and CHNS elemental analysis. Thermogravimetric analysis confirms that the ZLH-LP intercalation compound has higher thermal stability than the pristine L-phenylalanine. The observed percentage of L-phenylalanate accumulated release varies in each release media, with 84.5%, 79.8%, 63.8% and 61.8% release in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution at pH 4.8, deionised water, PBS solution at pH 7.4 and NaCI solution, respectively. The release behaviour of LP from its intercalation compounds in deionised water and PBS solution at pH 4.8 follows pseudo second order, whereas in NaCl solution and PBS solution at pH 7.4, it follows the parabolic diffusion model. This study shows that the synthesised ZLH-LP intercalation compound can be used for the formation of a new generation of materials for targeted drug release with controlled release properties.",69
"Uncertainty in forest information typically results in economic and ecological losses as a consequence of suboptimal management decisions. Several techniques have been proposed to handle such uncertainties. However, these techniques are often complex and costly. Data assimilation (DA) has recently been advocated as a tool that may reduce the uncertainty, thereby improving the quality of forest planning results. It offers an opportunity to make use of all new sources of information in a systematic way and thus provides more accurate and up-to-date information to forest planning. In this study, we refer to literature on handling uncertainties in forest planning, as well as related literature from other scientific fields, to assess the potential benefits of using DA in forest planning. We identify five major potential benefits: (i) the accuracy of the information will be improved; (ii) the information will be kept up to date; (iii) the DA process will provide information with estimated accuracy; (iv) stochastic decision making can be applied whereby the accuracy of the information can be utilized in the decision making process; and (v) DA data allows for the analysis of optimal data acquisition decisions.",94
"Computer-based control systems, especially if they run under general-purpose operating systems, often exhibit variance of the scan period of processing inputs and outputs. Although this fact is usually not taken into account when discrete control algorithms are used, it can cause worse performance of the control loop in comparison to the theoretical case. In this paper we describe a modified discrete LQ control algorithm that takes disturbances of the scan period into account and partially compensates their influence. We also show that such a controller can be implemented even on low-performance hardware platforms, if they are equipped with a sufficient amount of memory.",68
"Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is known for its endocrine disrupting properties. We previously demonstrated that prenatal DEHP exposure is associated with decreased progesterone levels and testosterone/estradiol ratio in the cord blood. However, evidence of the effects of prenatal DEHP exposure on adrenal androgen and glucocorticoids in infants is scarce. Thus, the objectives of this study were to investigate the association between prenatal DEHP exposure and adrenal androgen and glucocorticoids, and to discuss its effects on steroid hormone profiles in infants. This is part of a birth cohort study: The Hokkaido Study on Environment and Children's Health, Sapporo Cohort. Among the 514 participants, 202 mother-infant pairs with available data on maternal mono (2ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), adrenal androgen (dehydroepiandrostenedione [DHEA] and androstenedione) and glucocorticoid (cortisol and cortisone) cord blood levels were included in this study. After adjusting for potential confounders, a linear regression analysis showed that maternal MEHP levels were associated with reduced cortisol and cortisone levels and glucocorticoid/adrenal androgen ratio, whereas increased DHEA levels and DHEA/androstenedione ratio. In a quartile model, when comparing the adjusted least square means in the 4th quartile of MEHP with those in the 1st quartile, cortisol and cortisone levels and glucocorticoid/adrenal androgen ratio decreased, whereas DHEA/androstenedione and cortisol/cortisone ratios increased. Significant p-value trends for cortisol and cortisone levels, cortisol/cortisone ratio, and glucocorticoid/adrenal androgen ratio were observed. In combination with the previous results of reduced progesterone levels and testosterone/estradiol ratio, prenatal exposure to DEHP altered the steroid hormone profiles of infants. Further studies investigating the long-term effects of DEHP exposure on growth, neurodevelopment, and gonad and reproductive function are required. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",117
"Background/Aims: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is present in up to 34% of patients with early-stage Parkinson disease (PD); however, it is difficult to detect subtle impairment without objective cognitive testing. Methods: Data were obtained from the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative. All 341 participants were administered the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and a brief neuropsychological battery. Participants were classified as PD-MCI if MoCA was <26 or if they scored 1 standard deviation below the normative mean in 2 or more domains, based upon established criteria. The sensitivity/specificity for the clinical detection of PD-MCI was determined. Results: Overall accuracy for clinical detection of PD-MCI was 67.4%. Although clinical determination was highly specific (96.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.92-0.98), sensitivity was poor (32.0%; 95% CI: 0.25-0.40). Conclusion: Identifying MCI in early-stage PD based on clinical interview alone appears to be insufficient. The inclusion of objective cognitive tests allowing for normative sample comparisons is needed to increase the detection of cognitive impairment in this population.",119
"The cold-drawn, programmed shape memory polymer (SMP) fibers show excellent stress recovery property, which promotes their application as mechanical actuators in smart material systems. A full understanding of the thermomechanical-damage responses of these fibers is crucial to minimize the trial-and-error manufacturing processes of these material systems. In this work, a multiscale viscoplastic-viscodamage theory is developed to predict the cyclic mechanical responses of SMP fibers. The proposed viscoplastic theory is based on the governing relations for each of the individual microconstituents and establishes the microscale state of the stress and strain in each of the subphases. These microscale fields are then averaged through the micromechanics framework to demonstrate the macroscale constitutive mechanical behavior. The cyclic loss in the functionality of the SMP fibers is interpreted as the damage process herein, and this cyclic loss of stress recovery property is calibrated to identify the state of the damage. The continuum damage mechanics (CDM) together with a thermodynamic consistent viscodamage theory is incorporated to simulate the damage process. The developed coupled viscoplastic-viscodamage theory provides an excellent correlation between the experimental and simulation results. The cyclic loading-damage analysis in this work relies on the underlying physical facts and accounts for the microstructural changes in each of the micro constituents. The established framework provides a well-structured method to capture the cyclic responses of the SMP fibers, which is of utmost importance for designing the SMP fiber-based smart material systems.

"Background: Adolescents and early young adults (AYAs) with cancer are at high risk for poor outcomes. Positive psychological responses such as benefit-finding may buffer the negative impacts of cancer but are poorly understood in this population. Objective: We aimed to prospectively describe the content and trajectory of benefit-and burden-finding among AYAs to develop potential targets for future intervention. Patients and Methods: One-on-one semistructured interviews were conducted with English-speaking AYA patients (aged 14-25 years) within 60 days of diagnosis of a noncentral nervous system malignancy requiring chemotherapy, 6-12 and 12-18 months later. Interviews were coded using directed content analyses with a priori schema defined by existing theoretical frameworks, including changed sense of self, relationships, philosophy of life, and physical well-being. We compared the content, raw counts, and ratios of benefit-to-burden by patient and by time point. Setting/subjects: Seventeen participants at one tertiary academic medical center (mean age 17.1 years, SD = 2.7) with sarcoma (n = 8), acute leukemia (n = 6), and lymphoma (n = 3) completed 44 interviews with >100 hours of transcript-data. Results: Average benefit counts were higher than average burden counts at each time point; 68% of interviews had a benefit-to-burden ratio >1. Positive changed sense-of-self was the most common benefit across all time points (44% of all reported benefits); reports of physical distress were the most common burden (32%). Longitudinal analyses suggested perceptions evolved; participants tended to focus less on physical manifestations and more on personal strengths and life purpose. Conclusions: AYAs with cancer identify more benefits than burdens throughout cancer treatment and demonstrate rapid maturation of perspectives. These findings not only inform communication practices with AYAs but also suggest opportunities for interventions to potentially improve outcomes.",125
"BackgroundInadequate nurse staffing has been reported to lead nurses to omit required nursing care. In South Korea, to reduce informal caregiving by patient families and sitters and to improve the quality of nursing care, a public hospital operated by the Seoul Metropolitan Government has implemented a policy of increasing nurse staffing from 17 patients per registered nurse to 7 patients per registered nurse in 4 out of 13 general nursing units since January 2013. AimThe study aims to compare missed nursing care (omission of required care) in high-staffing (7 patients per nurse) units vs. low-staffing (17 patients per nurse) units to examine the effects of nurse staffing on missed care. MethodsA nurse survey conducted in July 2013 targeted all staff nurses in all four high-staffing and all nine low-staffing units; 115 nurses in the high-staffing units (response rate=94.3%) and 117 nurses in the low-staffing units (response rate=88.6%) participated. Missed nursing care was measured using the MISSCARE survey that included 24 nursing care elements. Nurses were asked how frequently they had missed each element on a 4-point scale from rarely' to always'. ResultsOverall, nurses working in high-staffing units had a significantly lower mean score of missed care than those in low-staffing units. Seven out of 24 nursing care elements were missed significantly less often in high-staffing (vs. low-staffing) units: turning, mouth care, bathing/skin care, patient assessments in each shift, assistance with toileting, feeding and setting up meals. ConclusionThe findings suggest that increasing nurse staffing is associated with a decrease in missed care. Less omission of required nursing care is expected to improve nursing surveillance and patient outcomes, such as patient falls, pressure ulcers and pneumonia. Implications for nursing and health policyAdequate nurse staffing should be ensured to reduce unmet nursing needs and improve patient outcomes.",114
"The TIG process with Hot-Wire addition is described as a process highly productive, in comparison with conventional TIG process with Cold-Wire, achieved large deposition rates and low dilution percentages, characteristics that permit to the process to be an optimum alternative for cladding applications. There are many options of electrical circuits configurations for to heat the addition wire in the TIG Hot-Wire process, highlighting the utilization of the continuous pulsed current and the alternating current. In the present paper were studied two configurations of the electrical circuit for to heat the addition materials, whom in theory provoke different behaviors in the welding arc, and therefore, in the geometrical properties of the welding bead too. A first analysis done on the welding arc, demonstrate that to heat the wire with continuous constant current is generated a permanent magnetic blow over the arc. According to trials made, the direction and intensity of the magnetic blow will depend of the polarity and of the current value for to heat the wire. A macrographic analysis of the weld beads demonstrated that the best results were for the tests made with Hot-Wire, achieving dilutions until a 2% for a wire velocity of 7,5 m/min, 1kW of power for to heat the wire and it using a welding velocity of 30 cm/min.",45
"Background: Intravenous infusion of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP38) provokes migraine attacks in 65-70% of migraine without aura (MO) patients. We investigated whether PACAP38 infusion causes changes in the endogenous production of PACAP38, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), S100 calcium binding protein B (S100B), neuron-specific enolase and pituitary hormones in migraine patients. Methods: We allocated 32 previously genotyped MO patients to receive intravenous infusion PACAP38 (10 pmol/kg/minute) for 20 minutes and recorded migraine-like attacks. Sixteen of the patients were carriers of the risk allele rs2274316 (MEF2D), which confers increased risk of MO and may regulate PACAP38 expression, and 16 were non-carriers. We collected blood samples at baseline and 20, 30, 40, 60 and 90 minutes after the start of the infusion. A control group of six healthy volunteers received intravenous saline. Results: PACAP38 infusion caused significant changes in plasma concentrations of VIP (p = 0.026), prolactin (p = 0.011), S100B (p0.05). There was no difference in the changes of biochemical variables between patients with and without the MEF2D-associated gene variant (p>0.05). Conclusion: PACAP38 infusion elevated the plasma levels of VIP, prolactin, S100B and TSH, but not CGRP and TNF alpha. Development of delayed migraine-like attacks or the presence of the MEF2D gene variant was not associated with preictal changes in plasma levels of neuropeptides, TNF alpha and pituitary hormones.",10
"To analyze possible factors associated with the quality of life (QoL) of mothers of preterm infants with very low birth weight (VLBW) during the first 3 years after delivery. The World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL)-bref scores were compared and correlated with maternal and infant-related sociodemographic and clinical variables at maternal discharge (T0) and at 6 (T1), 12 (T2), 24 (T3), and 36 (T4) months after delivery. Multiple linear regression models were fitted to investigate the effect of these variables on the mothers' QoL. The WHOQOL-BREF physical domain scores were higher at T1 and T2 compared to T0 (p = 0.013). Maternal variables that contributed to maternal QoL scores (p < 0.05) were stable marital union (b = 13.60; T0), family income (b = -12.75; T3), Evangelical religion (b = 8.11; T4), and beck depression inventory (BDI) score (-1.42 ae b ae -0.36; T0, T1, T2, T3, and T4). Infants' variables that most affected maternal QoL (p < 0.05) were posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) (-18.84 ae b ae -10.05; T1, T2, and T4), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (b = -7.41; T2), female gender (b = 8.09; T2), and SNAPPE severity score (b = -0.23; T3). Mothers of preterm infants with VLBW exhibited transient improvements in physical well-being during the first year after delivery. The presence of depressive symptoms in mothers and the diagnosis of PHH or BPD were negatively associated with QoL. Social, religious, and economic aspects were also important factors for the QoL of mothers of preterm infants with VLBW.",18
"Despite the proposed benefits of applying shared and distributed leadership models in healthcare, few studies have explored the leadership beliefs of clinicians and ascertained whether differences exist between professions. The current article aims to address these gaps and, additionally, examine whether clinicians' leadership beliefs are associated with the strength of their professional and team identifications. An online survey was responded to by 229 healthcare workers from community interprofessional teams in mental health settings across the East of England. No differences emerged between professional groups in their leadership beliefs; all professions reported a high level of agreement with shared leadership. A positive association emerged between professional identification and shared leadership in that participants who expressed the strongest level of profession identification also reported the greatest agreement with shared leadership. The same association was demonstrated for team identification and shared leadership. The findings highlight the important link between group identification and leadership beliefs, suggesting that strategies that promote strong professional and team identifications in interprofessional teams are likely to be conducive to clinicians supporting principles of shared leadership. Future research is needed to strengthen this link and examine the leadership practices of healthcare workers.",66
"Suicidal behavior and difficulty regulating emotions are hallmarks of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). This study examined neural links between emotion regulation and suicide risk in BPD. 60 individuals with BPD (all female, mean age = 28.9 years), 46 of whom had attempted suicide, completed a fMRI task involving recalling aversive personal memories. Distance trials assessed the ability to regulate emotion by recalling memories from a third-person, objective viewpoint. Immerse trials assessed emotional reactivity and involved recalling memories from a first-person perspective. Behaviorally, both groups reported less negative affect on Distance as compared to Immerse trials. Neurally, two sets of findings were obtained. The first reflected differences between attempters and non-attempters. When immersing and distancing, attempters showed elevated recruitment of lateral orbitofrontal cortex, a brain region implicated in using negative cues to guide behavior. When distancing, attempters showed diminished recruitment of the precuneus, a region implicated in memory recall and perspective taking. The second set of findings related to individual differences in regulation success the degree to which individuals used distancing to reduce negative affect. Here, we observed that attempters who successfully regulated exhibited precuneus recruitment that was more similar to non-attempters. These data provide insight into mechanisms underlying suicide attempts in BPD. Future work may examine if these findings generalize to other diagnoses and also whether prior findings in BPD differ across attempters and non-attempters. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Prospective studies showed that low serum testosterone concentrations are associated with various cardiometabolic risk factors and mortality. However, the causal nature of these associations is controversial. We studied 1 882 men aged 20-79 years with serum testosterone concentrations and genotyping data from the longitudinal population-based Study of Health in Pomerania. Testosterone concentrations were cross-sectionally associated with cardiometabolic risk factors, including anthropometric, lipid, blood pressure and glycaemic parameters; and prospectively with all-cause mortality (277 deaths, 14.7%) during the 10-year follow-up. To overcome problems of residual confounding, reverse causation, or regression dilution bias in the investigated testosterone-outcome associations, we used two-stage least square regression models with previously identified polymorphisms at the SHBG gene (rs12150660) and X chromosome (rs5934505) as multiple genetic instruments in an instrumental variable (IV) approach, also known as Mendelian randomization. In standard regression analyses, testosterone was robustly associated with a wide range of cardiometabolic risk factors. In subsequent IV analyses, no such significant associations were observed. Similarly, prospective analyses showed a consistent association of low testosterone concentrations with increased all-cause mortality risk, which was not apparent in subsequent IV analyses. The present Mendelian randomization analyses did not detect any evidence for causal associations of testosterone concentrations with cardiometabolic risk factors and mortality, suggesting that previously reported associations might largely result from residual confounding or reverse causation. Although testosterone assessment might improve risk prediction, implementation of testosterone replacement therapy requires further evidence of a direct effect on cardiometabolic outcomes from double-blinded randomized controlled trials and large-scale Mendelian randomization meta-analyses.",6
"Because hydrogen can be extracted naturally and stored for a long time, different types of fuel cells have been developed to generate clean power, particularly for use in vehicles. However, the power demand of a running vehicle leads to unstable and irregular loading of fuel cells. This not only reduces fuel cell lifespan and efficiency but also affects driving safety when the slow output response cannot satisfy an abrupt increase in power demand. Magnetic flywheels with characteristics such as high energy density, high-speed charging ability, and low loss have been extensively used in Formula One cars. This study developed a hybrid powertrain in which a magnetic flywheel system (MFS) is integrated with the fuel cells to solve the aforementioned problems. Moreover, an auto-tuning proportional integral derivative (PID) controller based on the controls of a multiple adaptive neuro-fuzzy interference system and particle swarm optimization was designed for MFS control. Furthermore, MATLAB/Simulink simulations considering an FTP-75 urban driving cycle were conducted, and a variability improvement of approximately 273% in fuel cell output was achieved.

"Aims. Population surveys have become a frequently used method to explore stigma, help-seeking and illness beliefs related to mental illness. Methodological quality however differs greatly between studies, and our current knowledge seems heavily biased towards high-income countries. A critical appraisal of advances and shortcomings of psychiatric attitude research is missing. This review summarises and appraises the state of the art in population-based attitude research on mental health. Methods. Systematic review of all peer-reviewed papers reporting representative population studies on beliefs and attitudes about mental disorders published between January 2005 and December 2014 (n=478). Results. Over the decade covered by this review considerably more papers on psychiatric attitude research have been published than over the whole time period before. Most papers originated in Europe (36.3%), North America (23.2%) and Australia (22.6%), only 14.6% of all papers included data from low- or middle income countries. The vast majority of papers (80.1%) used correlational cross-sectional analyses, only 4% used experimental or quasi-experimental designs. Data in 45.9% of all papers were obtained with face-to-face interviews, followed by telephone (34.5%), mail (7.3%) and online surveys (4.0%). In almost half of papers (44.6%) case-vignettes served as stimulus for eliciting responses from interviewees. In 20.7% instruments meeting established psychometric criteria were used. The most frequently studied disorder was depression (44.6% of all paper), followed by schizophrenia (33%). 11.7% of papers reported time trend analyses of attitudes and beliefs, 7.5% cross-cultural comparisons. The most common focus of research was on mental health literacy (in total 63.4% of all papers, followed by various forms of stigma (48.3%).There was a scarcity of papers (12.1%) based on established theoretical frameworks. Conclusions. In the current boom of attitude research, an avant-garde of studies uses profound and innovative methodology, but there are still blind spots and a large proportion of conventional studies. We discuss current and future methodological challenges that psychiatric attitude research needs to embrace. More innovative and methodologically sound studies are needed to provide an empirical basis for evidence-based interventions aimed at reducing misconceptions about mental disorders and improve attitudes towards those afflicted.",69
"A unique course named ""Introduction to Engineering Design"" has been recently developed and implemented at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. The course allows top 12th grade students who are majoring in science and engineering to experience engineering design. At the end of the course, the students plan and implement-on a team basis-a real-time control system for an electric motor. The course is intended to increase its graduates' motivation in science and engineering, develop their systems thinking skills and train them in teamwork, as such skills will assist them in their future engineering work. The study described in this paper examined-through quantitative and qualitative tools-to what degree the course's first two objectives had been attained. Thirty-two students participated in the study and its findings indicate an improvement in the students' intrinsic motivation to study science and engineering (medium effect size) and in their systems thinking skills (large effect size).",53
"Acquired angioedema (AAE) due to C1-inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency is rare. Treatment options for acute attacks are variable and used off-label. Successful treatment of the associated lymphoma with rituximab seems to prevent acute attacks in subjects with AAE. The aim of this study was to describe AAE manifestations, its associated diseases, and patients' responses to treatments in a representative cohort. A retrospective nationwide study was conducted in France. The inclusion criteria were recurrent angioedema attacks and an acquired decrease in functional C1INH <50% of the reference value. A total of 92 cases were included, with a median age at onset of 62 years. Facial edema and abdominal pain were the most frequent symptoms. Fifteen patients were hospitalized in the intensive care unit because of laryngeal edema, and 1 patient died. Anti-C1INH antibodies were present in 43 patients. The associated diseases were primarily non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n=44, with 24 splenic marginal zone lymphomas) and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (n=24). Three patients had myeloma, 1 had amyloid light-chain (of immunoglobulin) (AL) amyloidosis, 1 patient had a bronchial adenocarcinoma, and 19 patients had no associated disease. Icatibant relieved the symptoms in all treated patients (n=26), and plasma-derived C1INH concentrate in 19 of 21 treated patients. Six patients experienced thromboembolic events under tranexamic acid prophylaxis. Rituximab prevented angioedema in 27 of 34 patients as a monotherapy or in association with chemotherapy. Splenectomy controlled AAE in 7 patients treated for splenic marginal zone lymphoma. After a median follow-up of 4.2 years, angioedema was on remission in 52 patients. AAE cases are primarily associated with indolent lymphoma-especially splenic marginal zone lymphoma-and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance but not with autoimmune diseases or other conditions. Icatibant and plasma-derived C1INH concentrate control attacks; splenectomy and immunochemotherapy prevent angioedema in lymphoma setting.",131
"Sleep problems are common in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This study aimed to examine the following: (1) predictors of sleep quality and (2) fluctuations in sleep quality in patients with SLE. Patients with SLE were recruited from three rheumatology centers in Japan. We collected demographic and clinical data and data on sleep quality as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Medical Outcome Study Short Form-12, and the Lupus Patient Reported Outcome Tool (LupusPRO). Fluctuations in sleep quality were examined by administering the PSQI a second time after a 2-week interval. We used multiple linear regression analysis to predict sleep quality. Of 205 patients who completed the survey, 62.9% showed poor sleep quality. The largest fluctuation in sleep quality was for ""waking in the middle of the night or early morning."" ""LupusPRO pain/vitality"" was a major predictor of poor sleep. The other significant predictors were mostly LupusPRO subscales and clinical variables and SF-12 subscales were mostly non-predictive. The majority of the participants had poor sleep quality. A lupus-specific QoL scale is important for understanding poor sleep quality in SLE patients. Symptom management appeared to play a key role in improving sleep quality.",69
"The autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA) is an entity that includes different autoimmune conditions observed after exposure to an adjuvant. Patients with undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) present many signs and symptoms of ASIA, alluding to the idea that an exposure to adjuvants can be a trigger also for UCTD. The aim of this case-control study was to investigate exposure to adjuvants prior to disease onset in patients affected by UCTD. Ninety-two UCTD patients and 92 age- and sex-matched controls with no malignancy, chronic infections, autoimmune disease nor family history of autoimmune diseases were investigated for exposure to adjuvants. An ad hoc-created questionnaire exploring the exposure to vaccinations, foreign materials and environmental and occupational exposures was administered to both cases and controls. Autoantibodies were also analyzed (anti-nuclear, anti-extractable nuclear antigens, anti-double-stranded DNA, anti-cardiolipin, anti-beta 2 glycoprotein I). UCTD patients displayed a greater exposure to HBV (p = 0.018) and tetanus toxoid (p < 0.001) vaccinations, metal implants (p < 0.001), cigarette smoking (p = 0.006) and pollution due to metallurgic factories and foundries (p = 0.048) as compared to controls. UCTD patients exposed to major ASIA triggers (vaccinations, silicone implants) (n = 49) presented more frequently with chronic fatigue (p < 0.001), general weakness (p = 0.011), irritable bowel syndrome (p = 0.033) and a family history for autoimmunity (p = 0.018) in comparison to non-exposed UCTDs. ASIA and UCTD can be considered as related entities in the ""mosaic of autoimmunity"": the genetic predisposition and the environmental exposure to adjuvants elicit a common clinical phenotype characterized by signs and symptoms of systemic autoimmunity.",4
"Here we review the principles based on which aggression is rendered abnormal in humans and laboratory rodents, and comparatively overview the main methodological approaches based on which this behavior is studied in the two categories of subjects. It appears that the discriminating property of abnormal aggression is rule breaking, which renders aggression dysfunctional from the point of view of the perpetrator. We show that rodent models of abnormal aggression were created by the translation of human conditions into rodent equivalents, and discuss how findings obtained with such models may be ""translated back"" to human conditions when the mechanisms underlying aggression and its possibilities of treatment are investigated. We suggest that the complementary nature of human and rodent research approaches invite a more intense cross-talk between the two sides of aggression research than the one presently observed.

"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic progressive disease that has complicated mechanisms that involve inflammation and cartilage degradation. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory action of Salvianolic acid B (Sal B) in both human OA chondrocytes and a mouse OA model that was induced by destabilization of the medial meniscus. In vitro, chondrocytes were pretreated with Sal B (0, 25, 50, 100 mu M) for 2 h, then incubated with IL-1 beta (10 ng/mL) for 24 h. NO production was determined by Griess method and PGE2 was assessed by ELISA. The expression of INOS, COX-2, MMP-13, ADAMTS-5 and NE-kappa B-related signaling molecules were tested by Western blotting. Immunofluorescence staining was used to detect P65 nuclear translocation. In vivo, the mouse OA model received intraperitoneal-injection of either Sal B (25 mg/kg) or saline every other day. Hematoxylin and Eosin, as well as Safranin-O-Fast green staining, were utilized to evaluate the severity of cartilage lesions up to 8 weeks following the surgery. Sal B inhibited the over-production of NO and PGE2, while the elevated expression of INOS, COX-2, MMP-13 and ADAMTS-5 were reversed by Sal B in IL-1 beta-induced chondrocytes. In addition, IL-1 beta significantly induced phosphorylation of NF-kappa B signaling, and this phosphorylation response was blocked by Sal B. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that Sal B could suppress IL-1 beta-induced p65 nuclear translocation. In vivo, the cartilage in Sal B-treated mice exhibited less cartilage degradation and lower OARSI scores. Taken together, Sal B possesses great potential value as a therapeutic agent for OA treatment. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.",15
"In this paper, based on a variable-coefficient nonlinear Schrodinger (vcNLS) equation, amplification of the fundamental and second-order unchirped solitons in the dispersion-decreasing fiber without any external amplification device, which is different from those in the existing literatures, is studied. Via symbolic computation, soliton solutions of the vcNLS equation are obtained. For a fundamental-soliton pulse, the amplitude is amplified by the gain during the propagation, whereas the width keeps unchanged. Because of the equilibrium between the gain, nonlinearity and varying dispersion, soliton structure is not destroyed, and the amplified fundamental soliton is free from the pedestal and chirp. With the increase of the absolute value of the gain coefficient , magnification of the fundamental-soliton amplitude is enhanced in the same propagation distance. For the second-order soliton, the width is compressed and the amplitude is amplified, because the amplification process is accompanied by the compression of the soliton. Period of the second-order soliton decreases exponentially during the propagation, and decreases with the increase of the absolute value of in the same propagation distance.",24
"The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of novel software-CMF-preCADS-for the prediction of soft tissue changes following repositioning surgery for zygomatic fractures. Twenty patients who had sustained an isolated zygomatic fracture accompanied by facial deformity and who were treated with repositioning surgery participated in this study. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans and three-dimensional (3D) stereophotographs were acquired preoperatively and postoperatively. The 3D skeletal model from the preoperative CBCT data was matched with the postoperative one, and the fractured zygomatic fragments were segmented and aligned to the postoperative position for prediction. Then, the predicted model was matched with the postoperative 3D stereophotograph for quantification of the simulation error. The mean absolute error in the zygomatic soft tissue region between the predicted model and the real one was 1.42 +/- 1.56 mm for all cases. The accuracy of the prediction (mean absolute error <= 2 mm) was 87%. In the subjective assessment it was found that the majority of evaluators considered the predicted model and the postoperative model to be 'very similar'. CMF-preCADS software can provide a realistic, accurate prediction of the facial soft tissue appearance after repositioning surgery for zygomatic fractures. The reliability of this software for other types of repositioning surgery for maxillofacial fractures should be validated in the future.",82
"Rapidly multiplying cancer cells synthesize greater amounts of cholesterol to build their membranes. Cholesterol-lowering drugs (statins) are currently in clinical trials for anti-cancer chemotherapy. However, given at higher doses, statins cause serious side effects by inhibiting the formation of other biologically important molecules derived from mevalonate. Sterol 14 alpha-demethylase (CYP51), which acts 10 steps downstream, is potentially a more specific drug target because this portion of the pathway is fully committed to cholesterol production. However, screening a variety of commercial and experimental inhibitors of microbial CYP51 orthologs revealed that most of them (including all clinical antifungals) weakly inhibit human CYP51 activity, even if they display high apparent spectral binding affinity. Only one relatively potent compound, (R)-N-(1-(3,4'-difluorobiphenyl-4-yl)-2-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)ethyl)-4-(5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl) benzamide (VFV), was identified. VFV has been further tested in cellular experiments and found to decrease proliferation of different cancer cell types.(jlr) The crystal structures of human CYP51-VFV complexes (2.0 and 2.5 angstrom) both display a 2:1 inhibitor/enzyme stoichiometry, provide molecular insights regarding a broader substrate profile, faster catalysis, and weaker susceptibility of human CYP51 to inhibition, and outline directions for the development of more potent inhibitors.-Hargrove, T.

"The mysid, Leptomysis lingvura, is found along east coast of Gran Canaria (Spain) swimming in the plankton above sandy bottoms at depths between 5 and 15 m. As with many mysids around the world, it is an important component in the food chain for many coastal fish and could be a potential live prey for use in aquaculture (Herrera et al., 2011; Jumars, 2007). We studied L lingvura's survival and reproduction in captivity and determined its suitability for physiological and biochemical research in the laboratory. This mysid proved to adapt well to aquarium life and to be highly suitable for studying respiratory metabolism. This investigation documents the effect of feeding and starvation on the enzymology and physiology of respiration. The research strategy was to follow a simple time course of both the oxygen consumption rate of whole mysids and the activity of their respiratory electron transport system (ETS). Respiration (R) decreased logarithmically during starvation whereas the ETS activity remained constant. As a consequence, the ratio of R to ETS activity decreased along with the respiration. Superimposed on the declining respiration rate was an unforeseen diel rhythm that elevated R during the light and depressed it during the dark. The slope in the R-biomass log-log Kleiber plot in well fed mysids is close to 0.75 while for starved mysids it was lower than 0.75. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",36
"Child abuse is a global public health problem and a serious social issue in Japan. Social support is beneficial for parents faced with childrearing challenges. The aim of this study was to clarify the association between social support and child abuse potential. A cross-sectional study was conducted using a structured questionnaire. The target population was mothers of children at nine public nursery schools. Bivariate and multiple linear regression analysis were performed to examine the effects of socio-demographic, social support and psychological distress factors on child abuse potential. Among 309 mothers, 29 (9.4%) had a high child abuse potential score. Bivariate analysis indicated that mothers with a higher child abuse potential score were more likely to be divorced or unmarried (P < 0.001); living in single-female-parent households (P < 0.001); have low perceived economic status (P < 0.001); have a low level of child care support (P = 0.01); have a low Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) score (P < 0.001); and/or a high General Health Questionnaire -12 score (GHQ -12) (P < 0.001). Important predictors of child abuse potential among the mothers surveyed included living in single-female-parent households, having low perceived economic status, low MSPSS score, and high GHQ -12 score. Improving approaches that help mothers build social support relationships and ease them into child rearing in a psychologically healthy condition is recommended to prevent child abuse.

"Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) during sleep has been studied extensively in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Prevalence and prognostic significance of CSR during wakefulness in CHF, however, are largely unknown. CSR during wakefulness with an apnea-hypopnea cut-off ae5/h and moderate to severe CSR with an apnea-hypopnea cutoff ae15/h were analyzed using polysomnographic recordings in 267 patients with stable CHF with reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction at our institution. Primary endpoint during follow-up was heart transplant-free survival. Fifty of 267 patients (19%) had CSR during wakefulness and 73 of 267 patients (27%) had CSR during sleep. CSR during wakefulness was associated with advanced age, atrial fibrillation, decreased LV ejection fraction, increased LV end-diastolic diameter, brain natriuretic peptide, New York Heart Failure class, and CSR during sleep. During 43 months mean follow-up, 67 patients (25%) died and 4 patients (1%) underwent heart transplantation. Multivariate Cox analysis identified age, male gender, chronic kidney disease, and LV ejection fraction as predictors of reduced transplant-free survival. CSR during wakefulness with an apnea-hypopnea cutoff ae5/h as well as moderate to severe CSR while awake using an apnea-hypopnea cutoff ae 15/h did not predict reduced transplant-free survival independently from confounding factors. CSR during wakefulness appears to be a marker of heart failure severity.",111
"Dinoflagellates are key species in marine environments, but they remain poorly understood in part because of their large, complex genomes, unique molecular biology, and unresolved in-group relationships. We created a taxonomically representative dataset of dinoflagellate transcriptomes and used this to infer a strongly supported phylogeny to map major morphological and molecular transitions in dinoflagellate evolution. Our results show an early-branching position of Noctiluca, monophyly of thecate (plate-bearing) dinoflagellates, and paraphyly of athecate ones. This represents unambiguous phylogenetic evidence for a single origin of the group's cellulosic theca, which we show coincided with a radiation of cellulases implicated in cell division. By integrating dinoflagellate molecular, fossil, and biogeochemical evidence, we propose a revised model for the evolution of thecal tabulations and suggest that the late acquisition of dinosterol in the group is inconsistent with dinoflagellates being the source of this biomarker in pre-Mesozoic strata. Three distantly related, fundamentally nonphotosynthetic dinoflagellates, Noctiluca, Oxyrrhis, and Dinophysis, contain cryptic plastidial metabolisms and lack alternative cytosolic pathways, suggesting that all free-living dinoflagellates are metabolically dependent on plastids. This finding led us to propose general mechanisms of dependency on plastid organelles in eukaryotes that have lost photosynthesis; it also suggests that the evolutionary origin of bioluminescence in nonphotosynthetic dinoflagellates may be linked to plastidic tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. Finally, we use our phylogenetic framework to show that dinoflagellate nuclei have recruited DNA-binding proteins in three distinct evolutionary waves, which included two independent acquisitions of bacterial histone-like proteins.",30
"This article, for the first time, presents the generation of Roots rotor tooth profiles based on an Assur-group-associated virtual linkage method. Taking the original Roots rotor as an example, structure and geometry of the Roots rotor are introduced, and based on the principle of inversion, an equivalent virtual linkage is identified for generating dedendum tooth profile of the rotor. Using linkage decomposition associated with elemental Assur groups, algorithm for computing the tooth curve is constructed leading to the explicit expression of rotor profile and the corresponding numerical simulation, verifying the validity of the proposed approach. For demonstration purpose, the virtual linkage method is then extended to the generation of tooth profiles for the variants of Roots rotors with arc-cycloidal curves and arc-involute curves. Integrated with computer-aided design, computer-aided engineering and computer-aided manufacturing software platforms, as well as the three-dimensional printing technology, this article provides an efficient and intuitive approach for Roots rotor system design, analysis and development.",82
"Study Design. Retrospective cohort. Objective. The purpose of the present study was to examine the incidence and risk factors for postoperative hematoma requiring reoperation in patients undergoing single-level lumbar fusion surgery. Summary of Background Data. Postoperative hematoma can cause devastating neurological consequences after spine surgery. Risk factors for hematoma in specific spine procedures have not been well established. Methods. A cohort of patients undergoing single-level lumbar fusion surgery was constructed from the 2012 to 2013 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program dataset using Current Procedural Terminology codes (22533, 22558, 22612, 22630, and 22633). In cases requiring reoperation within 30 days after initial surgery, postoperative hematoma was identified using the ICD-9 code 998.1. Risk factors for postoperative hematoma were assessed with logistic regression modeling. Results. Of 5280 patients undergoing single-level lumbar fusion surgery, 27 patients (0.5%) developed a postoperative hematoma requiring reoperation for hematoma evacuation. A heightened incidence of postoperative hematoma was found in patients who were smokers (1.0% vs. 0.4% for nonsmokers, P = 0.016) or who had a diagnosis of bleeding disorder (3.8% vs. 0.5% for those without bleeding disorder, P = 0.007). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the adjusted odds ratios for postoperative hematoma associated with smoking and bleeding disorder were 3.34 (95% confidence interval, 1.15-9.71) and 10.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.9-54.8), respectively. Conclusion. Smoking and bleeding disorder appear to be major risk factors for postoperative hematoma requiring reoperation after single-level lumbar fusion surgery. Intervention programs targeting patients with these risk factors are needed to reduce their excess risk of postoperative hematoma.",26
"In the Indian Himalayan region (IHR), landslide-driven hazards have intensified over the past several decades primarily caused by the occurrence of heavy and extreme rainfall. However, little attention has been given to determining the cause of events triggered during pre- and post-Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) seasons. In the present research, detailed geological, meteorological, and remote sensing investigations have been carried out on an extreme rainfall landslide event that occurred in Sadal village, Udhampur district, Jammu and Kashmir Himalaya, during September 2014. Toward the receding phase of the ISM (i.e., in the month of September 2014), an unusual rainfall event of similar to 488.2 mm rainfall in 24 h took place in Jammu and Kashmir Himalaya in contrast to the normal rainfall occurrence. Geological investigations suggest that a planar weakness in the affected region is caused by bedding planes that consist of an alternate sequence of hard, compact sandstone and weak claystone. During this extreme rainfall event, the Sadal village was completely buried under the rock slides, as failure occurred along the planar weakness that dips toward the valley slope. Rainfall data analysis from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) for the preceding years homogeneous time series (July-September) indicates that the years 2005, 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2014 (i.e., closely spaced and clustering heavy rainfall events) received heavy rainfalls during the withdrawal of the ISM; whereas the heaviest rainfall was received in the years 2003 and 2013 at the onset of the ISM in the study region. This suggests that no characteristic cyclicity exists for extreme rainfall events. However, we observe that either toward the onset of the ISM or its retreat, the extreme rainfall facilitates landslides, rockfall, and slope failures in northwestern Himalaya. The spatiotemporal distribution of landslides caused by extreme rainfall events suggests its confinement toward the windward side of the Himalayan front. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

"Background: Unintended pregnancy is a complex phenomenon which raise to take an emergency decision. Low contraceptive prevalence and high user failure rates are the leading causes of this unexpected situation. High user failure rates suggest the vital role of emergency contraception to prevent unplanned pregnancy. Levonorgestrel - a commonly used progestin for emergency contraception. However, little is known about its pharmacokinetics and optimal dose for use. Hence, there is a need to conduct a systematic review of the available evidences. Methods: Randomized, double-blind trials were sought, evaluating healthy women with regular menstrual cycles, who requested emergency contraception within 72 h of unprotected coitus, to one of three regimens: 1.5 mg single dose levonorgestrel, two doses of 0.75 mg levonorgestrel given 12 h apart or two doses of 0.75 mg levonorgestrel given 24 h apart. The primary outcome was unintended pregnancy; other outcomes were side-effects and timing of next menstruation. Results: Every trial under consideration successfully established the contraceptive effectiveness of levonorgestrel for preventing unintended pregnancy. Moreover, a single dose of levonorgestrel 1.5 mg for emergency contraception supports its safety and efficacy profile. If two doses of levonorgestrel 0.75 mg are intended for administration, the second dose can positively be taken 12-24 h after the first dose without compromising its contraceptive efficacy. The main side effect was frequent menstrual irregularities. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions: The review shows that, emergency contraceptive regimen of single-dose levonorgestrel is not inferior in efficacy to the two-dose regimen. All the regimens studied were very efficacious for emergency contraception and prevented a high proportion of pregnancies if taken within 72 h of unprotected coitus. Single levonorgestrel dose (1.5 mg) can substitute two 0.75 mg doses 12 or 24 h apart. With either regimen, the earlier the treatment is given, the more effective it seems to be.",124
"Activity recognition of an elderly person can be used to provide information and intelligent services to health care professionals, carers, elderly people, and their families so that the elderly people can remain at homes independently. This study investigates the use and contribution of wrist-worn multisensors for activity recognition. We found that accelerometers are the most important sensors and heart rate data can be used to boost classification of activities with diverse heart rates. We propose a genetic algorithm-based fusion weight selection (GAFW) approach which utilizes GA to find fusion weights. For all possible classifier combinations and fusion methods, the study shows that 98% of times GAFW can achieve equal or higher accuracy than the best classifier within the group.",92
"Ultra low power signal processing is an essential part of all sensor nodes, and particularly so in emerging wearable sensors for biomedical applications. Analog signal processing has an important role in these low power, low voltage, low frequency applications, and there is a key drive to decrease the power consumption of existing analog domain signal processing and to map more signal processing approaches into the analog domain. This paper presents an analog domain signal processing circuit which approximates the output of the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for use in ultra low power wearable sensors. Analog filters are used for the DWT filters and it is demonstrated how these generate analog domain DWT-like information that embeds information from Butterworth and Daubechies maximally flat mother wavelet responses. The Analog DWT is realised in hardware via gmC circuits, designed to operate from a 1.3 V coin cell battery, and provide DWT-like signal processing using under 115 nW of power when implemented in a 0.18 m CMOS process. Practical examples demonstrate the effective use of the new Analog DWT on ECG (electrocardiogram) and EEG (electroencephalogram) signals recorded from humans.",52
"In order to reduce the time complexity of situation element acquisition and to cope with the low detection accuracy of small class samples caused by imbalanced class distribution of attack samples in wireless sensor networks, a situation element extraction mechanism based on deep auto-encoder network is proposed. In this mechanism, the deep auto-encoder network is introduced as basic classifier to identify data type. In hierarchical training of the auto-encoder, a training method based on cross-entropy loss function and back-propagation algorithm is proposed to overcome the problem of weights updating too slow by the traditional variance cost function, and the momentum factors are added to improve the convergence performance. Meanwhile, in the stage of fine-tuning and classification of the deep network, an active online sampling algorithm is proposed to select the sample online for updating the network weights, so as to eliminate redundancy of the total samples, balance the amounts of all sample types, and improve the classification accuracy of small sample. Through the simulation and analysis of the instance data, the scheme has a good accuracy of situation factors extraction.",46
"Objective: As many inflammatory rheumatic diseases affect patients in childbearing age, some concern has been expressed about the safety of biologic drugs during pregnancy. This study evaluated the effects of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) agents on pregnancy/foetal outcomes. Methods: Thirty-eight pregnancies were followed prospectively from November 2008 to February 2015. Information about the patients' exposure to anti-TNF alpha, disease activity, DMARD therapy, pregnancy/foetal outcomes were registered. Results: Twenty-four/38 (71.1%) pregnancies were exposed to anti-TNF alpha at conception/I trimester, 11/38 (28.9%) prior to conception and 3 (11.1%) following paternal exposure. There were two congenital malformations: one infant (4.2%) was diagnosed with congenital diaphragmatic hernia and obstructive megaureter; the mother was exposed to adalimumab at conception/I trimester. While one foetus (9.1%) showed a trisomy 16, the mother 38 year-old had suspended etanercept 4 weeks before conception. There was no significant difference in pregnancy/foetal outcome between the two groups. Nor were there any significant differences in pregnancy/foetal outcomes in the various groups being treated with different anti-TNF alpha antagonists. No congenital malformations were found in connection to paternal exposure. Conclusion: Study results suggest that anti-TNF alpha drugs could be safe when administered during conception/I trimester and following paternal exposure. (C) 2016 Societe francaise de rhumatologie.

"Load balancing algorithms and task scheduling are one of the most important tasks in parallel application design and implementation. Proper task assignment to processor cores can minimize execution time and increase the performance of a parallel application. In this paper, we propose a combined load balancing algorithm based on a mixture of well-known domain decomposition and master-slave algorithms. The proposed algorithm minimizes load imbalance and communication between independent tasks. The proposed algorithm improved parallel efficiency using task rescheduling, which had been confirmed with simulation results.",2
"The purpose of the Charpy test is to determine the impact resistance of materials. It makes it possible to measure their impact strength. It consists of breaking a standard notched bar using a pendulum hammer. The notch can take various forms: out of U or, generally, out of V The power consumption to break the bar is measured by making the difference between the drop height of the hammer and that to which it goes up after having broken the bar. If this last were completely brittle, the hammer would go up with the same height as that from where it fell. If it were on the contrary extremely tough, it would not be broken and the pendulum would not go up at all. The fracture energy thus determined is called impact strength. More it is raised, more the material is tough. Today, this test is identified by measuring of the impact force in accordance with ISO 148-1 and largely used for industrial materials. However, with technological evolution of industrial materials used in manufacturing engineering, other test methods have been developed, in time and complexity, to characterise particularly thin sheet welded pieces (tailored blanks) used in automotive industry. However, one may see a little development in this domain for thin plates regarding to thick plates. This paper reports the early history of instrumented impact testing, started from Augustin Georges Albert CHARPY (1865-1945) up to now, and gives a comparative study on the recent results of experiments obtained on the different welded steel grades by means of the new developed machine called impact tensile crash test or simulated crash test and presents of new ""ductile/brittle"" transition diagrams concerning different welding techniques. This concerns dynamic testing of the welded pieces used in automotive industry. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",84
"Thermo-electric modules (TEMs) can be used to convert heat into electricity by utilizing the Seeback effect. It is now possible to buy BiTe thermo-electric modules that can operate up to temperatures of around 300 degrees C. However, many applications, such as the harvesting of excess gas turbine heat, may occur at higher temperatures. Therefore, new materials and manufacturing processes need to be developed to produce packaged TEMs that can operate at a maximum operating temperature of 650 degrees C. Two critical areas in the manufacture of a SiGe TEM are the choice and strength of materials used to both sintered joint the TE material to the rest of the module and the metal used for the interconnects. The interconnection material needs to be sufficiently strong to withstand large temperature fluctuations while maintaining a low contact resistance, as well as being compatible with the nano-Ag sintered joint. Shear force tests of the sintered thermo electrical leg material showed that the joints are brittle when sintered to W metallized AIN substrates are used and ductile fracture behavior when sintered to Cu metallized AIN substrates using the NanoTach K nano silver paste. Almost all of the joints were found to be brittle when using the NachTach X nano silver paste. Shear testing of the sintered joints showed that the X paste joints were variable in strength and stiffness, having a typical Young's modulus between 10 and 100 MPa at room temperature. The K paste joints were stiffer, but had a similar strength as compared to the X paste joints. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",91
"Regulatory and technological aspects of cloud technology are showing both opportunities and gaps in the rules on security and accessibility. Our proposal aims at addressing a problem that has not yet manifested using a protocol and discussing the normative aspects regarding the possibility of rendering a document completely immaterial. Our article proposes a protocol that uses the network in an unconventional way to make a document fully immaterial. By immaterial we mean that is not localisable anywhere in its entirety. If we continue the analogy to climate, we want to realise a fog of files rather than a cloud. The files are distributed on a public or private network and only the injectors and extractors can access them. The inaccessibility by others, the non-location, and the dynamics of the system offer significant advantages in terms of security but raise some legal problems.",46
"Let D be a collection of D documents, which are strings over an alphabet of size a, of total length n. We describe a data structure that uses linear space and reports k most relevant documents that contain a query pattern P, which is a string of length p packed in p/ log(sigma) n words, in time O(p/ log(sigma) n+ k). This is optimal in the RAM model in the general case where log D = Theta(logn), and involves a novel RAM-optimal suffix tree search. Our construction supports an ample set of important relevance measures, such as the number of times P appears in a document (called term frequency), a fixed document importance, and the minimal distance between two occurrences of P in a document. When log D = o(logn), we show how to reduce the space of the data structure from O(n log n) to O(n(log sigma + log D log log n)) bits, and to O(n(log sigma- + log D)) bits in the case of the popular term frequency measure of relevance, at the price of an additive term O(log epsilon(sigma) n) in the query time, for any constant epsilon >0. We also consider the dynamic scenario, where documents can be inserted and deleted from the collection. We obtain linear space and query time O(p(log log n)(2)/ log(sigma) n + log n + k log log k), whereas insertions and deletions require O(log(l+epsilon) (sigma) n) time per symbol, for any constant epsilon >0. Finally, we consider an extended static scenario where an extra parameter par(P, d) is defined, and the query must retrieve only documents d such that par(P, d) epsilon [T1, T2], where this range is specified at query time. We solve these queries using linear space and O(p/ log (sigma) n + log (1+epsilon) n+ k loge n) time, for any constant epsilon >0. Our technique is to translate these top-k problems into multidimensional geometric search problems. As a bonus, we describe some improvements to those problems.",41
"This paper documents the utility of the online tool ""rainwater harvesting and demand simulation"" forwarded by URL http://gettanked.orgi, and categorizes performance variability with respect to KOppen-Geiger climatic classifications of the Australian continent. This is a novel tool because it dynamically calculates the irrigation and evaporative cooling demands in addition to any particular per diem allocation of potable water. The analysis may be either from a finite storage tank of specified capacity, or drawn from water mains, but the present paper is focused on the design of secure off-grid rainwater harvesting systems (RWHS). The nominal consumption target of 155 L per diem per capita must be reduced by varying degrees depending on the locality. Higher demand can be met if sufficient catchment and capacity are provided, or if regular tanker deliveries are readily available. Alternatively, demand restrictions are tabulated as guidance to avoid running dry within the constraints of a nominal 10,000 L capacity storage with 100 m2 catchment-defining the sustainable load per diem (SLPD) during a ""worst case"" epoch-this is the break-point for off-grid security. SLPD varies from 86 to 124 L/d among most temperate maritime climate stations, and between 35 and 42 Lid at most desert climate stations. The supporting on-line operating manual includes tabulations of demand for evaporative cooling and irrigation together with the sustainable yield of a rainwater harvest system at 128 locations throughout Australia. Dynamics of non-potable demands should be resolved before using the GetTanked design tool for any particular dwelling or workplace. Indoor and potable water demand must be disaggregated from irrigation, pool evaporation, and evaporative cooling in order to fully exploit the GetTanked tool. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"Background and ObjectiveThe goal of periodontal therapy is to regenerate/reconstruct the damaged supporting tissues of diseased teeth and to facilitate recovery of their physiological functions. Combination of stem cell transplantation and gene therapy offers a viable method for accelerating periodontal repair and regeneration. In this study, the role of the ephrinB2/EphB4 signaling pathway in regulating osteogenic differentiation of periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) and crosstalk between PDLSCs and pre-osteoblasts within co-culture was investigated through ephrinB2 transgenic expression in PDLSCs. Material and MethodsPDLSCs isolated from premolar teeth of teenage patients undergoing orthodontic treatment were transfected with transgenic (hEfnB2-GFP-Bsd) vector or empty vector (GFP-Bsd). Vector-PDLSCs, EfnB2-PDLSCs, MC3T3-E1 and co-cultures of vector-PDLSCs with MC3T3-E1, and EfnB2-PDLSCs with MC3T3-E1 were subjected to osteogenic induction. The osteogenic differentiation of EfnB2-PDLSCs, vector-PDLSCs and co-cultures were assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay and Alizarin-red S staining. Protein expression levels of ephrinB2, EphB4, phosphorylated ephrinB2 and EphB4 were analyzed by western blot, immunoprecipitation and co-immunoprecipitation assays. ResultsALP assay and Alizarin-red S staining demonstrated higher ALP activity and increased mineralization with EfnB2-PDLSCs vs. vector-PDLSCs and with co-culture of EfnB2-PDLSCs and MC3T3-E1 vs. vector-PDLSCs and MC3T3-E1. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that the expression of human odonto/osteogenic markers were significantly enhanced in EfnB2-PDLSCs compared to vector-PDLSCs, and that the expression of mouse odonto/osteogenic markers were significantly higher in co-culture of EfnB2-PDLSCs with MC3T3-E1 vs. vector-PDLSCs with MC3T3-E1. The EphB4 receptor was activated through phosphorylation during osteogenic differentiation. ConclusionOur data indicate that transgenic expression of ephrinB2 in PDLSCs could promote osteogenic differentiation via stimulation of the phosphorylation of ephrinB2 and EphB4, which regulates cell communication between PDLSCs and between PDLSCs and pre-osteoblasts within co-culture.",37
"The tigrina (tig)-d.12 mutant of barley is impaired in the negative control limiting excess protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) accumulation in the dark. Upon illumination, Pchlide operates as photosensitizer and triggers singlet oxygen production and cell death. Here, we show that both Pchlide and singlet oxygen operate as signals that control gene expression and metabolite accumulation in tig-d.12 plants. In vivo labeling, Northern blotting, polysome profiling, and protein gel blot analyses revealed a selective suppression of synthesis of the small and large subunits of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RBCSs and RBCLs), the major light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein of photosystem II (LHCB2), as well as other chlorophyll-binding proteins, in response to singlet oxygen. In part, these effects were caused by an arrest in translation initiation of photosynthetic transcripts at 80S cytoplasmic ribosomes. The observed changes in translation correlated with a decline in the phosphorylation level of ribosomal protein S6. At later stages, ribosome dissociation occurred. Together, our results identify translation as a major target of singlet oxygen-dependent growth control and cell death in higher plants.",38
"Shikonin, a major effective component in the Chinese herbal medicine Lithospermum erythrorhizon Sieb., exhibits an anti-inflammatory property towards rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but the potential mechanism is unclear. Our aim was to investigate the mechanism of shikonin on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced fibroblast-like synoviocyte (LiFLS) inflammation model. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) were treated with 200 mu g/ml of LPS for 24 h to establish the RA-like model, LiFLS. FLSs were pretreated with shikonin (0.1-1 mu M) for 30 min in the treatment groups. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to detect mRNA and protein levels of interleukin (IL)-10 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Signal proteins involved in IL-10 production were analyzed by Western blotting. Shikonin significantly reversed the inhibitory effects of LPS on IL-10 expression in FLSs by inactivating the PKC-NF-kappa B pathway. In addition, shikonin inhibited LPS-induced TNF-alpha expression in FLSs, and this effect was markedly diminished by IL-10-neutralizing antibody. The IL-10-mediated suppression of TNF-alpha transcription was demonstrated by no response to the protein synthesis inhibitor cyclohexamide and no mRNA decay. Shikonin inhibits LPS-induced TNF-alpha production in FLSs through suppressing the PKC-NF-kappa B-dependent decrease in IL-10, and this study also highlights the potential application of shikonin in the treatment of RA.",37
"A general synthesis procedure is given for a versatile signal flow graph realization of a general current transfer function by using multi-output second generation current controlled current conveyors (MO-CCCIIs). The proposed configuration uses n + 1 multi-output second generation cur-rent conveyors (MO-CCIIs), n capacitors and at most 2(n + 1) resistors. This number of resistors can be reduced to n for special cases. Using MO-CCCIIs instead of MO-CCIIs, the resistors can be removed completely for the nth-order universal structure. The general transfer function having any numerator dynamics can be derived from the universal structure by using a single MO-CCCII and at most n + I resistors. It is very easy to find the values of the passive elements from the coefficients of the transfer function to be realized. The validity of the proposed synthesis is verified through PSpice simulations. (C) 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.",56
"It is hypothesized that novel thiolated chitosan-coated multilayer microparticles (MPs) with enhanced drug loading are more mucoadhesive than uncoated MPs and safe in vivo for vaginal delivery of topical anti-HIV microbicide. Formulation optimization is achieved through a custom experimental design and the alginate (AG) MPs cores are prepared using the spray drying method. The optimal MPs are then coated with the thiolated chitosan (TCS) using a layer-by-layer method. The morphological analysis, in situ drug payload, in vitro drug release profile, and mucoadhesion potential of the MPs are carried out using scanning electron microscopy, solid-state P-31 NMR spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy, fluorescence imaging and periodic acid Schiff method, respectively. The cytotoxicity and preclinical safety of MPs are assessed on human vaginal (VK2/E6E7) and endocervical (End1/E6E7) epithelial cell lines and in female C57BL/6 mice, respectively. The results show that the MPs are successfully formulated with an average diameter ranging from 2 to 3 mu m with a drug loading of 7-12% w/w. The drug release profile of these MPs primarily follows the Baker-Lonsdale and Korsmeyer-Peppas models. The MPs exhibit high mucoadhesion (20-50 folds) compared to native AGMPs. The multilayer MPs are noncytotoxic. Histological and immunochemical analysis of the mice genital tract shows neither signs of damage nor inflammatory cell infiltrate. These data highlight the potential use of TCS-coated AG-based multilayer MPs templates for the topical vaginal delivery of anti-HIV/AIDS microbicides.",132

"Living walls (LW) are innovative Urban Greening systems that represent a promising tool for sustainable construction and bioclimatic design. LW use a growing media to support plant establishment and growth in a vertical plane. A drip irrigation system is mandatory to be installed to supply water and nutrients to plants. As the number of LW installed in urban areas is rapidly growing, it is important to conduct studies to optimize irrigation water use. This work has therefore two main objectives: (i) optimizing irrigation scheduling in a non-recirculating outdoor LW installed near Seville (SE Spain), and (ii) assessing LW daily water needs over the summer period. The experimental setup consisted of two 2x1 m multilayer LW modules with a plant density of 36 plants m(-2). Each module consisted of two geotextile layers sewn together and forming 15x15 cm pockets, and a waterproof layer facing the wall. The system is attached to the wall by means of a metal profile. The drip irrigation system consisted of a PE drip line placed in the upper part of the LW with drippers spaced 15 cm. Water losses by drainage (i.e. runoff) were collected with a semi-circular gutter placed at the bottom of each LW module. Both water applied and water lost by drainage were recorded for each irrigation event with a volumetric water meter and rain gauge, respectively. The main microclimatic variables (solar radiation, air temperature and relative humidity) were also recorded. The runoff hydrographs obtained for three different emitter discharge rates (2, 4 and 8 I/h), as well as the estimated LW water requirements are presented and discussed. The results indicate that, for lost solution systems, pulse drip irrigation is more suitable than applying irrigation times that maximize water distribution. Living Wall evapotranspiration was highly correlated with reference evaportranspiration, which allowed to derive a mean garden coefficient of 0.75.",93

"Background: We compared the effect of propofol and sevoflurane combined with remifentanil under comparable bispectral index (BIS) levels on transcranial electric motor-evoked potentials (TceMEPs) and somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEPs) during brainstem surgery. Materials and Methods: A total of 40 consecutive patients (20 per group) undergoing brainstem surgery were randomly assigned to 2 groups receiving either 0.5MAC sevoflurane or propofol at an effect-site concentration of 2.5 mu g/mL for maintenance of anesthesia. Remifentanil was administered to both groups at a rate of 0.25 to 0.35 mu g/kg/min along with cisatracurium (0.03 to 0.04 mg/kg/h). TceMEP recordings were carried out in the abductor pollicis brevis, abductor hallucis, and tibialis anterior muscles, whereas cortical SSEPs were measured with posterior tibial nerve stimulation. Amplitudes and latencies of TceMEPs and SSEPs were recorded at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after the induction of anesthesia. Results: BIS values remained in the 45 to 60 range. Amplitudes of TceMEPs were significantly higher in the propofol group than those in the sevoflurane group (P<0.05, at all study time points in abductor pollicis brevis and abductor hallucis muscles and only 4 h after anesthetic induction for tibialis anterior muscle), whereas latencies were shorter in the propofol group than those in the sevoflurane group (P < 0.05). No differences were observed in latency and amplitude while recording SSEPs between the 2 anesthetic techniques. None of the patients had TceMEPs and SSEPs amplitude or latency changes, exceeding our set limit. Conclusions: Both sevoflurane and propofol at low dosages combined with remifentanil under comparable BIS values and partial muscle relaxation can be used when monitoring of TceMEPs and SSEPs is required for brainstem surgery.",53
"The modeling and analysis of an electromechanically coupled typical aeroelastic section with shape memory alloy springs for wind energy harvesting is addressed in this paper. An airfoil with two-degrees-of-freedom, namely pitch and plunge, is considered and piezoelectric coupling is added to the plunge degree-of-freedom. A load resistance is assumed in the electrical domain of the problem in order to estimate the electrical power output. Shape memory alloy coil springs are modeled in the pitch degree-of-freedom of the typical section. A nickel-titanium alloy that exhibits pseudoelasticity at room temperature is assumed. The constitutive model for the shape memory alloy is based on classical phenomenological models. The unsteady aerodynamic loads are obtained by Jones' approximation to Wagner's indicial function. The resulting nonlinear electroaeroelastic model is cast into a state-space representation and solved with a Runge-Kutta method. The effects of preload values of the shape memory springs and resistive power generation on the aeroelastic behavior of the wind energy harvester are investigated at the flutter boundary and in a post-flutter regime. The nonlinear kinetics of the austenite-to-martensite phase transformation changes the typical linear flutter behavior to stable limit-cycle oscillations over a range of airflow speeds. Such nonlinear aeroelastic behavior introduced by the hysteretic behavior of the SMA springs provides an important source of persistent electrical power.",58
"Psychopathy is a complex developmental personality disorder. Recent theories have linked psychopathy to impairment in the frontostriatal circuitry linking the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Similar neural regions have been implicated in decision-making. Given the importance of decision-making in the context of personal and societal problems, together with the convergence of brain regions important in both decision-making and psychopathy, the study of decision-making in psychopathy has the potential to illuminate important cognitive and neurobiological bases for psychopathy. In this review, we synthesise past research on psychopathy and decision-making, and then describe three decision-making tasks that we predict would be useful for understanding cognitive decisional processes in psychopathy.",73
"In this paper, we present and evaluate a new approach to communicate with inter-integrated circuit (I2C) enabled circuits such as sensors over near field communication (NFC). The NFC-to-I2C interface was designed using a non-standard NFC command to control the I2C bus directly from a smartphone, which was controlling both, the read and write operations on the I2C bus. The NFC-to-I2C interface was reporting back the data bytes on the bus to the smartphone when the transaction was completed successfully. The proposed system was tested experimentally, both, with write and read requests to a commercial microcontroller featuring a hardware I2C port, as well as reading a commercial I2C enabled humidity and temperature sensor. We present experimental results of the system which show that our approach enables an easy interface between smartphones and external sensors. Interfacing external sensors is useful and beneficial for smartphone users, especially, if certain types of sensors are not available on smartphones.",51
"Abnormal telomere lengths have been linked to cancer and other hematologic disorders. Determination of mean telomere content (MTC) is traditionally performed by Southern blotting and densitometry, giving a mean telomere restriction fragment (TRF) value for the total cell population studied. Here, we compared a quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction approach (qPCR) and a flow cytometric approach, fluorescence in situ hybridization (Flow-FISH), to evaluate telomere content distribution in total patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells or specific cell populations. Flow-FISH is based on in situ hybridization using a fluorescein-labeled peptide nucleic acid (PNA) (CCCTAA)(3) probe and DNA staining with propidium iodide. We showed that both qPCR and Flow-FISH provide a robust measurement, with Flow-FISH measuring a relative content longer than qPCR at a single cell approach and that TRF2 fluorescence intensity did not correlate with MTC. Both methods showed comparable telomere content reduction with age, and the rate of relative telomere loss was similar. Published 2016 Wiley Periodicals Inc. This article is a US government work and, as such, is in the public domain in the United States of America.",39
"Mythimna separata walker (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is a polyphagous pest of nearly 100 families of more than 300 kinds of food and industrial crops. So far, both nucleotide and protein sequence information has been rarely available in database for M. separata, strictly limiting molecular biology research in this insect species. In this study, we carried out a transcriptome sequencing for M. separata. The sequencing and subsequent bioinformatics analysis yielded 69,238 unigenes, among which 45,227 unigenes were annotated to corresponding functions by blasting with high homologous genes in database, giving annotation rate of 65.32%. Several lepidopteran insects gave best matches with the transcriptome data. To gain insight into the mechanism of insecticide resistance in M. separata, 15 families of genes encoding insecticide resistance-related proteins were investigated. Substantial numbers of unigenes in these families were identified in the transcriptome data, and 17 out of 21 selected unigenes were successfully amplified. Expressions of most of these genes were detected at larval stages and in gut tissue, as was consistent with their putative involvement in insecticide resistance. Our study provides most comprehensive transcriptome data for M. separata to date, and also provides reference sequence information for other Noctuidae family insects.",30
"Pamela Ann Davies argues that the closure of the Lynemouth, UK, aluminum smelter generated adverse social justice impacts and was caused by the adoption of green state policies. She employs that argument to critique green criminology for promoting adverse social justice impacts. Here, we reanalyze the Lynemouth plant closure. First, this reanalysis illustrates the various social and environmental forms of injustice the plant generated, especially its adverse human, nonhuman and ecological health consequences. Second, the closure is reassessed from a political economic perspective that places the plant closure within the context of global capitalist plant closures in the aluminum industry. That review notes that plant closures and deindustrialization in developed economies are now a common occurrence driven by economic concerns, not environmental policies. We point out that social injustice as well as ecological destruction are often created by the normal operation of capitalism, and that those consequences should not be overlooked.",129
"Fibromyalgia is a common chronic pain condition that exerts a considerable impact on patients' daily activities and quality of life. Objectives: The main objective of the present study was to evaluate kinematic parameters of gait, functional performance, and balance in women with fibromyalgia syndrome. Methods: The study included 26 female patients with fibromyalgia (49.2 +/- 8.0 years) according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology, as well as 16 pain-free women (43.5 +/- 8.5 years). Gait and balance parameters were extracted from video recordings of participants performing several motor tasks. Non-linear dynamic of body sway time series was also analyzed by computing the Hurst exponent. In addition, functional performance and clinical pain were obtained by using standardized motor tests (Berg's balance scale, 6-min walking test, timed up and go task, Romberg's balance test) and self-report questionnaires (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire). Results: Walking speed was significantly diminished (p < 0.001) in FM patients as compared to Vain free controls, probably due to significant reductions in stride length (p 0.001) and cycle frequency (p < 0.001). Analyses of balance also revealed significant differences between fibromyalgia and pain-free controls on body sway in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior axes (all ps < 0.01). Several parameters of gait and balance were significantly associated with high levels of pain, depression, stiffness, anxiety, and fatigue in fibromyalgia. Conclusion: Our data revealed that both gait and balance were severely impaired in FM, and that subjective complaints associated with FM could contribute to functional disability in these patients. These findings suggest that optimal rehabilitation and fall prevention in fibromyalgia require a comprehensive assessment of both psychological responses to pain and physical impairments during postural control and gait.",0
"The article proposes optimal secondary controller for combined Load Frequency Control (LFC) and Automatic Voltage Regulation (AVR) of multi source multi area system using simulated annealing technique. When subjected to load disturbance, frequency, tie-line power and voltage fluctuations results higher oscillations. Speed governor of the system helps to match generation with the demand. But, fine tuning of frequency, tie-line power and voltage when subjected to load disturbance in multi source multi area system is achieved by secondary Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller. As a conventional benchmark PID controller is tuned using Zeigler Nichol's (ZN) method and further optimized using Simulated Annealing (SA) technique. The performance of the system is validated and judged using performance indices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",59
"Wildfires have significant effects on human populations, economically, environmentally, and in terms of their general well-being. Smoke pollution, in particular, from either prescribed burns or uncontrolled wildfires, can have significant health impacts. Some estimates suggest that smoke dispersion from fire events may affect the health of one in three residents in the United States, leading to an increased incidence of respiratory illnesses such as asthma and pulmonary disease. Scarcity in the measurements of particulate matter responsible for these public health issues makes addressing the problem of smoke dispersion challenging, especially when fires occur in remote regions. Crowdsourced data have become an essential component in addressing other societal problems (e.g., disaster relief, traffic congestion) but its utility in monitoring air quality impacts of wildfire events is unexplored. In this study, we assessed if user-generated social media content can be used as a complementary source of data in measuring particulate pollution from wildfire smoke. We found that the frequency of daily tweets within a 40,000km(2) area was a significant predictor of PM2.5 levels, beyond daily and geographic variation. These results suggest that social media can be a valuable tool for the measurement of air quality impacts of wildfire events, particularly in the absence of data from physical monitoring stations. Also, an analysis of the semantic content in people's tweets provided insight into the socio-psychological dimensions of fire and smoke and their impact on people residing in, working in, or otherwise engaging with affected areas.",109
"Objectives. We aimed to investigate the early changes in expression of C-type lectin domain family 9, member A (CLEC9A), a C-type lectin that is specifically expressed by the CD141(+) dendritic cell subset that is involved in cross-presentation to CD8(+) T cells, by evaluating gene and/or protein expression in three different compartments [skin, synovial tissue (ST) and serum] after short-term adalimumab treatment in PsA patients compared with placebo. Methods. Patients with active PsA and psoriasis were randomized to receive adalimumab or placebo for 4 weeks. Synovial and skin biopsies were obtained before and after 4 weeks of treatment and serum samples 4 weeks, 12 weeks and 1 year after treatment. Skin and serum from healthy donors were used as control. CLEC9A expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry, double immunofluorescence using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase 2'-deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nick-end labelling (TUNEL), quantitative PCR and ELISA. Results. CLEC9A expression was significantly higher in psoriatic skin compared with healthy donor. In psoriatic skin and PsA ST, CLEC9A(+) cells were in close proximity to TUNEL+ cells. SF CLEC9A levels were significantly lower compared with paired PsA serum. Adalimumab treatment did not affect CLEC9A serum level and skin expression. However, ST CLEC9A protein expression was significantly decreased after adalimumab treatment compared with the placebo group while CLEC9A gene expression remained unchanged. There was a positive correlation between T cell numbers and ST CLEC9A protein expression. CD141(+) cell numbers and chemokine (C motif) receptor 1 expression were not affected with adalimumab treatment. Conclusion. Altogether, the present study suggests that the downregulation of synovial CLEC9A might be associated with a novel mechanism by which anti-TNF therapy might reduce CD8-mediated inflammation in PsA patients.",22
"In this paper, we investigate the inhomogeneous reduced Maxwell-Bloch system, which describes the propagation of the intense ultra-short optical pulses through an inhomogeneous two-level dielectric medium. Through symbolic computation, the integrability aspects including the Painleve integrable condition, Lax pair and infinite conservation laws are derived. By virtue of the Darboux transformation method, one- and two-soliton solutions are generated on the nonvanishing background, including the bright solitons, dark solitons, periodic solutions and some two-soliton solutions. The asymptotic analysis method is performed to verify the elastic interaction between two solitons. Furthermore, by virtue of some figures, the dynamic properties of those solitons are discussed. The results may be useful in the study of the ultrashort pulses propagation in such situations as the model of the two-level dielectric media.",24
"Purpose Cilostazol (Pletal), a phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor, was approved in the United States in 1999 to reduce symptoms of intermittent claudication. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels increase from inhibition of phosphodiesterase resulting in anti-platelet, anti-inflammatory, and vasodilatory effects. Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that causes endothelial and platelet dysfunction leading to both microvascular and macrovascular complications. This mini-review highlights the emerging evidence suggesting benefits of using cilostazol in treating microvascular complications associated with diabetes mellitus. Methods A review of literature was conducted using PubMed and Embase databases focusing on cilostazol use in diabetes mellitus. Results Cilostazol demonstrated renoprotective effects in patients with diabetic nephropathy by reducing serum soluble adhesion molecule-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. Cilostazol's anti-inflammatory actions predictably attenuate glomerular damage from increased leukocyte adherence. Additionally, cilostazol delayed renal dysfunction secondary to type 2 diabetes mellitus as albuminuria was reduced most likely resulting from inhibition of nuclear factor kappa-induced inflammatory and endothelial markers. Cilostazol's anti-inflammatory actions in addition to its vasodilatory actions relieved retinal hypoxia and decreased excessive production of retinal blood vessels suggesting benefit in diabetic retinopathy. Cilostazol did not improve neuropathy symptom scores signifying that it may not be as beneficial in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy without diabetic nephropathy or diabetic retinopathy. Conclusions Cilostazol's pleiotropic effects may be beneficial in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy. Additional, larger studies need to be conducted to assess the benefits and risks of using cilostazol as an alternative agent in treating patients with diabetic microvascular complications.",120
"As of 2012, liver cancer was the second leading cause of death worldwide, and hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary cancer of the liver. The identification of molecules that might be molecular markers or therapeutic targets is urgently needed to improve clinical management. Based on a microarray analysis performed in our laboratory, we selected six genes-namely, ANXA2, DYNLT1, PFKP, PLA2G7, KRT19, and SNX10-as candidates for validation as tumor markers of liver cancer in a rat model. Their patterns of overexpression in preneoplastic lesions and established tumors at 10 different time points between 24 h and 18 months were analyzed to identify putative tumor markers for further studies. We validated the microarray results by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, which revealed high transcriptional expression for five of the genes, consistent with their high protein expression during cancer progression reported in the literature. However, studies of the association of sorting nexin 10 with different types of cancer are limited, prompting further study. The characterization of sorting nexin 10 in preneoplastic lesions and established tumors revealed messenger RNA overexpression and a simultaneous decrease in sorting nexin 10 protein expression. A group of microRNAs related to sorting nexin 10 messenger RNA were selected based on a data analysis conducted using miRDB and microrna.org. An analysis of the expression of these microRNAs revealed an increase in the transcription of microRNA-30d whenever the sorting nexin 10 protein was downregulated. These results suggest that sorting nexin 10 is a potential liver cancer marker exhibiting characteristics of a putative suppressor protein that is likely regulated by microRNA-30d.",37
"Background: In-patient suicide prevention is a high priority in many countries, but its practice remains poorly understood. Patients in a suicidal crisis who receive psychiatric care can provide valuable insight into understanding and improving patient safety. The aim of this paper was therefore to summarize the qualitative literature regarding suicidal patients' in-patient care experiences. The following question guided the review: How can we describe suicidal patients' experiences regarding safety during psychiatric in-patient care? Methods: Systematic searches were conducted in the MEDLINE, Academic Search Premier, CINAHL, SOCINDEX and PsycINFO databases, identifying 20 qualitative studies on suicidal patients and their psychiatric in-patient care experiences. These studies were systematically reviewed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, synthesized via thematic analysis and subjected to quality appraisals. Results: Patients described safety as ""feeling safe"", and three components, i.e., connection, protection and control, were vital to their experiences of safety. Fulfilling these needs was essential to patients recovering from suicidal crises, feeling safe during encounters with health care professionals and feeling safe from suicidal impulses. Unmet needs for connection, protection and control left patients feeling unsafe and increased their suicidal behaviour. Conclusion: Our review addresses the importance of adopting a wider perspective of patient safety than considering safety solely in technical and physical terms. Safety for the suicidal patient is highly dependent on patients' perceptions of their psychological safety and the fulfilment of their needs. The three patient-identified factors mentioned above - connection, protection and control - should be considered an integral part of patient safety practices and should form the basis of future efforts to understand the safety of suicidal patients during psychiatric in-patient care.",70
"Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is considered predominantly as a non-thermal ablative technique that uses electrical fields to permeabilize cell membranes and lead to cell death. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of IRE in the rabbit VX2 breast cancer model. Thirty-five female New Zealand white rabbits were inoculated against VX2 breast cancer cells. The rabbits were randomly divided into two groups: a control group of 15 rabbits and an IRE treatment group of 20 rabbits. Treatment and treatment outcome were evaluated by computerized tomography (CT) scan (plain or contrast enhanced), tumor growth curves and pathological examination including H& E, TUNEL, PCNA and CD31 staining. All rabbits in the IRE treatment group experienced successful IRE without obvious complications except for thoracic major muscle injury. A focused, complete and well-defined ablation zone where tumor cells have been thoroughly eradicated was detected by H& E staining, along with increasing TUNEL staining. The expression of PCNA and CD31 was down-regulated at the periphery of the ablation region. As of the last follow-up, 10 rabbits (67%) in IRE group demonstrated disease is under control; 2 rabbits (13%) are in stable condition; 3 rabbits (20%) suffered from disease progression; the remaining 5 rabbits were sacrificed for pathological examination halfway through the study. Overall, the efficacy of IRE was demonstrated by the creation of a complete ablation region, with increased apoptosis in the ablation zone and decreased proliferation and microvessel density of tumor tissue at the periphery. IRE is a promising local treatment for breast cancer.",14
"Modeling of scientific or engineering applications often yields high-dimensional dynamical systems due to techniques of computer-aided-design, for example. Thus a model order reduction is required to decrease the dimensionality and to enable an efficient numerical simulation. In addition, methods of parameterized model order reduction (pMOR) are often used to preserve the physical or geometric parameters as independent variables in the reduced order models. We consider linear dynamical systems in the form of ordinary differential equations. In the domain of the parameters, often samples are chosen to construct a reduced order model. For each sample point a common technique for model order reduction can be applied to compute a local basis. Moment matching or balanced truncation are feasible, for example. A global basis for pMOR can be constructed from the local bases by a singular value decomposition. We investigate approaches for an appropriate selection of a finite set of samples. The transfer function of the dynamical system is examined in the frequency domain, and our focus is on moment matching techniques using the Arnoldi procedure. We use a sensitivity analysis of the transfer function with respect to the parameters as a tool to select sample points. Simulation results are shown for two examples. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"Presently, medications approved for children with Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) are extremely limited. This is especially the case for children under 12 years of age. For this reason we reviewed and summarized the data on treatment of children with HAE. Available data indicate that plasma derived C1-inhibitor is a safe, effective treatment option for HAE in pediatric patients, including those below 12 years of age. Other therapies are also appear safe for the under 12 year of age, but less data are available. Importantly, home-based treatment of HAE in this age group appears to be safe and effective and can improve quality of life. These findings support current HAE consensus guidelines which strongly recommend the use of plasma derived C1-inhibitor as a first-line treatment in children and encourage home and self-treatment.",131
"Growing global awareness of climate change has ushered in a new era demanding policy, financial and behavioural innovations to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy. Dramatic price decreases in solar photovoltaics (PV) and public policy have underwritten the expansion of solar power, now accounting for the largest share of renewable energy in California and rising fast in other countries, such as Germany and Italy. Governments' efforts to expand solar generation base and integrate it into municipal, regional, and national energy systems, have spawned several programs that require rigorous policy evaluations to assess their effectiveness, costs and contribution to Paris Agreement's goals. In this study, we exploit a natural experiment in northern California to test the capacity of Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) to promote PV investment. PACE has been highly cost effective by more than doubling residential PV installations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",100
"Withdrawn/depressed behavior (WD) as defined by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) relates to various outcomes in developmental psychopathology such as depression, pervasive developmental disorders, and suicide. We sought to examine the temperamental characteristics of children who concurrently endorse symptoms of WD. Junior Temperament and Characteristic Inventory (JTCI) and CBCL data were collected from 397 children's parents in a family study in the northeastern United States. Linear mixed models were used to test the relations between WD and temperament dimensions (Novelty Seeking, Harm Avoidance, Reward Dependence, Persistence) on the JTCI, while controlling for age, sex, item overlap, and co-occurring aggression and attention problems. When controlling for definitional artifact and CBCL aggressive behavior and attention scores, high harm avoidance and low reward dependence were both significant predictors of childhood withdrawn behavior.

"We investigated the contribution of monitoring processes to the emergence of false memories in children. Two age groups were compared, assuming lower monitoring ability at preschool age compared with older children. We also manipulated whether elementary school pupils responded in the memory test with or without time pressure. Furthermore, the frequency of list presentation was manipulated within participants. We found that presenting lists thrice compared with only once increased the number of false memories in kindergarten children and in elementary school pupils responding under time pressure but reduced false memories in elementary school pupils responding without time pressure. These findings indicate that kindergarten children still lack the ability to monitor the source of the activation of critical items of Deese-Roediger-McDermott lists. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

"Objective: This study used the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework to evaluate a promotora-led community health program designed for Latinas ages 50 and older that sought to improve physical activity, nutrition, and stress management. Method: A mixed-methods evaluation approach was administered at participant and organizational levels with a focus on the efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance components of the RE-AIM theoretical model. Results: The program was shown to be effective at improving participants' eating behaviors, increasing their physical activity levels, and lowering their depressive symptoms. Promotoras felt motivated and sufficiently prepared to deliver the program. Some implementation challenges were reported. More child care opportunities and an increased focus on mental well-being were suggested. Discussion: The promotora delivery model has promise for program sustainability with both promotoras and participants alike expressing interest in leading future programs.",120
"The present cross-sectional study performed using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 9526 women older than 18 years of age demonstrates that high sodium intake is associated with lower bone mineral density and sodium intake a 2000 mg/day is a risk factor for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Several studies have reported that large amount of dietary sodium intake is highly associated with elevated urinary calcium. However, the direct effect of excessive dietary sodium intake on bone mass, as a risk factor for osteoporosis, is still a controversial issue. The aim of the present study was to assess the relationship between high intake of sodium and lower bone mass and risk of osteoporosis in adult women. This cross-sectional study was performed using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES), 2008-2011. Participants (n = 9526 women older than 18 years) were divided into a premenopausal (n = 4793) and postmenopausal (n = 4733) group. Both groups were subdivided into five groups according to quintiles of energy-adjusted sodium intake. Multiple regression analysis was performed to assess relationships between sodium intake and lower bone mass. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that high sodium intake was negatively associated with bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women. After adjusting confounding factors, high sodium intake was negatively associated with BMC and BMD of the lumbar spine in postmenopausal women. Postmenopausal women, whose sodium intake was a 2000 mg/day (odds ratio 1.284, 95% CI 1.029-1.603, P = 0.027), were at risk of developing osteoporosis after adjustment of confounding variables. The present study suggested that high sodium intake could be a potential risk factor for low bone mass after adjusting for confounding factors in postmenopausal women.",9
"Whether total joint replacement (TJR) patients are susceptible to postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) remains unclear due to inconsistencies in research methodologies. Moreover, cognitive reserve may moderate the development of POCD after TJR, but has not been investigated in this context. The current study investigated POCD after TJR, and its relationship with cognitive reserve, using a more rigorous methodology than has previously been utilized. Fifty-three older adults (aged 50+) scheduled for TJR were assessed pre and post surgery (6months). Forty-five healthy controls matched for age, gender, and premorbid IQ were re-assessed after an equivalent interval. Cognition, cognitive reserve, and physical and mental health were all measured. Standardized regression-based methods were used to assess cognitive changes, while controlling for the confounding effect of repeated cognitive testing. TJR patients only demonstrated a significant decline in Trail Making Test Part B (TMT B) performance, compared to controls. Cognitive reserve only predicted change in TMT B scores among a subset of TJR patients. Specifically, patients who showed the most improvement pre to post surgery had significantly higher reserve than those who showed the greatest decline. The current study provides limited evidence of POCD after TJR when examined using a rigorous methodology, which controlled for practice effects. Cognitive reserve only predicted performance within a subset of the TJR sample. However, the role of reserve in more cognitively compromised patients remains to be determined.",69
"Health services research uses increasingly data from health insurance funds. It is well known that the funds differ with regard to sociodemographic characteristics and morbidity. It is uncertain if there are also differences in the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders. To compare the sociodemographic characteristics in various health insurance funds and the prevalence of joint disorders and chronic back pain. The 30(th) wave (2013) of the German Socioeconomic Panel served as a database. Average age, sex distribution, nationality, education, and employment status were evaluated according to the health insurance funds. The prevalence of joint disorders and chronic back pain were also stratified according to the insurance funds and standardized according to age and sex. A total of 19,146 participants were included. Most participants (4,934) were insured by AOK, followed by BKK (2,632) and BARMER GEK (2,398). There were huge differences among the health insurance funds with regard to the sociodemographic characteristics. For example, the proportion of unemployed insurants was between 33.3 % (IKK) and 50.6 % (AOK). The prevalence of joint disorders standardized according to age and sex (20.7 %; 95 % CI: 20.1-21.3) was between 17.4 % (95 % CI: 15.8-19.0; PKV) and 22.4 % (95 % CI: 21.1-23.6; AOK). The prevalence of chronic back pain (18.0 %; 95 % CI: 17.4-18.5) was between 13.5 % (95 % CI: 12.2-14.9; PKV) and 20.6 % (95 % CI: 19.4-21.8; AOK). There are differences in the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders among health insurance funds. The extrapolation of analyses of one health insurance fund to the German population is thus limited.",23
"Background. The aim of this comparative study was to evaluate the clinical radiological outcome after open treatment of acute anterior glenoid rim fractures and to analyze the influencing factors and complications. Patients and methods. The study included 26 patients with an average age of 51.6 years (range 27-71 years) at surgery. The mean period of follow-up was 5.1 years (range 2.0-11.1 years). The average extent of glenoid fracture involvement was 25.5 % (range 18-35%) and three fixation techniques were applied: 1) bioresorbable pins (n = 16), 2) small fragment screws (n = 5) and 3) bioresorbable suture anchors (n = 5). Results. The mean score values were 80.3 points for the absolute Constant score, 87.6 points for the normalized Constant score, 88.7 points for the Rowe score, 17.4 points for the Oxford shoulder score, 10.3 points for the simple shoulder test, 13.0 points for the shoulder pain and disability index and 81.5 % for the subjective shoulder value. The fixation technique did not show a significant influence; however, multi-fragment fractures were associated with a significantly inferior absolute (73 vs. 87 points, p = 0.022) and normalized Constant scores (81 vs. 94 points, p = 0.019). Subscapularis insufficiency with internal rotation deficit was found in 10 (39 %) patients and posttraumatic osteoarthritis occurred in 6 (23 %) patients. Conclusion. Open fixation yielded good or excellent shoulder function in 20 out of the 26 (77 %) patients and the clinical outcome primarily depended on the underlying type of fracture. Significantly inferior outcomes should be expected in patients with multi-fragment fractures. The main complications were subscapularis insufficiency and posttraumatic osteoarthritis.",15
"HCCI (homogeneous charge compression ignition) combustion offers both high efficiency and very low NOx and particulate matter emissions. However, the operating range of HCCI engines is limited by an excessive PRR (pressure rise rate) in high load region, which is the main reason of engine knock. For this problem shown in HCCI combustion, ignition timing should be retarded after TDC (top dead center) by controlling gas temperature properly, and in addition, combustion duration also needs to be ensured adequately. EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) gas is known to have impacts on the history of gas temperature, and the objective of this study is to investigate the influence of EGR ratio on combustion characteristics. The computational modeling work is conducted by using a single-zone code with detailed chemical kinetics. Then, in order to investigate the influence of EGR ratio and the engine speed, contribution matrix has been used to extract important reaction paths from a reaction mechanism. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Modern heuristics or metaheuristics are optimization algorithms that have been increasingly used during the last decades to support complex decision-making in a number of fields, such as logistics and transportation, telecommunication networks, bioinformatics, finance, and the like. The continuous increase in computing power, together with advancements in metaheuristics frameworks and parallelization strategies, are empowering these types of algorithms as one of the best alternatives to solve rich and real-life combinatorial optimization problems that arise in a number of financial and banking activities. This article reviews some of the works related to the use of metaheuristics in solving both classical and emergent problems in the finance arena. A non-exhaustive list of examples includes rich portfolio optimization, index tracking, enhanced indexation, credit risk, stock investments, financial project scheduling, option pricing, feature selection, bankruptcy and financial distress prediction, and credit risk assessment. This article also discusses some open opportunities for researchers in the field, and forecast the evolution of metaheuristics to include real-life uncertainty conditions into the optimization problems being considered.",42
"This band electromagnetic hybrid absorber (HA) for the radar cross section (RCS) reduction of antennas. The proposed HA is based on the design of a metamaterial structure coated with the synthesized dielectric absorber material. The dielectric filler based composite absorber is fabricated by optimizing weight percentage of graphite and glass microballoon powders mixed into an epoxy medium. The proposed HA shows minimum-10 dB reflection loss (RL) in the 6-12 GHz frequency region having maximum absorption of 99.56% (-20 dB RL) at 9.26 GHz. The proposed HA is ultimately loaded onto a wide band antenna in order to reduce the in-band RCS of the antenna. The simulated and the experimental results show remarkable RCS reduction of the antenna over the full operating frequency range. It is also observed that the antenna characteristics, e.g., the gain and the radiation pattern remain almost preserved after loading the antenna with HA. The significant RCS reduction capability of the proposed HA shows that it has the potential applications for RF stealth technology.",98
"Multimodal damping can be achieved by coupling a mechanical structure to an electrical network exhibiting similar modal properties. Focusing on a plate, a new topology for such an electrical analogue is found from a finite difference approximation of the Kirchhoff-Love theory and the use of the direct electromechanical analogy. Discrete models based on element dynamic stiffness matrices are proposed to simulate square plate unit cells coupled to their electrical analogues through two-dimensional piezoelectric transducers. A setup made of a clamped plate covered with an array of piezoelectric patches is built in order to validate the control strategy and the numerical models. The analogous electrical network is implemented with passive components as inductors, transformers and the inherent capacitance of the piezoelectric patches. The effect of the piezoelectric coupling on the dynamics of the clamped plate is significant as it creates the equivalent of a multimodal tuned mass damping. An adequate tuning of the network then yields a broadband vibration reduction. In the end, the use of an analogous electrical network appears as an efficient solution for the multimodal control of a plate.",50
"The digital low dropout regulator (D-LDO) has drawn significant attention recently for its low-voltage operation and process-scalability. However, the D-LDO inherently suffers from limit cycle oscillation (LCO). To address this issue, the modes and amplitudes of LCO are calculated in this work and verified by SPICE simulation in a 65-nm CMOS process. An LCO reduction technique for the D-LDO is then proposed, by adding two unit power transistors in parallel with the main power MOS array as a feedforward path. This technique sets the LCO mode to 1 and effectively reduces the ripple amplitude for a wide (0.5-20 mA) load current range. When compared with the dead-zone scheme, this technique minimizes LCO with negligible circuit complexity and design difficulty.",48
"Human genetic studies are continuing to increase in size and scale, but the availability of well-phenotyped longitudinal cohorts remains rare. Significant infrastructure, investment and effort are required to establish and maintain high-quality cohorts with biobanking, genetic consent and repeated clinical data measurements. Australia currently has two such cohorts established by Monash University as part of community-based clinical trials in the elderly. Both studies involve capture of demographic, mood, cognitive performance, physical function, neuroimaging, audiometry and various clinical data types over an average of 5years. The ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) cohort is comprised of 16703 Australians aged over 70years and 2411 Americans aged over 65years - recruited and randomised to either daily low-dose aspirin or placebo to examine the preventative benefit of aspirin on a range of clinical outcomes. The STAtins in Reducing Events in the Elderly (STAREE) study uses a similar model, and is currently recruiting 10000 men and women aged over 70years across Australia randomised to either low-dose statins or placebo. Both cohorts involve biobanking and consent for genetic research, with recruitment through a network of general practitioners in the community. A combination of whole-genome and targeted sequencing approaches will allow gene-phenotype relationships to be explored within the context of detailed longitudinal data. Genetic risk factors for late-onset high-burden conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and dementia will be investigated, plus research into other areas, such as healthy ageing and disease resilience will be possible due to unique phenotypes of health.",34
"In this work, the interaction of an aspirin (AS) molecule with the external surface of a boron nitride fullerene-like nanocage (B12N12) is studied by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Equilibrium geometry, electronic properties, adsorption energy and thermodynamic stability are identified for all of the adsorbed configurations. Four stable configurations are obtained for the interaction of AS molecule with the B12N12 nanocage, with adsorption energies in the range of -10.1 to -37.7 kcal/mol (at the M06-2X/6-31 + G** level). Our results clearly indicate that Al-doping of the B12N12 tends to increase the adsorption energy and thermodynamic stability of AS molecule over this nanocage. We further study the adsorption of AS over the B12N12 and B11N12Al in the presence of a protic (water) or aprotic (benzene) solvent. It is found that the calculated binding distances and adsorption energies by the PCM and CPCM solvent models are very similar, especially for the B12N12 complexes. According to time-dependent DFT calculations, the Al-doping can shift estimated lambda (max) values toward longer wavelengths (redshift). Solvent effects also have an important influence on the calculated electronic absorption spectra of AS-B12N12 complexes.",14
"Introduction: Endodontics uses cell therapy strategies to treat pulpal and periapical diseases. During these therapies, surgeons aim to reconstruct the natural microenvironments that regulate the activity of dental stem cells. Methods: We searched for more than 400 articles in PubMed using key words from regenerative endodontics and dental stem cell biology. In 268 articles, we reviewed what factors may influence histologic results after preclinical dental treatments that use regenerative endodontic procedures after pulpectomy. Results: Several factors, such as the origin of stem cells, the biomimicry of scaffolds used, and the size of lesions, are considered to influence the histologic appearance of the regenerated pulp-dentin complex after treatments. Information is accumulating on transcription factors that generate the pulp-dentin complex and survival/trophic factors that would benefit niche recovery and histologic results. Conclusions: In this article, we discuss the noninterchangeability of stem cells, the influence of dentin-entrapped molecule release on pulp regeneration and survival of stem cells, and the need of positional markers to assess treatments histologically. The ex vivo amplification of appropriate dental stem cells, the search for scaffolds storing the molecular diversity entrapped in the dentin, and the use of positional transcription factors as histologic markers are necessary to improve future preclinical experiments.",31
"Due to that conventional teaching method mainly focus on the impartment and the memorization of knowledge points, the initiative of student cannot be activated and there is still substantial room for improving the professional abilities, including independent learning ability and problem solving capability, hands-on practical ability, etc. Aiming at improving the teaching results of computer programming courses, a practical mode of classroom instruction with diverse collaboration is proposed in this paper. In this teaching mode, the theoretical teaching and learning is closely integrated with professional practice, opening lab problems and scientific research project. The course assessment emphasizes the project evaluation instead of paper test for proper evaluation of actual practice level of students.",40
"In this paper, we propose a non-cooperative differential game theory based resource allocation approach for the network security risk assessment. For the risk assessment, the resource will be used for risk assess, including response cost and response negative cost. The whole assessment process is considered as a differential game for optimal resource control. The proposed scheme can be obtained through the Nash Equilibrium. It is proved that the game theory based algorithm is applicable and the optimal resource level can be achieved based on the proposed algorithm.",46
"Objectives. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a subtype of recurrent unipolar or bipolar depressive disorder with a higher prevalence in winter than in summer. The biological underpinnings of SAD are so far poorly understood. Studies examining SAD have found disturbances between the molecular and connectivity scales. The aim of the study was to explore changes in functional connectivity typical for SAD. Methods. We investigated unmedicated, untreated SAD patients and healthy controls using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) utilizing graph theory, a data driven and hypothesis free approach, to model functional networks of the brain. Results. Comparing whole brain network properties using graph theory we observed globally affected network topologies with increasing pathlength in SAD. Nodal changes, however, were highly restricted to bilateral inferior occipital cortex. Interestingly, we found a lateralization where hyper-connectedness was restricted to right inferior occipital cortex and hyper-efficiency was found in the left inferior occipital cortex. Furthermore, we found these nodes became more ""hub like"" in patients, suggesting a greater functional role. Conclusions. Our work stresses the importance of abnormal intrinsic processing during rest, primarily affecting visual areas and subsequently changing whole brain networks, and thus providing an important hint towards potential future therapeutic approaches.",71
"Despite its enormous empirical success, the formalism of quantum theory still raises fundamental questions: why is nature described in terms of complex Hilbert spaces, and what modifications of it could we reasonably expect to find in some regimes of physics? Here we address these questions by studying how compatibility with thermodynamics constrains the structure of quantum theory. We employ two postulates that any probabilistic theory with reasonable thermodynamic behaviour should arguably satisfy. In the framework of generalised probabilistic theories, we show that these postulates already imply important aspects of quantum theory, like self-duality and analogues of projective measurements, subspaces and eigenvalues. However, they may still admit a class of theories beyond quantum mechanics. Using a thought experiment by von Neumann, we show that these theories admit a consistent thermodynamic notion of entropy, and prove that the second law holds for projective measurements and mixing procedures. Furthermore, we study additional entropy-like quantities based on measurement probabilities and convex decomposition probabilities, and uncover a relation between one of these quantities and Sorkin's notion of higher-order interference.",88
"ObjectiveTo examine the association between 10-year temporal changes in the primary care workforce and Medicare beneficiaries' outcomes. Data Sources2001 and 2011 American Medical Association Masterfiles and fee-for-service Medicare claims. Study Design/MethodsWe calculated two primary care workforce measures within Primary Care Service Areas: the number of primary care physicians per 10,000 population (per capita) and the number of Medicare primary care full-time equivalents (FTEs) per 10,000 Medicare beneficiaries. The three outcomes were mortality, ambulatory care-sensitive condition (ACSC) hospitalizations, and emergency department (ED) visits. We measured the marginal association between changes in primary care workforce and patient outcomes using Poisson regression models. Principal FindingsAn increase of one primary care physician per 10,000 population was associated with 15.1 fewer deaths per 100,000 and 39.7 fewer ACSC hospitalizations per 100,000 (both p<.05). An increase of one Medicare primary care FTE per 10,000 beneficiaries was associated with 82.8 fewer deaths per 100,000, 160.8 fewer ACSC hospitalizations per 100,000, and 712.3 fewer ED visits per 100,000 (all p<.05). ConclusionsMedicare beneficiaries' outcomes improved as the number of primary care physicians and their clinical effort increased.",8
"Tree shadowing is significant for mobile satellite radio propagation investigation and must be known for successful link design. Therefore, there are limited data on the relevant problem. For this purpose, propagation measurements at L and UHF band were performed in Trabzon, Turkey, in 1993 and 1996, respectively. These experiments were executed with a transmitter on the top of a high building, and the receiver system was located in a van outfitted with the antenna on its roof and receiver equipment in its interior. Measurements were carried out for 14 different tree types, and the results of both bands are presented in tabular and graphical forms. Experiments were repeated for the same trees during the months April to September. The variations of the tree attenuation were examined during these months with and without foliage. Average values of the tree attenuations were found to be 8.60 and 11.00 dB for UHF and L band, respectively. The scaling factor between L and UHF band attenuations in decibels was determined to be approximately 1.32. Using these measured parameters, fade depth statistics were calculated using a lognormal shadowing model. To establish validity of obtained results for the design of mobile satellite links, the results were compared with previous investigations.",54
"This study relies on double-sided chips where capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers (cMUT) are manufactured on both sides of a silicon substrate in order to perform galvanic isolation between two electrical circuits. The operating principle is based on the propagation of acoustic waves from one transducer to the other, providing a high level of electrical isolation. The work presented here focuses mainly on the assessment of the power efficiency, from an experimental and from a theoretical point of view. Encouraging power efficiency values were reached, showing a significant efficiency gain when taking advantage of the coupling with the substrate.",45
"To investigate the microbial quality of retail pepper in Vietnam, the enumeration and detection of Enterobacteriaceae and the screening of cefotaxime (CTX)-resistant coliforms were performed by using 84 commercial samples. Although Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from 78 samples, the number of Enterobacteriaceae was lower than 1.0 log CFU/g in 46 samples. For the detection of Enterobacteriaceae with the International Organization for Standardization methods, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Cronobacter sakazakii, and Enterobacter cloacae complex were isolated from 5, 12, 36, 19, and 30 samples, respectively. During screening of CTX-resistant coliforms, K. pneumoniae, C. sakazakii, and E. cloacae complex were isolated from 8, 1, and 21 samples, respectively. Seven K. pneumoniae and seven E. cloacae complex isolates obtained in the screening of CTX-resistant coliforms were resistant to at least one of the three third-generation cephalosporins (CTX, ceftazidime, and cefpodoxime). Moreover, one E. cloacae complex cluster IV and all K. pneumoniae isolates were positive for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes or plasmid-mediated AmpC P-lactamase genes or both. Additionally, two extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae isolates and one AmpC beta-lactamase-producing E. cloacae complex cluster IV isolate were positive for the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants and also had amino acid alterations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions of GyrA and ParC. Furthermore, 10 E. cloacae complex isolates were positive for the plasmid-mediated fosfomycin resistance gene fosA. As pepper is often consumed without a heating process, the possible spread to humans of foodborne, opportunistic, and nosocomial infection pathogens or resistance genes from foods prepared or seasoned with pepper cannot be excluded. Therefore, it is necessary to handle pepper by using hygienic conditions during the cultivation, harvesting and processing steps.",37
"Introduction: Adalimumab, an inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), is the only systemic non-corticosteroid agent which has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of non-infectious uveitis.Areas covered: The aim of this review is to summarize the research which demonstrated the effectiveness of adalimumab in the treatment of intraocular inflammation and helped to establish its side effect profile, ultimately leading to its FDA approval.Expert commentary: Adalimumab is a useful second-line agent in the treatment of non-infectious uveitis.

"Extreme degree of parallelism in high-end computing requires low operating system noise so that large scale, bulk-synchronous parallel applications can be run efficiently. Noiseless execution has been historically achieved by deploying lightweight kernels (LWK), which, on the other hand, can provide only a restricted set of the POSIX API in exchange for scalability. However, the increasing prevalence of more complex application constructs, such as in-situ analysis and workflow composition, dictates the need for the rich programming APIs of POSIX/Linux. In order to comply with these seemingly contradictory requirements, hybrid kernels, where Linux and a lightweight kernel (LWK) are run side-by-side on compute nodes, have been recently recognized as a promising approach. Although multiple research projects are now pursuing this direction, the questions of how node resources are shared between the two types of kernels, how exactly the two kernels interact with each other and to what extent they are integrated, remain subjects of ongoing debate. In this paper, we describe IHK/McKernel, a hybrid software stack that seamlessly blends an LWK with Linux by selectively offloading system services from the lightweight kernel to Linux. Specifically, we are focusing on transparent reuse of Linux device drivers and detail the design of our framework that enables the LWK to naturally leverage the Linux driver code-base without sacrificing scalability or the POSIX API. Through rigorous evaluation on a medium size cluster we demonstrate how McKernel provides consistent, isolated performance for simulations even in face of competing, in-situ workloads.",68
"Competing for food by altricial and semiprecocial bird nestlings is a behaviour well known for its sensitivity to maternal androgens during prenatal development. Whether a similar effect is present in precocial species that do not beg is less well known. We therefore increased yolk testosterone levels within the physiological range at the onset of incubation to study its effects on food competition behaviour in the domestic chicken, Gallus gallus domesticus. We found an increase in competitiveness in testosterone-treated male domestic chicks, raising their level to that of the females. This is in line with the decrease in circulating plasma levels of males in the direction of the levels in females, and the overall decrease in androgen receptor densities after prenatal treatment as found previously. Hormones are known to have long-lasting organizing effects on behaviour and to affect sexual differentiation in vertebrates. Although research into hormone-mediated maternal effects has been productive, only a few studies describe (the ambiguous) effects into adulthood. Therefore we followed our animals into adulthood and recorded androgen-dependent social behaviour and secondary sexual characteristics, body mass and circulating plasma testosterone levels and checked whether these variables were treatment dependent. Treatment had a near significant effect on comb colour (both brightness and chroma). Again treatment caused a shift towards a more female-like phenotype. This suggests that, in contrast to earlier suggestions, maternal androgens may interact with (but not disrupt) sexual differentiation of brain and behaviour and the development of secondary sexual characteristics.

"The 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-modified titanosilicate was prepared as an alternative for developing efficient adsorbents of heavy metals. The obtained material was characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis, infrared spectroscopy, textural analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. Adsorption of thorium from aqueous solutions was investigated by adsorption isotherms, kinetic and thermodynamic studies. The isothermal data were found to be correlated with the Langmuir model. The maximum sorption capacity of Th(IV) was 83.4mg g(-1). The experimental data show that the external diffusion and intra-particular diffusion are significant in the sorption of thorium. The thermodynamic parameters indicated that the sorption process was physisorption, endothermic and spontaneous.",88
"Introduction: The liver plays a central role in thyroid hormone metabolism, transport, and clearance. A normal function of both the thyroid gland and the liver is therefore necessary to maintain normal thyroid hormone levels and action. Data regarding thyroid function in patients with liver cirrhosis are scarce and variable. The most consistent finding is a decreased free triiodothyronine (fT3) level, which correlates with the severity of liver disease and has been proposed as a prognostic factor for liver-related complications. Aim of the study: To evaluate thyroid hormone values in patients with stable liver cirrhosis and to compare them with healthy controls without liver disease. We also assessed the prevalence of thyroid autoimmunity and whether liver function tests correlated with thyroid function. Material and methods: We performed a prospective case-control study in an endocrinological setting. Twenty-nine patients with stable cirrhosis (20 males and 9 females, mean age 60.97 +/- 7.17 years) were included in the case group and 50 healthy subjects (22 males and 28 females, mean age 61.70 +/- 13.00 years) in the control group. We excluded patients with confounding factors known to influence thyroid function. Levels of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), fT3, free thyroxine (fT4) and anti-TPO-antibodies (TPO-Ab) were measured. These thyroid hormone values were compared in both groups. Biochemical indices of liver function (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], alkaline phosphatase [AP], gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase [GGT], INR, total bilirubin, and albumin levels) were correlated with thyroid function tests. Results: fT3 en fT4 levels were significantly lower in patients with cirrhosis than in healthy subjects (p = 0.001 and 0.002, respectively). TSH levels were not statistically significantly different in the two groups. The level of TPO-Ab was not increased in patients with cirrhosis compared to healthy controls. fT3 correlated negatively with the Child-Pugh score. Discussion: These results indicate that, compared to healthy controls, patients with cirrhosis have decreased fT3 and fT4 levels and comparable TSH levels and may be consistent with findings of limited acquired central hypothyroidism as observed in the non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS). fT3 levels correlated negatively with Child-Pugh score, a measure of severity of liver dysfunction. We did not find an increased prevalence of thyroid autoimmunity in these patients.",133
"The corrosion and odor caused by hydrogen sulfide formation are serious problems in sewer operations, and the cost to prevent these problems is high. Understanding the sulfur cycle mechanism and controlling the sulfur cycle in sediment biofilm are essential to solve these problems. In this review, the reaction mechanisms of the sulfur cycle in sediment biofilm in sewer systems revealed by using in situ microelectrode measurements and molecular biological technologies are summarized. The results indicated that the profile of the reaction process of the sulfur cycle in sediment biofilm was primarily affected by the substrate concentration change in the liquid phase and the various substrate penetrations in sediment biofilm. The biological community's distribution and shifting of sulfate reduction bacteria and sulfide oxidation bacteria across the sediment biofilm were in response to the substrate change of the microenvironment in sediment biofilm. The influence of flow fluctuation on the profile of the sulfur cycle in the sediment biofilm of field sewers, the advantageous biological techniques of pyrosequencing and metagenome analyses combined with novel in situ microelectrode measurements, and the new concept model-related control technology of the sulfur cycle in sediment biofilm should be promoted in future studies.",30
"This paper presents a systematic development of steady-state, small-signal models of interleaved dual boost converter operating in a continuous current mode. These models are derived by employing the well-known signal flow graph method. This signal flow graph approach provides a means to directly translate the switching converter into its equivalent graphic model, from which a complete behaviour of the converter can easily be studied. Steady-state performance, small-signal characteristic transfer functions are derived using Mason's gain formula. The bode plots of audiosusceptibility, input impedance, output impedance, and control-to-output transfer functions are determined and illustrated using MATLAB for different values of load resistances, duty ratios. Small-signal frequency responses obtained from the signal flow graph method are validated with PSPICE simulator results. To validate the signal flow graph modelling equations, sample steady-state experimental results are provided. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",56
"Prion diseases are neurodegenerative pathologies characterized by the accumulation of a protease-resistant form of the cellular prion protein named prion protein scrapie (PrPSc) in the brain. PrPSc accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) result in a dysregulated calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis and subsequent initiation of unfolded protein response (UPR) leading to neuronal dysfunction and apoptosis. The molecular mechanisms for the transition between adaptation to ER stress and ER stress-induced apoptosis are still unclear. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are serine/threonine protein kinases that rule the signaling of many extracellular stimuli from plasma membrane to the nucleus. However the identification of numerous points of cross talk between the UPR and MAPK signaling pathways may contribute to our understanding of the consequences of ER stress in prion diseases. Indeed the MAPK signaling network is known to regulate cell cycle progression and cell survival or death responses following a variety of stresses including misfolded protein response stress. In this article, we review the UPR signaling in prion diseases and discuss the triad of MAPK signaling pathways. We also describe the role played by MAPK signaling cascades in Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). We will also overview the mechanisms of cell death and the role of MAPK signaling in prion disease progression and highlight potential avenues for therapeutic intervention.",19
Angiomyofibroblastoma is a rare and benign tumor that usually involves vulvovaginal area in women of reproductive age and early menopause. We report a lipomatous angiomyofibroblastoma in a 55-year-old multigravid woman. This tumor measured 9 cm in size and contained prominent mature adipose tissue that comprised approximately 50% of the tumor.,9
"Catastrophic circumstances and equipment failures in electrical networks are mostly caused by emerging unidentified phenomena. Resonance and Ferroresonance are those phenomena, which have been investigated since, many years ago. Manitoba Hydro 230 kV electrical network has experienced Ferroresonant states several times. Such conditions may occur in effect of short circuit, breaker phase failure, transformer energizing, load rejection, accidental or scheduled line disconnection, and plant outage. One of the significant consequences of resonant and Ferroresonant states can be an apparent mis-operation or tripping some protective devices and inaccurate operation of instrument transformers. In this paper by means of PSCAD/EMTDC simulation software, Ferroresonant states are analyzed in Manitoba Hydro 230 kV network. Ferroresonant states are classified in to adequate modes by Ferro-resonance detection tools, furthermore; kinds of protective relays subjected to Ferroresonance are simulated in the power network, and operation of relays is assessed.",50
"Introduction: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus associated with a number of clinical manifestations. Primary EBV infection in young adolescents often manifests as acute infectious mononucleosis and latent infection is associated with multiple lymphoid and epithelial cancers and autoimmune disorders, particularly multiple sclerosis.Areas covered: Over the last decade, our understanding of pathogenesis and immune regulation of EBV-associated diseases has provided an important platform for the development of novel vaccine formulations. In this review, we discuss developmental strategies for prophylactic and therapeutic EBV vaccines which have been assessed in preclinical and clinical settings.Expert commentary: Major roadblocks in EBV vaccine development include no precise understanding of the clinical correlates of protection, uncertainty about adjuvant selection and the unavailability of appropriate animal models. Recent development of new EBV vaccine formulations provides exciting opportunities for the formal clinical assessment of novel formulations.",11
"Design of an effective and efficient fractional order PID (FOND) controller, as a generalization of a standard PID controller based on fractional order calculus, for an industrial control system to obtain high-quality performances is of great theoretical and practical significance. From the perspective of multi-objective optimization, this paper presents a novel FOPID controller design method based on an improved multi-objective extremal optimization (MOEO) algorithm for an automatic regulator voltage (AVR) system. The problem of designing FOND controller for AVR is firstly formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem with three objective functions including minimization of integral of absolute error (IAE), absolute steady-state error, and settling time. Then, an improved MOEO algorithm is proposed to solve this problem by adopting individual-based iterated optimization mechanism and polynomial mutation (PLM). From the perspective of algorithm design, the proposed MOEO algorithm is relatively simpler than NSGA-II and single-objective evolutionary algorithms, such as genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), chaotic anti swarm (CAS) due to its fewer adjustable parameters. Furthermore, the superiority of proposed MOEO-FOPID condoner to NSGA-II-based FOPID, single-objective evolutionary algorithms-based FOPID controllers, MOEO-based and NSGA-II-based PID controllers is demonstrated by extensive experimental results on an AVR system in terms of accuracy and robustness.

"Students with autism are more likely to be bullied than their typically developing peers. However, several studies have shown that their likelihood of being bullied increases in the context of exposure to certain risk factors (e.g. behaviour difficulties and poor peer relationships). This study explores vulnerability to bullying from a cumulative risk perspective, where the number of risks rather than their nature is considered. A total of 722 teachers and 119 parents of young people with autism spectrum conditions participated in the study. Established risk factors were summed to form a cumulative risk score in teacher and parent models. There was evidence of a cumulative risk effect in both models, suggesting that as the number of risks increased, so did exposure to bullying. A quadratic effect was found in the teacher model, indicating that there was a disproportionate increase in the likelihood of being bullied in relation to the number of risk factors to which a young person was exposed. In light of these findings, it is proposed that more attention needs to be given to the number of risks to which children and young people with autism spectrum conditions are exposed when planning interventions and providing a suitable educational environment.",113
"Cellulose has been reported as a renewable smart material useful for sensors and actuators. We report an enhanced electromechanical behavior of zinc oxide nanocoated cellulose film (ZONCE). A zinc oxide nanolayer is uniformly formed on the surface of a regenerated cellulose film by using a solution based hydrothermal process. Such a simple ZnO nanolayer deposition of ZONCE shows a drastic improvement of its electromechanical behavior. Physical, chemical, electrical, mechanical and electromechanical characteristics along with the reasons of improved electromechanical behavior of ZONCE are discussed in this paper. Using the ZONCE, a vibration energy harvester is demonstrated. It is promising that the ZONCE is easy to fabricate by an inexpensive solution process without sacrificing biocompatibility, transparency, flexibility and low cost. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

"A comparative life cycle assessment of methanol, hydrogen and electric vehicles is conducted to investigate the impacts of alternative vehicles on the environment and human health. For each case, the processes are analyzed from extraction of raw materials for hydrogen, methanol and electricity to disposal of the vehicles. Three different environmental impact categories are selected in order to understand the diverse effects of vehicles, namely: global warming, human toxicity and ozone layer depletion. As an alternative fuel for internal combustion engines, hydrogen and methanol, are directly utilized in internal combustion engine vehicles. The results of this study show that electric vehicles yield higher human toxicity values due to the respective manufacturing and maintenance stages. Since the energy density of hydrogen is quite higher than methanol, hydrogen driven vehicles result in a more environmentally-benign option with respect to global warming and ozone layer depletion potentials.

"This paper includes comparative analysis of the environmental, energetic, and financial costs of different bus propulsion, possibly applied on the public transport in the city of Belgrade. It considers the modern diesel bus, the trolleybus, the natural gas bus with the spark ignition engine, the electric bus using LiFePO4 battery, and the electric bus with ultra-capacitor. The results are presented according to the real data and the real electro-energetic situation in Serbia, with the dominantly used lignite coal as primary fuel. This model gives the exact exhaust emission of electric vehicles at the thermal power plant, enables its comparison to the internal combustion engine vehicles. The result in analysis shows that the natural gas bus is the most cost efficient in economical way with overall exploitation price of $87 per 100 km. The trolleybus is more economical then the natural gas powered bus only at high departures rate, higher than 230 per workday.",87
"Background: Evaluation of medication efficacy and safety is an essential guarantee to successful therapeutic outcome in public health practices. However, larger distribution chain supply in developing countries such as Cameroon is often challenged by counterfeit drugs, poor manufacturing, storage and degradation leading to health and patient adverse consequences. Yet, access to supply chain management in strengthening ARVs quality assurance and outcomes remains poorly documented. More than 53,000 patients have been enrolled on free ARVs medications, but little is documented on quality assurance and validity of safety for affected populations along the supply chain management since 2008. Methods: The cross sectional study was conducted in ARVs distribution units and centers in central, littoral and south west regions of Cameroon. ARVs drugs samples included Nevirapine, Efavirenz, and fixed dose combinations of Zidovudine + Lamivudine, Lamivudine + Stavudine and Zidovudine + Lamivudine + Nevirapine. Drugs packaging and labeling was assessed and galenic assays were performed at National Laboratory of quality Control of Medications and Expertise (LANACOME), Yaounde, Cameroon. Results: The study covered 16 structures located in eight different towns including the central ARVs store, two regional pharmaceutical procurement centers and thirteen HIV approved treatment centers and management units. A total of 35 ARVs products were collected. Only eight ARVs drugs containing Lamivudine and Stavudine presented with white stains on tablets, however these drugs were standard for all other tests performed. The others 28 ARVs products were standards to all assays performed. Conclusion: We concluded that ARVs drugs freely accessible and distributed to PLWHA are of good quality in Cameroon. However, with the increase number of patients under HAART since 2013, adoption of ""Test and Treat"" approach to reach the 90-90-90 goals and with the implementation of new national antiretroviral regimen guidelines and molecules such as boosted protease inhibitors, continuous quality control and assurance surveillance, monitoring and evaluation is recommended. Assessment of quality of formulations that are more susceptible to degradation such as pediatric formulations for averting the rising multidrug resistance trend is also desired.",132
"In the present work, we provide a most extensive and detailed study of highly ionized Cu-like ions and diagnose extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray (SXR) transitions with N-shell electron excitation to M-shell and higher shells. We have determined energy levels and lifetimes for lowest 27 fine-structure levels by adopting multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock (MCDF) with the inclusion of quantum electrodynamics (QED) as well as Breit corrections as a first-order perturbation theory. We have also reported complete radiative data for strong electric dipole transitions within lowest 27 levels. We have compared our calculated results with theoretically calculated and experimentally measured results available in the literature, to measure the credibility and genuineness of our results, and achieve good agreement. Further, because of insufficiency of adequate and complete atomic data for higher levels of highly ionized Cu-like ions in the literature, we have performed other equivalent parallel calculations by implementing fully relativistic distorted wave flexible atomic code (FAC) to ensure the accuracy of our results. Additionally, we have also presented transition wavelengths of N alpha transitions of high-Z Cu-like ions by using Moseley's law. We believe that the large amount of atomic data presented in this paper may be useful in fusion and astrophysical plasma and in several applications, especially in lithography and cell biology.",31
"Surface soil moisture (SSM) is an important parameter at the land-atmosphere interface. In past decades, passive microwave remote sensing offers a good opportunity for obtaining SSM on a global scale, and many downscaling methods have been proposed using the triangle-based empirical soil moisture relationship models to overcome the limitation of coarse spatial resolution of its SSM products for regional applications. This paper aimed to examine and compare the effectiveness of five typical triangle-based empirical soil moisture relationship models for estimating SSM with Landsat-5 data and in situ measurements from the Maqu network on the northeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau for nine cloud-free days. The results showed that the model that treats the SSM as a second-order polynomial with land surface temperature, vegetation indices (VIs), and surface albedo as inputs exhibited the best performance compared with the results of other models. The VI comparison indicated that the use of the normalized difference VI or the fractional vegetation cover in this model outperformed other VIs, with the root-mean-square deviation of approximately 0.055 m(3)/m(3) and the coefficient of determination (R-2) above 0.78 at the nine-day average level. In addition, a significant spatial scale effect of the model was also found through analyzing the model fitting results at different window sizes. The study provides important insight into the best empirical relationship models for capturing soil moisture dynamics. These models can support the passive microwave soil moisture data spatial downscaling and validation applications in future studies.",94
"Objective(s): To gauge fertility specialists' knowledge, clinical practices, and training needs in regard to eating disorders. Design: Cross-sectional study. Settings: Fertility clinics. Participants: Eighty Australian and New Zealand fertility specialists who were members of the Fertility Society of Australia. Intervention(s): None. Main Outcome Measures(s): Responses to an anonymously completed online questionnaire. Result(s): Approximately 54% of doctors correctly identified the body mass index relevant to anorexia nervosa, and 30% identified menstrual disturbances for anorexia, while 63.8% of doctors incorrectly nominated maladaptive weight control behaviors as a characteristic of binge eating disorder. While clinicians (83.7%) agreed it was important to screen for eating disorders during preconception assessments, 35% routinely screened for eating disorders and 8.8% indicated that their clinics had clinical practice guidelines for management of eating disorders. A minority of participants (13.8%) felt satisfied with their level of university training in eating disorders, 37.5% of doctors felt confident in their ability to recognize symptoms of an eating disorder, and 96.2% indicated a need for further education and clinical guidelines. On most items examined, knowledge and clinical practices regarding eating disorders did not differ according to doctor gender or years of clinical experience working as a fertility specialist. Conclusion(s): Knowledge about eating disorders in the context of fertility treatment is important. This study highlights the uncertainty among fertility specialists in detecting features of eating disorders. The findings point to the importance of further education and training, including the development of clinical guidelines specific to fertility health care providers.

"The function of AZI1 in systemic acquired resistance of Arabidopsis was confirmed by investigation of the phenotypic features of wild-type Col-0, AZI1 T-DNA knockout and AZI1 overexpressing plants after infection with virulent and avirulent Pseudomonas syringae. Real-time quantitative PCR and Northern blotting analyses showed that the transcript abundances of PR genes increased significantly in local and systemic leaves of wild-type Col-0 and AZI1 overexpressing plants challenged with avirulent P. syringae, whereas the mRNA accumulation of PR genes was obviously attenuated in local and systemic leaves of AZI1 T-DNA knockout plants after localized infiltration with avirulent Psm avrRpm1. The changes of metabolomic profiles in distal leaves of three types of materials infected with avirulent P. syringae were determined by H-1 NMR spectrometry and data mining showed that the soluble carbonhydrates might function as signal substances in the systemic immunity of Arabidopsis. At the same time, the expression of the sugar signaling genes in local and distal leaves after infection of avirulent P. syringae was compared. As a result, it was found that the transcript abundances of sugar signaling genes, including SUS1, SUS2, SUS3, SUS6, SUT1, HXK1, HXK2, SNRK1.2, ERD6, TPS1, TOR, SNRK1.1, SNRK1.3 and bZIP11, were obviously changed in distal leaves of different materials with the modulated AZI1 activities, indicating sugar-related genes are involved in regulation of the systemic immunity mediated by AZI1. These results also illustrated that the immune system associated with sugar molecules probably was an important part of the systemic acquired resistance in Arabidopsis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

"The interpretation of regression models results can often benefit from the generation of nomograms, user friendly' graphical devices especially useful for assisting the decision-making processes. However, in the case of multinomial regression models, whenever categorical responses with more than two classes are involved, nomograms cannot be drawn in the conventional way. Such a difficulty in managing and interpreting the outcome could often result in a limitation of the use of multinomial regression in decision-making support. In the present paper, we illustrate the derivation of a non-conventional nomogram for multinomial regression models, intended to overcome this issue. Although it may appear less straightforward at first sight, the proposed methodology allows an easy interpretation of the results of multinomial regression models and makes them more accessible for clinicians and general practitioners too. Development of prediction model based on multinomial logistic regression and of the pertinent graphical tool is illustrated by means of an example involving the prediction of the extent of liver fibrosis in hepatitis C patients by routinely available markers.",130
"Though many of people's impressions about each other stem from qualities that are obvious or apparent, social perceptions also rely on a variety of subtle cues that guide judgment and behavior. For example, emerging work has increasingly elucidated the conditions and means by which individuals' accuracy in judging others' sexual orientation is better than chance. We discuss these here, focusing on four domains from which people draw cues to accurately perceive sexual orientation: how people adorn themselves (adornment), how they move (actions), how they sound (acoustics), and how they look (appearance). Moreover, we describe how certain factors, such as one's own sexual orientation, can constrain or facilitate this accuracy and describe the various negative social and occupational consequences that may result from cues that someone is gay or straight.",61
"Objective: In 2001, we provided benchmark estimates of probability of pregnancy given a single act of intercourse. Those calculations assumed that intercourse and ovulation are independent. Subsequent research has shown that this assumption is not valid. We provide here an update of previous benchmark estimates. Study design: We reanalyze earlier data from two North Carolina studies that collected daily urine samples and recorded daily intercourse for multiple menstrual cycles. One study comprised 68 sexually active women with either an intrauterine device or tubal ligation. The second was of 221 women who planned to become pregnant and had discontinued use of any birth control at enrollment. Participants had no known fertility problems. New statistical analyses were based on Monte Carlo simulations and Bayesian methods. Results: The probability that a single act of intercourse occurs within a woman's fertile window is 25%, compared with 20% in previous calculations. The probability of pregnancy with intercourse on a given menstrual cycle day is correspondingly higher than previously estimated, with the largest increases occurring on menstrual days 12-22. These increases are, however, fairly small (for example, the peak chance of conception on menstrual day 13 increased from 8.6% to 9.7%). Conclusions: Previous benchmark rates of pregnancy with one act of intercourse were moderately underestimated due to a mistaken assumption about the independence of intercourse and ovulation. Implications statement: The chance of pregnancy with a single act of unprotected intercourse is greater than previously estimated. Previous benchmarks may underestimate the efficacy of post-coital contraception. Published by Elsevier Inc.",116
"The aim of this study was to examine differences in the neural processing of social information about kin and friends at different levels of closeness and social network level. Twenty-five female participants engaged in a cognitive social task involving different individuals in their social network while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning to detect BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent) signals changes. Greater levels of activation occurred in several regions of the brain previously associated with social cognition when thinking about friends than when thinking about kin, including the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC). Linear parametric analyses across network layers further showed that, when it came to thinking about friends, activation increased in the vMPFC, lingual gyrus, and sensorimotor cortex as individuals thought about friends at closer layers of the network. These findings suggest that maintaining friendships may be more cognitively exacting than maintaining kin relationships.",62
"The search for natural principles is attracting much interest in the field of skin care. Fabaceae are major agricultural crops and potential sources of bioactive compounds with possible applications in human health and skin care. This study concerns the biological activities of the legume crops Melilotus officinalis (L.) Pall. and Lespedeza capitata Michx. for their potential use in skin care applications. The effects of plant ethanolic extracts at doses ranging from 0.25 to 50 mu g/mL (from 1 to 5000 mu g/mL in cell viability assays) were evaluated using in vitro tests on HaCaT human keratinocytes, 46BR1N fibroblasts, and adipocyte cell cultures, and on matrix-degrading enzymes. MTT assay revealed weak effects on cell viability (IC50 >1000 mu g/mL) and significant increase of fibroblast growth rate with both extracts. Similar induction of cell motility by the two extracts was observed on keratinocytes, while on fibroblasts M. officinalis induced a stronger effect with respect to L. capitata. Cell-free enzymatic assays showed stronger collagenase inhibition by L. capitata, while an ELISA assay revealed more efficient stimulation of fibroblast collagen production by M. officinalis. Oil-Red-0 adipocyte staining showed more pronounced lipolytic effect of M. officinalis with respect to L. capitata. Both extracts showed the ability of stimulating skin cells in order to promote tissue regeneration, prevent skin aging, and reduce fat deposition. In most cases, different patterns of activation/inhibition were observed. Data indicate that these legume crops could be profitably exploited in skin care applications, possibly in combined formulations for the development of antiaging and anticellulite products.

"Recently, Vernier permanent magnet (VPM) machines, one special case of magnetic flux-modulated (MFM) machines, benefiting from their compact, simple construction and low-speed/high-torque characteristics, have been receiving increasing interest. In this paper, the Vernier structure is integrated with an axial-flux PM machine to obtain the magnetic gear effect and produce an improved torque density for direct-drive wind power generation application. Another advantage of the proposed machine is that the stator flux rotating speed can be relatively high when the shaft speed is low. With this benefit, sensorless control strategy can be easily implemented in a wide speed range. In this paper, an improved sliding mode observer (SMO) is proposed to estimate the rotor position and the speed of the proposed machine. With the estimated shaft speeds, the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control strategy is applied to maximize the wind power extraction. The machine design and the sensorless MPPT control strategy are verified by finite element analysis and experimental verification.",85
"Development of transgenic edible plants, to be used as production, storage and delivery systems for recombinant vaccine antigens, is a promising strategy to obtain cost effective vaccines against infectious diseases, not least for use in developing countries. Therefore, we used Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated gene transfer to introduce the p24 gag gene encoding the nucleocapsid protein from HIV-1 subtype C into the Arabidopsis thaliana plant genome. Eighteen plant lines were confirmed positive for the p24 gene by PCR; four of these lines showed an apparent homozygous phenotype when grown on selective medium and these lines also showed transcription of the p24 gene into its corresponding mRNA. The mRNA in all four cases generated the p24 protein in plants, as verified by Western blot analysis. The plants were shown to contain between 0.2 mu g and 0.5 mu g p24 protein per g of fresh tissue. Analysis of the localisation of the p24 protein showed that stem tissue contained the largest amount of protein, more than twice as much as leaf tissue, whereas no p24 protein was detected in roots. By using Southern blotting, we found that 4, 2-3, 2 and 1 T-DNA insertion events took place in the four lines 1, 2, 7, and 10, respectively. The genetic insertions of line 1 were stable from the T(2) to the T(5) generation and gave rise to the p24 protein in all cases, as verified by Western blotting. In mice fed with fresh transgenic A. thaliana (line 10), anti-gag IgG was obtained in serum after a booster injection with recombinant p37Gag. No immune response was observed after equal booster injection of untreated mice or mice fed with A. thaliana WT plants.",39
"Background: The Ottawa Ankle Rules provide guidelines for clinicians on the recommendation of radiographic tests to verify fractures in patients with ankle injuries. The use of the Ottawa Ankle Rules by emergency nurses has been suggested to minimise unnecessary radiographic-test requests and reduce patients' length of stay in emergency departments. However, the findings of studies in this area are inconsistent. Design: A systematic review was conducted to synthesise the most accurate evidence available on the extent to which emergency nurses' use of the Ottawa Ankle Rules to initiate radiographic tests improves healthcare outcomes for patients with ankle injuries. Data sources: The systematic review attempted to identify all relevant published and unpublished studies in English and Chinese from databases such as Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, ProQuest Health and Medical Complete, EBM Reviews, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL Plus, the British Nursing Index, Scopus, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, China Journal Net, WanFang Data, the National Central Library Periodical Literature System, HyRead, the Digital Dissertation Consortium, MedNar and Google Scholar. Review methods: Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of all of the studies identified during the search, based on their titles and abstracts. If a study met the criteria for inclusion, or inconclusive information was available in its title and abstract, the full text was retrieved for further analysis. The methodological quality of all of the eligible studies was assessed independently by the two reviewers. Results: The search of databases and other sources yielded 1603 records. The eligibility of 17 full-text articles was assessed, and nine studies met the inclusion criteria. All nine studies were subjected to narrative analysis, and five were meta-analysed. All of the studies investigated the use of the refined Ottawa Ankle Rules. The results indicated that emergency nurses' use of the refined Ottawa Ankle Rules minimised unnecessary radiographic-test requests and reduced patients' length of stay in emergency departments. However, the use of these rules in urgent-care departments did not reduce unnecessary radiographic-test requests or patients' length of stay. The implementation of the refined Ottawa Ankle Rules by emergency nurses with different backgrounds, including nurse practitioners or general emergency nurses was found to reduce patients' length of stay in emergency departments. Conclusions: The results of the systematic review suggested that a nurse-initiated radiographic test protocol should be introduced as standard practice in emergency departments.

"Purpose Human breath analysis is proposed with increasing frequency as a useful tool in clinical application. We performed this study to find the characteristic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the exhaled breath of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) for discrimination from healthy subjects. Methods VOCs in the exhaled breath of 40 IPF patients and 55 healthy controls were measured using a multi-capillary column and ion mobility spectrometer. The patients were examined by pulmonary function tests, blood gas analysis, and serum biomarkers of interstitial pneumonia. Results We detected 85 VOC peaks in the exhaled breath of IPF patients and controls. IPF patients showed 5 significant VOC peaks; p-cymene, acetoin, isoprene, ethylbenzene, and an unknown compound. The VOC peak of p-cymene was significantly lower (p < 0.001), while the VOC peaks of acetoin, isoprene, ethylbenzene, and the unknown compound were significantly higher (p < 0.001 for all) compared with the peaks of controls. Comparing VOC peaks with clinical parameters, negative correlations with VC (r =-0.393, p = 0.013), %VC (r =-0.569, p < 0.001), FVC (r = -0.440, p = 0.004), %FVC (r =-0.539, p < 0.001), DLco (r =-0.394, p = 0.018), and %DLco (r =-0.413, p = 0.008) and a positive correlation with KL-6 (r = 0.432, p = 0.005) were found for p-cymene. Conclusion We found characteristic 5 VOCs in the exhaled breath of IPF patients. Among them, the VOC peaks of p-cymene were related to the clinical parameters of IPF. These VOCs may be useful biomarkers of IPF.",3
"The safety study of transgenic plants has an actual significance for creating new species and commercializing transgenic plants. Based on PCR and Southern blotting tests of transgene, the genetic stability of ipt gene in an advanced generation of transgenic rice plants was studied. Use a plate colony counting technique, the influence of ipt rice plants on bacteria number of rhizospheric soil was investigated. Molecular detection showed foreign ipt gene was stable genetic in the genome of T-8 transgenic rice with a single copy. The amounts of bacteria from the root soil of transgenic lines were distinct from non-transgenic controls during the tillering stage, heading stage and filling stage. Nevertheless, this variability was not significant during the growing season described above (P>0.05). These results reveal that T-8-ipt rice cannot affect the soil bacteria biomass during plants field-growth.",39
"Combination of reverse transcription (RT) and deep sequencing has emerged as a powerful instrument for the detection of RNA modifications, a field that has seen a recent surge in activity because of its importance in gene regulation. Recent studies yielded high-resolution RT signatures of modified ribonucleotides relying on both sequence-dependent mismatch patterns and reverse transcription arrests. Common alignment viewers lack specialized functionality, such as filtering, tailored visualization, image export and differential analysis. Consequently, the community will profit from a platform seamlessly connecting detailed visual inspection of RT signatures and automated screening for modification candidates. CoverageAnalyzer (CAn) was developed in response to the demand for a powerful inspection tool. It is freely available for all three main operating systems. With SAM file format as standard input, CAn is an intuitive and user-friendly tool that is generally applicable to the large community of biomedical users, starting from simple visualization of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data, up to sophisticated modification analysis with significance-based modification candidate calling.",68

"Targeting non-native-ligand binding sites for potential investigative and therapeutic applications is an attractive strategy in proteins that share common native ligands, as in Rab1 protein. Rab1 is a subfamily member of Rab proteins, which are members of Ras GTPase superfamily. All Ras GTPase superfamily members bind to native ligands GTP and GDP, that switch on and off the proteins, respectively. Rab1 is physiologically essential for autophagy and transport between endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Pathologically, Rab1 is implicated in human cancers, a neurodegenerative disease, cardiomyopathy, and bacteria-caused infectious diseases. We have performed structural analyses on Rab1 protein using a unique ensemble of clustering methods, including multi-step principal component analysis, non-negative matrix factorization, and independent component analysis, to better identify representative Rab1 proteins than the application of a single clustering method alone does. We then used the identified representative Rab1 structures, resolved in multiple ligand states, to map their known and novel binding sites. We report here at least a novel binding site on Rab1, involving Rab1-specific residues that could be further explored for the rational design and development of investigative probes and/or therapeutic small molecules against the Rab1 protein.

"Mapping between ontologies and relational databases is a necessity in realising the Semantic-Web vision. Most of the work concerning this topic has either (1) extracted OWL schemas using a limited range of OWL modelling constructs from relational schemas, or (2) extracted relational schemas from OWL schemas, that represent the OWL schemas as much as possible. By contrast, we propose a general framework that maps between relational databases and schemas expressed in OWL 2. In particular, we regard the transformation from databases to ontologies as being a two-phase process. Firstly, to convert the relational schemas into OWL schemas, and then to enrich the OWL schemas with highly expressive axioms, based on analysing the schemas and the data in the databases. Testing our data analysis heuristics on a number of databases, show that they produce OWL schemas, that include more semantic information than found in their respective relational schemas.",112
"Background: Co-speech gestures are part of nonverbal communication during conversations. They either support the verbal message or provide the interlocutor with additional information. Furthermore, they prompt as nonverbal cues the cooperative process of turn taking. In the present study, we investigated the influence of co-speech gestures on the perception of dyadic dialogue in aphasic patients. In particular, we analysed the impact of co-speech gestures on gaze direction (towards speaker or listener) and fixation of body parts. We hypothesized that aphasic patients, who are restricted in verbal comprehension, adapt their visual exploration strategies. Methods: Sixteen aphasic patients and 23 healthy control subjects participated in the study. Visual exploration behaviour was measured by means of a contact-free infrared eye-tracker while subjects were watching videos depicting spontaneous dialogues between two individuals. Cumulative fixation duration and mean fixation duration were calculated for the factors co-speech gesture (present and absent), gaze direction (to the speaker or to the listener), and region of interest (ROI), including hands, face, and body. Results: Both aphasic patients and healthy controls mainly fixated the speaker's face. We found a significant co-speech gesture x ROI interaction, indicating that the presence of a co-speech gesture encouraged subjects to look at the speaker. Further, there was a significant gaze direction x ROI x group interaction revealing that aphasic patients showed reduced cumulative fixation duration on the speaker's face compared to healthy controls. Conclusion: Co-speech gestures guide the observer's attention towards the speaker, the source of semantic input. It is discussed whether an underlying semantic processing deficit or a deficit to integrate audio-visual information may cause aphasic patients to explore less the speaker's face.

"Context: The Lystedt law requires high school athletes who have sustained a concussion to be removed from practice and play and not to be allowed to return until cleared by a medical professional. Objective: To determine the effect of the Lystedt law on injury and concussion documentation in the Seattle public high schools. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Seattle public high schools. Patients or Other Participants: The numbers of students, aged 13 to 19 years in the 2008-2009, 2009-2010, and 2010-2011 school years, were 4348, 4925, and 4806, respectively. Main Outcome Measure(s): All injuries documented in SportsWare by athletic trainers in Seattle public high schools. We evaluated all injuries, including concussions recorded during the 2008-2009 school year, before the Lystedt law, and during the 2 school years after the law took effect (2009-2010 and 2010-2011). Incidence rates before and after the law were estimated and compared. Results: The concussion rate was -1.09% in 2008-2009, 2.26% in 2009-2010, and 2.26% in 2010-2011. A comparison of relative risks showed that the incidence rates of concussions were different before and 1 year after the Lystedt law (relative risk = 2.10; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.50, 2.93) and 2 years after the law (relative risk = 2.10; 95% CI = 1.49, 2.93). Overall, the mean number of days out of play after 2008-2009 was almost 7 days greater after the law took effect (difference = 6.9 days; 95% CI = 0.70, 13.1). For females, the mean number of days out of play after 2008-2009 was more than 17 days in 2009-2010 (difference = 17.2 days; 95% CI = 4.81, 29.5) and was more than 6 days in 2010-2011 (difference = 6.3 days; 95% CI = 1.62, 11.0). Conclusions: The number of documented concussions more than doubled after the institution of the Lystedt law, which may be attributed to heightened awareness and closer monitoring.",27
"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a diagnosis defined by impairments in several dynamic processes (e.g., interpersonal relating, affect regulation, behavioral control). Theories of BPD emphasize that these impairments appear in specific contexts, and emerging results confirm this view. At the same time, BPD is a complex construct that encompasses individuals with heterogeneous pathology. These featuresdynamic processes, situational specificity, and individual heterogeneitypose significant assessment challenges. In the current study, we demonstrate assessment and analytic methods that capture both between-person differences and within-person changes over time. Twenty-five participants diagnosed with BPD completed event-contingent, ambulatory assessment protocols over 21 days. We used p-technique factor analyses to identify person-specific psychological structures consistent with clinical theories of personality. Five exemplar cases are selected and presented in detail to showcase the potential utility of these methods. The presented cases' factor structures reflect not only heterogeneity but also suggest points of convergence. The factors also demonstrated significant associations with important clinical targets (self-harm, interpersonal violence).",70
"Extensive studies have reported cognitive abnormalities in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Another line of evidence suggests that stress also affects cognitive functions. In this study, we investigated whether there were associations between stress hormones and cognitive functions in ASD and typically developing (TD) children. Cognitive functions in ASD and TD children were evaluated with a battery of psychological tests for working memory, behavioral flexibility, and social cognition for emotional assessments of others. ASD children exhibited higher hair and salivary cortisol, which reflects chronic and acute stress hormone levels of subjects, respectively, than TD children. Autism-spectrum quotient (AQ) was positively correlated with hair cortisol and the scores of Spence Children's Anxiety Scale in ASD children. In addition, a negative correlation was present between spatial working memory performance and hair cortisol in ASD, but not in TD, children. These results suggest that chronic stress hormone elevation may have relationships with some aspects of cognitive dysfunction in ASD subjects. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

"Allergic rhinitis is a common chronic disorder characterized by immunoglobulin E-mediated inflammation. To identify new genes associated with this trait, we performed genome-and epigenome-wide association studies and linked marginally significant CpGs located in genes or its promoter and SNPs located 1 Mb from the CpGs, by identifying cis methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL). This approach relies on functional cellular aspects rather than stringent statistical correction. We were able to identify one gene with significant cis-mQTL for allergic rhinitis, caudal-type homeobox 1 (CDX1). We also identified 11 genes with marginally significant cis-mQTLs (p < 0.05) including one with both allergic rhinitis with or without asthma (RNF39). Moreover, most SNPs identified were not located closest to the gene they were linked to through cis-mQTLs counting the one linked to CDX1 located in a gene previously associated with asthma and atopic dermatitis. By combining omics data, we were able to identify new genes associated with allergic rhinitis and better assess the genes linked to associated SNPs.",110
"Human metabolism of the S-warfarin enantiomer is catalyzed primarily by cytochrome P4502C9 (CYP2C9), which, because of the enzyme's broad drug substrate specificity, leads to drug-S-warfarin interactions. Several warfarin analogs have been synthesized and used to determine whether they exhibit diminished interactions with CYP2C9. The kinetics of the warfarin analogs' inhibition of human liver microsomal CYP2C9 catalyzed metabolism of S-warfarin to S-7-hydroxywarfarin have been investigated. R- and S-7-fluorowarfarin were both predominantly competitive inhibitors, whereas racemic 6-fluorowarfarin and racemic 6,7,8-trifluorowarfarin were predominantly mixed inhibitors with some competitive inhibition. For the alcohols produced by reductive methylation of the side chain of R- and S-warfarin, the R-enantiomer did not inhibit S-warfarin metabolism, whereas the S-enantiomer was primarily a competitive inhibitor. The fluorine substituted warfarins and the S-warfarin alcohol apparently bind with high affinity to CYP2C9. Thus their use clinically (if efficacious) would not prevent CYP2C9 associated warfarin-drug interactions. The R-warfarin alcohol did not inhibit CYP2C9 catalyzed metabolism of S-warfarin and is less likely than warfarin to participate in CYP2C9 associated warfarin-drug interactions.

"Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital disorder characterized by intestinal aganglionosis leading to pseudoobstruction. The majority of cases are limited to the rectum or rectosigmoid (S-HSCR). A variably longer segment can be affected (L-HSCR), which may show many deviations from S-HSCR. We retrospectively reviewed 48 clinicopathologically confirmed total cases of HSCR at a single institution in a 21-year period to identify L-HSCR cases and determine their deviations from known features of S-HSCR. Eight L-HSCR cases were found where aganglionosis extended to the terminal ileum (7/8) or to the splenic flexure (1/8). L-HSCR lacked male preponderance and was in contrast more common in females (6/8). Associated anomalies included congenital heart disease (2) and neonatal hypothyroidism (1), previously underreported associations. The clinical diagnosis of L-HSCR was often delayed (average age at diagnosis 13 days) and the diagnosis was more often made operatively (5/8) rather than on rectal suction biopsy (3/8). Histologically, apart from aganglionosis, neural hyperplasia was either absent or focal, compounding the diagnostic difficulty. Although the number of cases in our study was limited due to the rarity of L-HSCR, this study still highlights the spectrum of deviations of L-HSCR from known clinicopathological features of S-HSCR.",129
"In this study, the authors propose a novel method to encrypt a colour image by use of Logistic mapping and double random-phase encoding. Firstly, use Logistic mapping to diffuse the colour image, then the red, green and blue components of the result are scrambled by replacement matrices generated by Logistic mapping. Secondly, by utilising double random-phase encoding to encrypt the three scrambled images into one encrypted image. Experiment results reveal the fact that the proposed method not only can achieve good encryption result, but also that the key space is large enough to resist against common attack.",57
"A 3-D electron-beam-induced current (EBIC) model was implemented in technology computer aided design simulations. The model uses a carefully designed charge carrier generation profile that describes how an electron beam induces charge carriers in a semiconducting device and then drift-diffusion equations are solved to determine the resulting current. The simulation provides a map of the EBIC signal, which can be compared with experimental 2-D profiles. This comparison can be used to fit parameters such as the surface recombination rate which is otherwise difficult to fit in completed devices. Additional experimental data for these fits are obtained by performing the experiments at different electron beam energies and thereby generating carriers at different depths in the sample. The experiments were performed on cross sections of silicon photodiodes with varying surface preparations. A strong influence of the surface preparation method on the charge carrier diffusion was observed.",82
"BACKGROUND The concept of 'Myeloproliferative Neoplasms' (MPNs) was introduced by William Dameshek(1) in 1951 by grouping together Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML), Polycythaemia Rubra Vera (PRV), Essential Thrombocythaemia (ET), Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF) and Erythroleukaemia; a self-perpetuating trilineage myeloproliferation was underlined as the pathogenesis. JAK2 is one of the 4 Janus Kinases, which are non-receptor tyrosine kinases that are integral part of the cytokine and growth factor signalling. Its autoinhibitory function is released by a gain of mutation in the JAK2 V617F mutation. It leads to downstream activation of several signalling cascades like STAT proteins, PI3K-AKT pathway and mitogen activated protein kinases. Recent studies suggest that mutations in the TET2 tumour suppressor gene, which have been found in 17% of JAK2 V617F+ Ph-MPNs and 7% of JAK2V617Ecases, likely precede the acquisition of the JAK2 V617F mutation. Detection of mutation can be by Direct sequencing, Restriction fragment length polymorphism or allele-specific PCR. JAK2 Exon 12 Mutation is specific to JAK2 V617F negative PRV73. JAK2 N542E543 deletion is the most frequent among the ones described. These patients are usually heterozygous for the mutation with Erythroid myelopoiesis, subnormal serum erythropoietin levels and younger age at diagnosis. Apart from BCR-ABL mutation, others include JAK2 V617E, JAK2 EXON12, MPL, KIT, Calreticulin and TET2 mutations. The Objectives of our Study were 1. To study the clinico-morphologic features of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms with reference to the 2008 revised WHO classification of myeloid neoplasms. 2. To study the prevalence of JAK2 V617E in our region. MATERIALS AND METHODS It will be a descriptive study that is set in the Haematology Clinical Pathology Laboratory of MCH, Thiruvananthapuram. The bone marrow samples that are obtained from the Department of Medicine, which show features of MPNs are selected (based on the revised criteria). For these selected cases, the clinical history is collected and is compared with the peripheral smear, bone marrow aspirate, trephine and reticulin stain and the MPN is typed. JAK2 V617E study is advised for the cases of PRV. RESULTS A total of 60 Myeloproliferative Neoplasms were studied with a male predominance (63.2%) and the most frequent age group being 40 -80 years. Most were cases of Polycythaemia Rubra Vera (35%) followed by Essential Thrombocythaemia (30%), Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia and Progressive Myelofibrosis (15%), Chronic Neutrophilic Leukaemia and Chronic Eosinophilic Leukaemia. Most cases were incidentally detected and a statistically significant relationship was noted between presenting complaint and the type of MPN. The cases of MPN were studied for JAK2 mutation status as well, showed 24% positivity with 9.5% cases being lost to followup. Among the JAK2 positive cases, 60% presented with thrombotic episodes and 60% had splenomegaly. CONCLUSION 60 cases of MPN were studied; cases selected in accordance with the 2008 WHO classification of myeloid neoplasms. Polycythaemia Rubra Vera is the commonest. Cases of PRV, ET, CIMF, CNL and CEL are being identified with more frequency compared to the earlier study conducted in our Department in 1994, probably because of increased awareness of these conditions and also better and clearcut diagnostic criteria available.",12
"Objective:The aim of this study Was to evaluate the relationship between alexithymia and aggression among men with substance dependence. In addition, we wanted to control the effect of variables such as depression and anxiety on this relationship. Methods: Participants were 200 consecutively admitted substance-dependent inpatients. Patients were assessed with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20, the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Results: Of the substance-dependent inpatients, 34.0% (n=68) constituted a group suffering from alexithymia. Rates of being unemployed, being married, duration of education, and current age did not differ between the groups, whereas age at onset of regular substance use was lower in the group with alexithymia. The alexithymic group had higher scores of aggression, depression, as well as trait and state anxieties. A hierarchical linear regression analysis demonstrated that the difficulty in identifying feelings (DIF) factor of alexithymia was related with aggression, although chronic anxiety contributed to this relationship particularly in the anger and hostility dimensions of aggression. Conclusion: Trait DIF may be directly related with aggression, whereas state DIF may be a way of coping among those with chronic anxiety and may be indirectly related with cognitive and affective components of aggression. The relevance of these relationships for prevention and treatment of substance dependents deserves interest in further research.",73
"The detection of glucose plays a significant role in diagnostics and management of diabetes and it is thus desired to develop non-noble-metal electrocatalyst for nonenzymatic glucose sensing. This work demonstrates the first use of monolithically integrated copper phosphide nanowire on copper foam (Cu3P NW/CF) as an efficient catalyst for electrochemical oxidation of glucose. As a nonenzymatic glucose sensor, this Cu3P NW/CF exhibits a low detection limit of 0.32 mu M at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 with a linear range from 0.005 to 1 mM (R-2 = 0.997). It also shows high anti-interference property to other normally co-existing electroactive species including lactose, fructose, ascorbic acid, uric acid, urea, dopiamine, and sucorse as well as excellent resistance to chloride poisoning. Its application for glucose detection in human serum sample is also demonstrated successfully. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",120
"Helicobacter pylori is an important human pathogen that causes chronic gastritis and is associated with the development of peptic ulcer disease and gastric malignancies. The oral cavity has been implicated as a potential H. pylori reservoir and may therefore be involved in the reinfection of the stomach, which can sometimes occur following treatment of an H. pylori infection. The objectives of this paper were (i) to determine the presence of H. pylori in the oral cavity and (ii) to examine the relationship between oral H. pylori and subsequent gastritis. Gastric biopsies, saliva samples and dental plaques were obtained from 78 dyspeptic adults. DNA was extracted and evaluated for the presence of H. pylori using polymerase chain reaction and Southern blotting methods. Persons with gastritis were frequently positive for H. pylori in their stomachs (p < 0.0001) and there was a statistically significant correlation between the presence of H. pylori in gastric biopsies and the oral cavity (p < 0.0001). Our results suggest a relationship between gastric infection and the presence of this bacterium in the oral cavity. Despite this, H. pylori were present in the oral cavity with variable distribution between saliva and dental plaques, suggesting the existence of a reservoir for the species and a potential association with gastric reinfection.",39
"The dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D3) is used to investigate the mechanism of mesoporous pulp waste (MPW) and polyaniline (PANI) adsorptive removal methyl orange (MO) dye from their aqueous solutions. The results are absolutely reliable because of the sufficiently accurate method although such big systems are studied. It is demonstrated that hydrogen bond and Van Der Waals interactions play a significant role in MO adsorption by MPW and PANI. For MO adsorption by MPW, hydrogen bond and Van Der Waals interactions are both weakened in S-1 state. In contrast, hydrogen bond and Van Der Waals interactions between PANI and MO are both enhanced in S-1 state. The thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy and free energy change reveal that the MO adsorption by MPW and PANI are spontaneous and exothermic. The adsorption of MO on MPW is less favorable in S-1 state and the adsorption of MO on PANI is more favorable in S-1 state. Therefore, the photoexcitation should be controlled during the MO adsorption by MPW and applied for MO adsorption by PANI.",88
"Pelvic floor disorders (PFD), including urinary incontinence, anal incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse, are common and have a negative effect on the quality of life of women. Treatment is associated with morbidity and may not be totally satisfactory. Prevention of PFDs, when possible, should be a primary goal. The purpose of this paper is to summarise the current literature and give an evidence-based review of the prevention of PFDs A working subcommittee from the International Urogynecological Association (IUGA) Research and Development (R&D) Committee was formed. An initial document addressing the prevention of PFDs was drafted, based on a review of the English-language literature. After evaluation by the entire IUGA R&D Committee, revisions were made. The final document represents the IUGA R&D Committee Opinion on the prevention of PFDs. This R&D Committee Opinion reviews the literature on the prevention of PFDs and summarises the findings with evidence-based recommendations. Pelvic floor disorders have a long latency, and may go through periods of remission, thus making causality difficult to confirm. Nevertheless, prevention strategies targeting modifiable risk factors should be incorporated into clinical practice before the absence of symptomatology.",17
"Resource allocation in the Irish health service, based on historical allocations with incremental increases, is widely believed to be inequitable. Using a three-round policy Delphi survey, which seeks to explore both consensus and disagreement surrounding policy issues, the views of 52 senior health service personnel were sought in order to determine ways to improve equity in resource allocation. Panellists provided several reasons why the current method of resource allocation is inequitable and several suggestions for improving equity. The level of consensus On views was determined by calculating the percentage of ratings in each category based on a series of rating scales. The main suggestion centred around the development and implementation of a needs based resource allocation formula. Panellists reached a high consensus in favour of this but only reached a low consensus as to its feasibility. Potential obstacles identified included methodological difficulties, insufficient resources and resistance from potential losers. These findings highlight concerns about the lack of transparency in the resource allocation process and openness to the development of a more equitable needs based resource allocation model, a move which is becoming more common internationally. Feasibility concerns should not preclude an attempt to begin this process. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",25
"Purpose - This paper seeks to examine whether violence embedded in stories in ads can contribute to advertising effectiveness along the same lines as well-researched ad elements such as the celebrity endorser and the physically attractive ad model. More specifically, the paper aims to assess whether violent content in an ad story adds to excitement perceptions and to overall evaluations such as the attitude toward the ad and the attitude toward the advertised product. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses an experimental approach comprising two studies in which participants were randomly allocated to ads with different levels of violence in an ad story. Findings - The main finding is that representations of real violence (as opposed to staged violence) produced higher levels of excitement, attitude toward the story, attitude toward the ad, and attitude toward the advertised product compared with no violence. Such effects, however, were moderated by the level of congruence between the ad story and the advertised product; the highest response levels were obtained for ads with violent story content dealing explicitly with the advertised product. Originality/value - The finding that violent stories in ads can have a positive charge is consonant with the assumption that violence is a narrative device that may heighten the excitement created by a story. It is also in accord with the observation that many consumers appear to relish stories with a violent content. Yet the main finding challenges existing research on violent ads in which violence consists of an image visually co-exposed with a brand - and it questions the dominant approach in media violence research, which emphasizes the negative effects of media violence.",74
"This study sought to further elucidate the associations between psychopathy and the Fight-Flight-Freeze System (FFFS), Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS), and Behavioral Approach System (BAS) constructs in a large offender sample. More specifically, we examined whether individual differences in these systems would mediate the relationship between psychopathy and externalizing behavior. We used archival data from 823 male and female adult inmates, in which measurements of psychopathy, RST constructs, and externalizing behaviors were available. Path analyses showed that FFFS, over BIS or BAS, mediated the relationship between psychopathy and externalizing behavior. These results further underscore the important role that insensitivity to punishment plays in psychopathy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",73
"Recent advances in materials engineering have enabled photovoltaic (PV) cells to be fabricated from solid state semiconductors, photosensitive organic dyes, and photoactive proteins. One type of organic PV cell is based on the natural light-harvesting protein bacteriorhodopsin (bR) found in the plasma membrane of a salt marsh archaebacteria. When exposed to sunlight, each bR molecule acts as a simple proton pump which transports hydrogen ions from the cytoplasmic to the extracellular side through a transmembrane ion channel. Two types of bR-PV cells comprised of photosensitive dry and aqueous (wet) bR thin films are described in this paper. The self-assembled monolayer of oriented purple membrane (PM) patches from the bR protein is created on a bio-functionalized gold (Au) surface using a biotin molecular recognition technique. The dry bR monolayer is covered with an optically transparent Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) electrode to complete the dry bR-PV device. In contrast, the aqueous bR-PV cell is created by immobilizing the bR monolayer on an Au-coated porous substrate and then inserting the assembly between two micro-reservoirs filled with KCl solutions. Platinum wire probes are then inserted in the opposing liquid reserviors near the porous bR monolayer. The dry bR-PV cell generated a photo-electric response of 9.73 mV/cm(2), while the aqueous bR-PV produced 41.7 mV/cm(2) and 33.3 mu A/cm(2). Although the generated voltages appear small, it may be sufficient to power various microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and microfluidic devices.",89
"Food is a potent natural reward and food intake is a complex process. Reward and gratification associated with food consumption leads to dopamine (DA) production, which in turn activates reward and pleasure centers in the brain. An individual will repeatedly eat a particular food to experience this positive feeling of gratification. This type of repetitive behavior of food intake leads to the activation of brain reward pathways that eventually overrides other signals of satiety and hunger. Thus, a gratification habit through a favorable food leads to overeating and morbid obesity. Overeating and obesity stems from many biological factors engaging both central and peripheral systems in a bi-directional manner involving mood and emotions. Emotional eating and altered mood can also lead to altered food choice and intake leading to overeating and obesity. Research findings from human and animal studies support a two-way link between three concepts, mood, food, and obesity. The focus of this article is to provide an overview of complex nature of food intake where various biological factors link mood, food intake, and brain signaling that engages both peripheral and central nervous system signaling pathways in a bi-directional manner in obesity.",71
"In the Standard Model of particle physics, quarks and anti-quarks have fractional charges equal to +/- 1/3 or +/- 2/3 of the electron's charge. There has been a large number of experiments searching for fractional charge particles using a variety of methods, including dE/dx ionization energy loss measurements in e(+)e collisions, but no evidence has been found to confirm existence of free fractional charge particles, which leads to the quark confinement theory. In this paper, a proposal to search for fractional charge particles is presented, which is based on the conservation law of four-momentum and the Lorentz force law. To show the power of the new strategy, a fully BESIII detector simulated signal sample mixed with a fully simulated background sample is analyzed and lower signal cross section limits to discover 5 sigma signal as a function of quark mass are estimated for the background. The analysis result shows that in comparison with ionization energy loss measurements, the advantage of the strategy is that it can identify fractional charge particles without using any theoretical or empirical formulae to calculate any expected observation values.",44
"Lake Tanganyika has undergone substantial climate-driven lake level fluctuations that have repeatedly changed the distribution and extent of habitat for endemic fishes. Here we consider whether patterns of population genetic structure and phenotypic divergence within the cichlid fish Telmatochromis temporalis have been affected by changing lake levels. The species has a large-bodied rock-living ecomorph and a small-bodied shell-living ecomorph, and both are found in close proximity in littoral habitats. Using mtDNA sequences we found that geographically distant (>50 km) populations within the southern lake region diverged approximately 130,000-230,000 years ago, suggesting that the regional genetic structure persisted through a low stand of over 400 m similar to 106,000 years ago that ended with a rise to present levels similar to 100,000 years ago. We also found signatures of large population expansions since this rise across the study region, suggesting that the populations positively responded to new habitat as lake levels rose to present levels. Finally, we found that geographically adjacent (< 10 km) ecomorphs exhibit both significant genetic differentiation and signatures of gene flow after the lake level rise. The results suggest that local ecomorph divergence progressed with gene flow after the last major rise in lake level similar to 100,000, potentially facilitated by new ecological opportunities.",34
"The potential influence of violent video games on youth violence remains an issue of concern for psychologists, policymakers and the general public. Although several prospective studies of video game violence effects have been conducted, none have employed well validated measures of youth violence, nor considered video game violence effects in context with other influences on youth violence such as family environment, peer delinquency, and depressive symptoms. The current study builds upon previous research in a sample of 302 (52.3% female) mostly Hispanic youth. Results indicated that current levels of depressive symptoms were a strong predictor of serious aggression and violence across most outcome measures. Depressive symptoms also interacted with antisocial traits so that antisocial individuals with depressive symptoms were most inclined toward youth violence. Neither video game violence exposure, nor television violence exposure, were prospective predictors of serious acts of youth aggression or violence. These results are put into the context of criminological data on serious acts of violence among youth.",74
"The stone column is a useful method for increasing the bearing capacity and reducing the settlements of foundations. The confinement provided by the native soft soils has an effective influence on the stone column bearing capacity. In this paper, laboratory tests were performed on unreinforced and reinforced geotextile-encased stone columns. Tests were performed on columns with diameters of 60, 80, and 100 mm and a length to diameter ratio of 5. Vertical encased stone columns (VESC) and horizontal reinforced stone columns (HRSC) were used for stone column reinforcement to investigate the effect of reinforcement type on the bearing capacity. The main objective of this research is to study the efficiency of VESC and HRSC under the same conditions for diameters of 60, 80, and 100 mm. Experimental results show that the bearing capacity of stone columns increases using vertical or horizontal reinforcing material. Moreover, the bearing capacity of reinforced stone columns increases by increasing the strength of reinforcement in both VESC and HRSC. Results show that bulging failure mechanism governed in all tests and that lateral bulging decreases using geotextiles and increasing strength of reinforcement. In addition, for both VESC and HRSC, the stress concentration ratio of the columns also increases.",93
"The efficacy of transdermal fentanyl for cancer pain and chronic non-cancer pain (chronic lower back pain, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, neuropathic pain) is well established. Several formulations of fentanyl transdermal systems have been developed to improve the drug delivery and prevent misuse of the active principle. The addition of a rate controlling membrane to the matrix system represented an important advance. The design and functional features of Alghedon patch are compared with other approved generic fentanyl transdermal systems, emphasizing the distinctiveness of Alghedon patch. Alghedon patch has no liquid component in the finished product, therefore no leakage of active ingredient from the system can occur. A rate-controlling membrane provides controlled release of the active substance from the matrix reservoir, ensuring that fentanyl delivery and entry into the microcirculation is not solely controlled by the skin's permeability to this active substance. Alghedon patch contains part of the drug (approximately 15%) in the skin-contact adhesive: this innovative solution allows to overcome a typical drawback of transdermal patches, i.e. the long lag-time before the drug appears in plasma after the first administration, and provides rapid analgesia during the first hours of administration. Alghedon Fentanyl Transdermal System employs materials commonly used in other transdermal applications and having established safety profiles. For each strength level, the fentanyl content - and, thus, the resulting residual fentanyl remaining in the patch after use - is at the lowest end of the range used in commercially available fentanyl patches, minimizing the potential for abuse and misuse.",15
"Host defence peptides (HDPs) are short, cationic amphipathic peptides that play a key role in the response to infection and inflammation in all complex life forms. It is increasingly emerging that HDPs generally have a modest direct activity against a broad range of microorganisms, and that their anti infective properties are mainly due to their ability to modulate the immune response. Here, we report the recombinant production and characterization of two novel HDPs identified in human Apolipoprotein B (residues 887-922) by using a bioinformatics method recently developed by our group. We focused our attention on two variants of the identified HDP, here named r(P)ApoB(L) and r(P)ApoB(s), 38- and 26-residue long, respectively. Both HDPs were found to be endowed with a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity while they show neither toxic nor haemolytic effects towards eukaryotic cells. Interestingly, both HDPs were found to display a significant anti-biofilm activity, and to act in synergy with either commonly used antibiotics or EDTA. The latter was selected for its ability to affect bacterial outer membrane permeability, and to sensitize bacteria to several antibiotics. Circular dichroism analyses showed that SDS, TFE, and LPS significantly alter r(P)ApoBL conformation, whereas slighter or no significant effects were detected in the case of r(P)ApoBs peptide. Interestingly, both ApoB derived peptides were found to elicit anti-inflammatory effects, being able to mitigate the production of pro inflammatory interleukin-6 and nitric oxide in LPS induced murine macrophages. It should also be emphasized that r(P)ApoBL peptide was found to play a role in human keratinocytes wound closure in vitro. Altogether, these findings open interesting perspectives on the therapeutic use of the herein identified HDPs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",42
"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in women at advanced age, who are affected a decade later compared to men. Cardiovascular risk factors in women are not properly investigated nor treated and events are frequently lethal. Both menopause and type 2 diabetes substantially increase cardiovascular risk in the female sex, promoting modifications on lipid metabolism and circulating lipoproteins. Lipoprotein subfractions suffer a shift after menopause towards a more atherogenic lipid profile, consisted of hypertriglyceridemia, lower levels of both total high density lipoprotein (HDL) and its subfraction HDL2, but also higher levels of HDL3 and small low-density lipoprotein particles. This review discusses the impact of diabetes and menopause to the lipid profile, challenges in lipoprotein subfractions determination and their potential contribution to the cardiovascular risk assessment in women. It is still unclear whether lipoprotein subfraction changes are a major driver of cardiometabolic risk and which modifications are predominant. Prospective trials with larger samples, methodological standardizations and pharmacological approaches are needed to clarify the role of lipoprotein subfractions determination on cardiovascular risk prediction and intervention planning in postmenopausal women, with or without DM.",129
"Our purpose was to identify causative mutations and characterize the phenotype associated with the genotype in 10 unrelated families with autosomal recessive retinal degeneration. Ophthalmic evaluation and DNA isolation were carried out in 10 pedigrees with inherited retinal degenerations (IRD). Exomes of probands from eight pedigrees were captured using Nimblegen V2/V3 or Agilent V5 + UTR kits, and sequencing was performed on Illumina HiSeq. The DHDDS gene was screened for mutations in the remaining two pedigrees with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Exome variants were filtered to detect candidate causal variants using exomeSuite software. Segregation and ethnicity-matched control sample analysis were performed by dideoxy sequencing. Retinal histology of a patient with DHDDS mutation was studied by microscopy. Genetic analysis identified six known mutations in ABCA4 (p.Gly1961Glu, p.Ala1773Val, c.5461-10T>C), RPE65 (p.Tyr249Cys, p.Gly484Asp), PDE6B (p.Lys706Ter) and DHDDS (p.Lys42Glu) and ten novel potentially pathogenic variants in CERKL (p.Met323Val fsX20), RPE65 (p.Phe252Ser, Thr454Leu fsX31), ARL6 (p.Arg121His), USH2A (p.Gly3142Ter, p.Cys3294Trp), PDE6B (p.Gln652Ter), and DHDDS (p.Thr206Ala) genes. Among these, variants/mutations in two separate genes were observed to segregate with IRD in two pedigrees. Retinal histopathology of a patient with a DHDDS mutation showed severe degeneration of retinal layers with relative preservation of the retinal pigment epithelium. Analysis of exome variants in ten pedigrees revealed nine novel potential disease-causing variants and nine previously reported homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the CERKL, ABCA4, RPE65, ARL6, USH2A, PDE6B, and DHDDS genes. Mutations that could be sufficient to cause pathology were observed in more than one gene in one pedigree.",34
"A systematic review of scientific articles about violence against women and / or situations where women are treated under the traditional prism of gender roles in Spanish films is presented in this investigation, allowing these situations that aggressive acts remain framed, exclusively, in the domestic sphere. Surprisingly, in all articles and film reviews that focus on women roles and / or women violence, the famous film Amanece, que no es poco by Jose Luis Cuerda is not even mentioned as a simple example of Spanish film where gender violence is evident.",77
"In order to make the dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) concurrently compensate for low-order harmonics and voltage sag, and eliminate the influence of digital control on system performance, we propose a novel double closed-loop digital control strategy, consisting of the fundamental proportional resonant (PR) control in a voltage loop and selective harmonic PR control in an inductance current loop. Then, we mainly analyse the discretization effects of the virtual LC method and the step response method, and further present a straightforward digital design method. Next, with this method, we design the parameters of the fundamental and selective harmonic PR controllers in the discrete domain, which inhibit the influence of sampling, calculation delay etc. on the steady-state error and the dynamic response performance. Finally, an 11-kVA DVR prototype is developed and tested. The experimental results indicate that the proposed control strategy satisfies the requirement of voltage quality for sensitive loads and achieves a good dynamic response performance.",48
"Distributed Generation (DG) brought new challenges for protection engineers since standard relay settings of traditional system may no longer function correctly under the new conditions of DG. The extreme case is coordination loss between primary and backup relays. The directional overcurrent relay (DOCR) which is the most implemented protection device in the electrical network also suffers performance degradation in presence of DG. Therefore, the paper proposes the mitigation of DG impact on DOCR coordination employing adaptive protection scheme (APS) using differential evolution algorithm (DE). The impacts of DG prior and after the application of APS are presented and a new mitigation scheme is proposed.",50
"Background: Age-related sarcopenia can cause various forms of physical disabilities. We investigated how sarcopenia affects degenerative lumbar scoliosis (DLS) and lumbar spinal canal stenosis (LSCS). Methods: Subjects comprised 40 elderly women (mean age 74 years) with spinal disease whose chief complaints were low back pain and lower limb pain. They included 15 cases of DLS (mean 74.8 years) and 25 cases of LSCS (mean age 72.9 years). We performed whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to analyze body composition, including appendicular and trunk skeletal muscle mass index (SMI; lean mass (kg)/height (m)(2)) and bone mineral density (BMD). A diagnostic criterion for sarcopenia was an appendicular SMI10 degrees and a sagittal vertical axis (SVA) >50 mm. Sarcopenia prevalence, correlations between spinal alignment, BMD, and clinical symptoms with appendicular and trunk SMIs, and correlation between spinal alignment and clinical symptoms were investigated. Results: DLS cases had significantly lower body weight, BMI, lean mass arm, and total lean mass than LSCS cases. Sarcopenia prevalence rates were 4/25 cases (16%) in LSCS and 7/15 cases (46.6%) in DLS, revealing a high prevalence in DLS. Appendicular SMIs were DLS 5.61 and LSCS 6.13 (p < 0.05), and trunk SMIs were DLS 6.91 and LSCS 7.61 (p < 0.01) showing DLS to have significantly lower values than LSCS. Spinal alignment correlations revealed the appendicular SMI was negatively correlated with PT (p < 0.05) and the trunk SMI was found to have a significant negative correlation with SVA, PT, LS, and VRA (p < 0.05). The trunk SMI was found to have a significant positive correlation with BMD (p < 0.05). As for clinical symptoms, RDQ was negatively correlated with appendicular SMI and positively correlated with PT (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Sarcopenia complications were noted in 16% of LSCS patients and a much higher percentage, or 46. 6%, of DLS patients. Appendicular and trunk SMIs were both lower in DLS, suggesting that sarcopenia may be involved in scoliosis. The appendicular skeletal muscle was related to posterior pelvic tilt, while the trunk muscle affected stooped posture, posterior pelvic tilt, lumbar scoliosis, and vertebral rotation. Decreases in trunk muscle mass were also associated with osteoporosis. Moreover, RDQ had a negative correlation with appendicular skeletal muscle mass and a positive correlation with PT, suggesting that sarcopenia may be associated with low back pain as a result of posterior pelvic tilt. Our research reveals for the first time how sarcopenia is involved in spinal deformations, suggesting decreases in pelvic/lumbar support structures such as trunk and appendicular muscle mass may be involved in the progression of spinal deformities and increased low back pain.",16
"The presence of higher order harmonics causes problems in the quality and efficiency of energy supply by voltages sinusoidal inverters (VSI) to pulse-width-modulated (PWM) of the asynchronous motors drives, widely used in industry. This paper proposes an artificial neural network that identifies the quality of the sine wave and calculates the efficiency of electric drive system according to the index modulation of the sine wave voltage delivered to the electric motor, along with inverters modulated devices semiconductors (IGBTs). Also shown the effect on the efficiency of the operation of the harmonic losses.",53
"The development of organic materials for visible light driven photocatalytic is regarded as one of the most promising avenues to solve environment and solar-energy utilization issue. Here, we present that one-dimensional supramolecular organic nanofibers, self-assembled by a carboxy-substituent perylene diimide (PDI) molecule through H-type pi-pi stacking and hydrogen bonding, can act as a robust and effective photocatalyst for both organic pollutants degradation and water oxidation under visible light without the apparent need for an added metal co-catalysts. We corroborate that the highly efficient and stable activity of such supramolecar photocatalyst are attributed to the introduction of terminal carboxyl group, which leads to well-defined and stable H-type pi-pi stacking, and constructs the internal electric field in supramolecular nanofibers, thereby resulting in the deepening of valence band (VB) and the enhancement of migration and separation efficiency of photo-induced charge carriers. Our findings may help the development of semiconducting-based organic supramolecular materials for applications in environment protection and water splitting. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"Objective: More women have Alzheimer's disease (AD) than men. Understanding sex differences in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may further knowledge of AD etiology and prevention. We conducted a meta analysis to examine sex differences in the prevalence and incidence of MCI, which included amnestic and non-amnestic subtypes. Method: Systematic searches were performed in July 2015 using MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO for population-or community-based studies with MCI data for men and women. Random-effects model were used. Results: Fifty-six studies were included. There were no statistically significant sex differences in prevalence or incidence of amnestic MCI. There was a significantly higher prevalence (p = 0.038), but not incidence, of non-amnestic MCI among women. There were no sex differences in studies that combined both subtypes of MCI. Conclusion: The only statistically significant finding emerging from this study was that women have a higher prevalence of non-amnestic MCI. To better understand sex differences in the preclinical stages of dementia, studies must better characterize the etiology of the cognitive impairment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",119
"Tetrahydroprotoberberines (THPB) have a high affinity for dopamine (DA) D1 and D2 receptors and may provide a novel treatment for drug addiction. We assessed the effects of the THPB D-govadine on the acquisition, expression, extinction and reinstatement of D-amphetamine -(1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) induced conditioned place preference (CPP). Furthermore, the effects of D-govadine on conditioned association between contextual stimuli and a natural reward were examined using food-induced CPP. In separate experiments, rats received D-govadine (0, 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) before a) each D-amphetamine injection during conditioning, b) expression of amphetamine-induced CPP, c) each extinction session, d) amphetamine-induced reinstatement of CPP, ore) placement into a compartment containing food during conditioning. Although D-govadine had no effect on acquisition of amphetamine CPP, treatment with D-govadine during acquisition dose-dependently extinguished a preference for the amphetamine-associated context more quickly than vehicle treatment. Moreover, D-govadine treatment facilitated the extinction of amphetamine CPP when given repeatedly throughout the extinction phase. Although the expression of amphetamine CPP was not affected by D-govadine administered prior to the expression test, amphetamine-induced reinstatement of CPP following an extinction period was blocked by D-govadine (1.0 mg/kg). The intermediate dose of D-govadine blocked the acquisition of food CPP, whereas the high dose facilitated extinction of this preference as compared to vehicle-treated animals. Therefore, D-govadine attenuates the maintenance of conditioned associations between contextual stimuli and amphetamine or food reward, as well as amphetamine-induced reinstatement of drug seeking behaviour. As such, D-govadine may be a candidate for further development as a pharmacological treatment of psychostimulant drug dependence. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",104
"Invasion into new areas by already widespread pest organisms often occurs through non-obvious routes, with the origins of such invasions difficult to determine. Understanding population structure using multiple datatypes can help untangle past dispersal events and reveal putative contemporary invasion pathways. The tephritid fruit fly, Zeugodacus cucurbitae (Coquillett), is a serious pest of cucurbits and other commercial crops and is considered native to the Indo-Oriental region, but is invasive in both Africa and the Pacific. Here, we combine molecular (microsatellites and COI) and morphological (male genetalia length and wing shape geometric morphometrics) data within an integrative taxonomic framework to test hypotheses concerning levels of Z. cucurbitae population variation observed in Southeast Asia (native range, 10 sites, similar to 200 individuals) versus the West Pacific (invasive range, 4 sites, similar to 80 individuals), and whether single or multiple introductions of Z. cucurbitae have occurred into the West Pacific. We also use this case to explicitly test if using an integrative approach provides more information about hypothesized invasion pathways than either genetic or morphological approaches would do alone. All datasets support Z. cucurbitae as being more variable in Southeast Asia than the West Pacific, and within these regions populations appear to be structured geographically. In particular, mainland and Sundaic Southeast Asian locations formed separate clusters, and New Guinea and Solomon Islands were not closely related to Guam and Hawaii. Evidence supports a separate single origin for New Guinea from the Melanesian arc, the Solomon Islands from Malaysia/Singapore, and Guam from mainland Asia, but multiple introductions into Hawaii from mainland Asia. Taken together, we argue that there is great value in integrating evidence from multiple sources as it can provide finer resolution of population relationships than any single data source alone.",34
"Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a heterogeneous chronic inflammatory disease with a broad clinical spectrum and variable course. It can involve musculoskeletal structures as well as skin, nails, eyes, and gut. The management of PsA has changed tremendously in the last decade, thanks to an earlier diagnosis, an advancement in pharmacological therapies, and a wider application of a multidisciplinary approach. The commercialization of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, and infliximab) as well as interleukin (IL)-12/23 (ustekinumab) and IL-17 (secukinumab) inhibitors is representative of a revolution in the treatment of PsA. No evidence-based strategies are currently available for guiding the rheumatologist to prescribe biological drugs. Several international and national recommendation sets are currently available with the aim to help rheumatologists in everyday clinical practice management of PsA patients treated with biological therapy. Since no specific biological agent has been demonstrated to be more effective than others, the drug choice should be made according to the available safety data, the presence of extra-articular manifestations, the patient's preferences (e.g., administration route), and the drug price. However, future studies directly comparing different biological drugs and assessing the efficacy of treatment strategies specific for PsA are urgently needed.",22
"We previously demonstrated that serotonin (5-HT) and 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) levels in platelets were up- or down-regulated after myocardial infarction (MI) associated with depression. In this study, we further evaluated the effects of pretreatment with ginseng fruit saponins (GFS) on the expression of 5-HT and 5-HT2AR in MI with or without depression. Eighty Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were treated with saline and GFS (n=40 per group). The animals were then randomly divided into four subgroups: sham, MI, depression, and MI + depression (n=10 per subgroup). Protein levels of 5-HT and 5-HT2AR in the serum, platelets and brain tissues were determined with ELISA. The results demonstrated that serum 5-HT levels was significantly increased by GFS pretreatment in all subgroups (except the sham subgroup) when compared with saline-treated counterparts (p<0.01). In platelets, GFS pretreatment significantly increased 5-HT levels in all subgroups when compared with their respective saline-treated counterparts (p<0.01). Brain 5-HT levels also declined with GFS pretreatment in the MI-only and depression-only subgroups (p<0.05 vs. saline pretreatment). With respect to 5-HT2AR levels, platelet 5-HT2AR was decreased in GFS pretreated MI, depression and MI + depression subgroups (p<0.01 vs. saline pretreatment). Similarly, brain 5-HT2AR levels decreased in all four subgroups pretreated with GFS (p<0.01 vs. saline pretreatment). We conclude that GFS plays a clear role in modulating 5-HT and 5-HT2AR expressions after MI and depression. Although the effects of GFS on brain 5-HT remain to be elucidated, its therapeutic potential for comorbidities of acute cardiovascular events and depression appears to hold much promise.",69
"Trauma, especially early life trauma, is a risk factor for the development of both posttraumatic stress disorder and psychosis. The goal of the present study was to determine specific associations between exposure to childhood abuse, PTSD symptoms, and current psychotic disorder. Subjects were recruited from a public, urban hospital (N = 328, >90% African American). Psychotic disorders were measured using the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview, PTSD was measured using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale, child abuse was measured with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, and lifetime trauma exposure was measured with the Traumatic Events Inventory. Logistic regression analyses showed that both child abuse and current PTSD were statistically significant predictors of psychotic disorder beyond the effects of lifetime trauma load. When PTSD symptom clusters were examined, avoidance and numbing symptoms showed unique association with psychotic disorder independent of demographic variables and trauma exposure. Using bootstrapping techniques, we found a full indirect effect of PTSD on the association between child abuse and, suggesting a particularly important role of PTSD symptoms in relation to psychotic disorder in the presence of early life trauma. Because this is a cross-sectional study, continued research is needed to determine causality of such models. Identifying co-occurring psychosis and PTSD, particularly in populations with high levels of trauma exposure, is critical and will likely aid in more successful treatment interventions.

"PLP is well-regarded for its role as a coenzyme in a number of diverse enzymatic reactions. Transamination, deoxygenation, and aldol reactions mediated by PLP-dependent enzymes enliven and enrich deoxy sugar biosynthesis, endowing these compounds with unique structures and contributing to their roles as determinants of biological activity in many natural products. The importance of deoxy aminosugars in natural product biosynthesis has spurred several recent structural investigations of sugar aminotransferases. The structure of a PMP-dependent enzyme catalyzing the C-3 deoxygenation reaction in the biosynthesis of ascarylose was also determined. These studies, and the crystal structures they have provided, offer a wealth of new insights regarding the enzymology of PLP/PMP-dependent enzymes in deoxy sugar biosynthesis. In this review, we consider these recent achievements in the structural biology of deoxy sugar biosynthetic enzymes and the important implications they hold for understanding enzyme catalysis and natural product biosynthesis in general.

"In this research, an internal model based method is proposed to estimate the displacement profile of a bridge subjected to a moving traffic load using a combination of acceleration and strain measurements. The structural response is assumed to be within the linear range. The deflection profile is assumed to be dominated by the fundamental mode of the bridge, therefore only requiring knowledge of the first mode. This still holds true under a multiple vehicle loading situation as the high mode shapes don't impact the over all response of the structure. Using the structural modal parameters and partial knowledge of the moving vehicle load, the internal models of the structure and the moving load can be respectively established, which can be used to form an autonomous state-space representation of the system. The structural displacements, velocities, and accelerations are the states of such a system, and it is fully observable when the measured output contains structural accelerations and strains. Reliable estimates of structural displacements are obtained using the standard Kalman filtering technique. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method has been demonstrated and evaluated via numerical simulation of a simply supported single span concrete bridge subjected to a moving traffic load.",58
"The Canadian Association of Gastroenterology and the Canadian Digestive Health Foundation published guidelines on colon cancer screening in 2004. Subsequent to the publication of these guidelines, many advances have occurred, thereby necessitating a review of the existing guidelines in the context of new technologies and clinical knowledge. The assembled guideline panel recognized three recent American sets of guidelines and identified seven issues that required comment from a Canadian perspective. These issues included, among others, the role of program-based screening, flexible sigmoidoscopy, computed tomography colonography, barium enema and quality improvement. The panel also provided context for the selection of the fecal immunochemical test as the fecal occult blood test of choice, and the relative role of colonoscopy as a primary screening tool. Recommendations were also provided for an upper age limit for colon cancer screening, whether upper endoscopy should be performed following a negative colonoscopy for a positive fecal occult blood test and when colon cancer screening should resume following negative colonoscopy.",122
"Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are diagnosed and classified using the Rome criteria; the criteria may change over time as new scientific data emerge. The Rome IV was released in May 2016. The aim is to review the main changes in Rome IV. FGIDs are now called disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI). Rome IV has a multicultural rather than a Western-culture focus. There are new chapters including multicultural, age-gender-women's health, intestinal microenvironment, biopsychosocial, and centrally mediated disorders. New disorders have been included although not truly FGIDs, but fit the new definition of DGBI including opioid-induced gastrointestinal hyperalgesia, opioid-induced constipation, and cannabinoid hyperemesis. Also, new FGIDs based on available evidence including reflux hypersensitivity and centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome. Using a normative survey to determine the frequency of normal bowel symptoms in the general population changes in the time frame for diagnosis were introduced. For irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) only pain is required and discomfort was eliminated because it is non-specific, having different meanings in different languages. Pain is now related to bowel movements rather than just improving with bowel movements (ie, can get worse with bowel movement). Functional bowel disorders ( functional diarrhea, functional constipation, IBS with predominant diarrhea [IBS-D], IBS with predominant constipation [IBS-C], and IBS with mixed bowel habits) are considered to be on a continuum rather than as independent entities. Clinical applications such as diagnostic algorithms and the Multidimensional Clinical Profile have been updated. The new Rome IV iteration is evidence-based, multicultural oriented and with clinical applications. As new evidence become available, future updates are expected.",4
"Mode I fracture is one of three primary macroscopic fracture modes, which is the most common tensile fracture. The mode I crack propagates in a direction normal to the applied stress. Micro cracks, voids, inclusions, segregation and second phases in materials are unavoidable, which affect directly the strength of materials. Hence, stress fields in mode I crack and its tip became focus of this fracture type. Gurson, Tvergaad and Needleman (GTN) developed the constitutive model which has taken into account voids, micro cracks, inclusion, etc. in materials. This model reasonably illustrated the brittle fracture to some extend. Numerical analysis of infinite plate with mode I crack employed GTN model has been conducted and completed in this paper with the help of FEM software ABAQUS. The length of crack was 20mm (a=20mm) and the curvature in the tip of crack was r=10(-5) m. The dimensions of plate which subjected to uniform stress at two ends were 40a long and 20a wide. The material of plate was typical elastic-plastic materials. The distributions of stresses, strains and values of damage at the tip of crack was obtained by the FEM software. The process of propagation of crack was completely simulated by the method of element failure.",91
"Requirement prioritization are considered crucial towards the development of successful and high quality software. Nowadays, most software development project and people in software industries are confronted with the challenge of implementing a large scale, complex and dynamic software applications. Hence, the need to use a requirement prioritization technique which able to deliver a right set of requirement seems very crucial. The available techniques still suffer from several weaknesses. This motivate us to identify comprehensively what are the limitations and future directions of the existing requirement prioritization techniques. In this study, we conducted an in-depth software engineering based Systematic Literature Review, as it helps to execute a thorough and fair literature review due to its predefined review protocol. We gathered a list of 55 requirement prioritization techniques and investigate the limitation and weaknesses each one of this technique. Findings from this study later will be used to design a new effective and efficient requirement prioritization technique.",123
"Self-healing materials are able to repair themselves automatically after external normal damages. This special property of self-healing materials could enhance the service life and ensure more safety while using such materials especially mechanically. Therefore, it has become a new emerging smart material which has the specialty to manage damages instead of traditional materials to avoid it. Self-healing hydrogels based on constitutional dynamic chemistry have received a lot of attentions recently with their intrinsic dynamic structures namely cross-linked polymer networks by dynamic bonds. Dynamic chemistry bonds contain both non-covalent bonds and reversible covalent bonds. Non-covalent bonds (weak effects) include hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, coordinative bonds, hydrophobic effects, etc. Reversible covalent bonds usually include those chemistry bonds that could be reversible in mild conditions as imine bonds, disulfide bonds, acylhydrazone bonds and so on. Those hydrogels with dynamic cross-linked networks could not only manage external damages and repair themselves as self-healing materials but also gain multi-responsive properties to environmental stimuli. The latter specialty comes from the adptive property of dynamic bonds to react to changes of reaction environments like pH, temperature and chemical reactants, thus building the foundation to develop self-healing hydrogels further into a multi-functional self-adaptive smart soft matter, which is of great significance for research to enrich multi-functional materials. Besides, hydrogel as a soft matter have long been vastly used in biomedical applications due to their superior biocompatibility and resemblance to biological tissues as mainly components (usually more than 70%) of hydrogel are water. They are playing a more and more important role in biomedical applications such as drug delivery systems, cell culture, tissue engineering and manmade biomimetic materials. Developing multi-functional smart soft matter with self-healing property as self-healing hydrogels would be quite helpful to this emerging field with unexpected more biomedical materials. This paper reviews recent works about self-healing hydrogels based on dynamic chemistry and their future biomedical applications. Systems based on multiple-hydrogen bonds, coordination effects, hydrophobic effects, acylhydrazone bonds and imine bonds are specifically discussed.",103
"DAMPE (DArk Matter Particle Explorer) is a scientific satellite which is mainly aimed at indirectly searching for dark matter in space. One critical sub-detector of the DAMPE payload is the BGO (bismuth germanium oxide) calorimeter, which contains 1848 PMT (photomultiplier tube) dynodes and 16 FEE (Front-End Electronics) boards. VA160 and VATA160, two 32-channel low power ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits), are adopted as the key components on the FEEs to perform charge measurement for the PMT signals. In order to monitor the parameter drift which may be caused by temperature variation, aging, or other environmental factors, an onboard calibration circuit is designed for the VA160 and VATA160 ASICs. It is mainly composed of a 12-bit DAC (Digital to Analog Converter), an operational amplifier and an analog switch. Test results showed that a dynamic range of 0-30 pC with a precision of 5 fC (Root Meam Square, RMS) was achieved, which covers the VA160's input range. It can be used to compensate for the temperature drift and test the trigger function of the FEEs. The calibration circuit has been implemented for the front-end electronics of the BGO Calorimeter and verified by all the environmental tests for both Qualification Model and Flight Model of DAMPE. The DAMPE satellite was launched at the end of 2015 and the calibration circuit will operate periodically in space.",60
"This paper presents the design and project of an innovative concept for a Single Point Incremental Forming (SPIF) Machine. Nowadays, equipment currently available for conducting SPIF result mostly from the adaptation of conventional CNC machine tools that results in a limited range of applications in terms of materials and geometries. There is also a limited market supply of equipment dedicated to Incremental Sheet Forming (ISF), that are costly considering low batches, making it unattractive for industry. Other factors impairing a quicker spread of SPIF are large forming times and poor geometrical accuracy of parts. The following sections will depict the development of a new equipment, designed to overcome some of the limitations of machines currently used, allowing the development of a sounding basis for further studies on the particular features of this process. The equipment here described possesses six-degrees-of freedom for the tool, for the sake of improved flexibility in terms of achievable tool-paths and an extra stiffness provided by a parallel kinematics scheme. A brief state of the art about the existing SPIF machines is provided to support the project's guidelines.",85
"Telomeres at the ends of human chromosomes consist of tandem hexametric (TTAGGG)n repeats, which protect them from degradation. At each cycle of cell division, most normal somatic cells lose approximately 50-100 bp of the terminal telomeric repeat DNA. Precise prediction of growth and estimation of the malignant potential of brain tumors require additional markers. DNA extraction was performed from the 51 frozen tissues, and a non-radioactive chemiluminescent assay was used for Southern blotting. One sample t-test shows highly significant difference in telomere length in meningioma and astrocytoma with normal range. According to our results, higher grades of meningioma and astrocytoma tumors show more heterogeneity in telomere length, and also it seems shortening process of telomeres is an early event in brain tumors.",39
"In this paper, we investigate the linear superposition principle of exponential traveling waves to construct a sub-class of N-wave solutions of Hirota bilinear equations. A necessary and sufficient condition for Hirota bilinear equations possessing this specific sub-class of N-wave solutions is presented. We apply this result to find N-wave solutions to the (2 + 1)-dimensional KP equation, a (3 + 1)-dimensional generalized Kadomtsev Petviashvili (KP) equation, a (3 + 1)-dimensional generalized BKP equation and the (2 + 1)-dimensional BKP equation. The inverse question, i.e., constructing Hirota Bilinear equations possessing N-wave solutions, is considered and a refined 3-step algorithm is proposed. As examples, we construct two very general kinds of Hirota bilinear equations of order 4 possessing N-wave solutions among which one satisfies dispersion relation and another does not satisfy dispersion relation.",24
"Our systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies indicated that the use of antipsychotics was associated with a nearly 1.5-fold increase in the risk of fracture. First-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) appeared to carry a higher risk of fracture than second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs). The risk of fractures associated with the use of antipsychotic medications has inconsistent evidence between different drug classes. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate whether there is an association between the use of antipsychotic drugs and fractures. Searches were conducted through the PubMed and EMBASE databases to identify observational studies that had reported a quantitative estimate of the association between use of antipsychotics and fractures. The summary risk was derived from random effects meta-analysis. The search yielded 19 observational studies (n = 544,811 participants) with 80,835 fracture cases. Compared with nonuse, use of FGAs was associated with a significantly higher risk for hip fractures (OR 1.67, 95% CI, 1.45-1.93), and use of second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) was associated with an attenuated but still significant risk for hip fractures (OR 1.33, 95% CI, 1.11-1.58). The risk of fractures associated with individual classes of antipsychotic users was heterogeneous, and odds ratios ranged from 1.24 to 2.01. Chlorpromazine was associated with the highest risk (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.43-2.83), while Risperidone was associated with the lowest risk of fracture (OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.95-1.83). FGA users were at a higher risk of hip fracture than SGA users. Both FGAs and SGAs were associated with an increased risk of fractures, especially among the older population. Therefore, the benefit of the off-label use of antipsychotics in elderly patients should be weighed against any risks for fracture.",72
"This study aims at presenting the process of machine design and agricultural implements by means of a reference model, formulated with the purpose of explaining the development activities of new products, serving as a guideline to coach human resources and to assist in formalizing the process in small and medium-sized businesses (SMB), i.e. up to 500 employees. The methodology used included the process modeling, carried out from case studies in the SMB, and the study of reference models in literature. The modeling formalism used was based on the IDEF0 standard, which identifies the dimensions required for the model detailing: input information; activities; tasks; knowledge domains; mechanisms; controls and information produced. These dimensions were organized in spreadsheets and graphs. As a result, a reference model with 27 activities and 71 tasks was obtained, distributed over four phases of the design process. The evaluation of the model was carried out by the companies participating in the case studies and by experts, who concluded that the model explains the actions needed to develop new products in SMB.",85

"The primary focus of the current research is goal projection or the ascription of a perceiver's own goal onto an interaction partner (i.e., target). Extending the finding that perceivers project their goal onto a target (Kawada, Oettingen, Gollwitzer, & Bargh, 2004), two studies applied a cognitive conceptualization of goal pursuit and detection to explain boundary conditions for goal projection in conversation. Experiment 1 demonstrated that the strength of the cognitive association between perceivers' goal and the social context moderated projection: Projection was greater for strongly than moderately or weakly linked goals. Experiment 2 established that the target's goal pursuit efficiency and the congruency between the perceiver's and the target's goals influenced projection: Compared with targets' efficient pursuit of nonidentical goals, projection was greater (a) when the target and perceiver had the same goal regardless of efficiency or (b) when they had different goals but the target was inefficient.",63
"Autonomous mobile service robots move in our buildings, carrying out different tasks across multiple floors. While moving and performing their tasks, these robots find themselves in a variety of states. Although speech is often used for communicating the robot's state to humans, such communication can often be ineffective. We investigate the use of lights as a persistent visualization of the robot's state in relation to both tasks and environmental factors. Programmable lights offer a large degree of choices in terms of animation pattern, color and speed. We present this space of choices and introduce different animation profiles that we consider to animate a set of programmable lights on the robot. We conduct experiments to query about suitable animations for three representative scenarios of our autonomous symbiotic robot, CoBot. Ourwork enables CoBot tomake its state persistently visible to humans.",64
"Enzymes are tremendously proficient catalysts, which can be used as extracellular catalysts for a whole host of processes, from chemical synthesis to the generation of novel biofuels. For them to be more amenable to the needs of biotechnology, however, it is often necessary to be able to manipulate their physico-chemical properties in an efficient and streamlined manner, and, ideally, to be able to train them to catalyze completely new reactions. Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in different approaches to achieve this, both in the laboratory, and in silico. There remains, however, a gap between current approaches to computational enzyme design, which have primarily focused on the early stages of the design process, and laboratory evolution, which is an extremely powerful tool for enzyme redesign, but will always be limited by the vastness of sequence space combined with the low frequency for desirable mutations. This review discusses different approaches towards computational enzyme design and demonstrates how combining newly developed screening approaches that can rapidly predict potential mutation ""hotspots"" with approaches that can quantitatively and reliably dissect the catalytic step can bridge the gap that currently exists between computational enzyme design and laboratory evolution studies.",36
"Execution plans constitute the traditional interface between DBMS front-ends and back-ends; similar networks of interconnected operators are found also outside database systems. Tasks like adapting execution plans for distributed or heterogeneous runtime environments require a plan transformation mechanism which is simple enough to produce predictable results while general enough to express advanced communication schemes required for instance in skew-resistant partitioning. In this paper, we describe the BobolangNG language designed to express execution plans as well as their transformations, based on hierarchical models known from many environments but enhanced with a novel compile-time mechanism of component multiplication. Compared to approaches based on general graph rewriting, the plan transformation in BobolangNG is not iterative; therefore the consequences and limitations of the process are easier to understand and the development of distribution strategies and experimenting with distributed plans are easier and safer.",2
"Reduced-scale shaking table testing is a useful tool for understanding the seismic behavior of geosynthetic-reinforced soil walls. This paper presents the results from a series of reduced-scale shaking table tests on eight different configurations. The effects of change in peak ground acceleration, reinforcement length and spacing, model scale, treatment of the top two facing block layers on the accelerations on a wall face, maximum displacements of the wall face during shaking, permanent displacements, and strains in reinforcement are investigated. Maximum accelerations measured on the wall face during shaking increased from bottom to top. Geotextile length and spacing did not affect the maximum accelerations and face displacements when the geotextile length met the minimum requirements of established design procedures. No significant permanent displacements were observed. Decreasing the geotextile length and increasing the geotextile spacing increased the geotextile strains when the geotextile was long enough to provide anchorage beyond the potential failure surface.

"Context: The Functional Movement Screen (FMS) evaluates performance in 7 fundamental movement patterns using a 4-point scale. Previous studies have reported increased injury risk with a composite score (CS) of 14/21 or less; these studies were limited to specific sports and injury definition. Objective: To examine the association between FMS CS and movement pattern scores and acute noncontact and overuse musculoskeletal injuries in division I college athletes. An exploratory objective was to assess the association between injury and FMS movement pattern asymmetry. Design: Prospective cohort. Setting: College athletic facilities. Participants: 167 injury-free, college basketball, football, volleyball, cross country, track and field, swimming/diving, soccer, golf, and tennis athletes (males = 89). Intervention: The FMS was administered during preparticipation examination. Main Outcome Measure: Noncontact or overuse injuries that required intervention from the athletic trainer during the sport season. Results: FMS CS was not different between those injured (n = 74; 14.3 +/- 2.5) and those not (14.1 +/- 2.4; P =.57). No point on the ROC curve maximized sensitivity and specificity; therefore previously published cut-point was used for analysis with injury (= 14 [n = 92]). After adjustment, no statistically significant association between FMS CS and injury (odds ratio [OR] = 1.01, 95% CI 0.53-1.91) existed. Lunge was the only movement pattern that was associated with injury; those scoring 2 were less likely to have an injury vs those who scored 3 (OR = 0.21, 95% CI 0.08-0.59). There was also no association between FMS movement pattern asymmetry and injury. Conclusion: FMS CS, movement patterns, and asymmetry were poor predictors of noncontact and overuse injury in this cohort of division I athletes.",27
"Moderate exposure to alcohol during development leads to subtle neurobiological and behavioral effects classified under the umbrella term fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Alterations in social behaviors are a frequently observed consequence of maternal drinking, as children with FASDs display inappropriate aggressive behaviors and altered responses to social cues. Rodent models of FASDs mimic the behavioral alterations seen in humans, with rats exposed to ethanol during development displaying increased aggressive behaviors, decreased social investigation, and altered play behavior. Work from our laboratory has observed increased wrestling behavior in adult male rats following prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), and increased expression of GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors in the agranular insular cortex (AIC). This study was undertaken to determine if ifenprodil, a GluN2B preferring negative allosteric modulator, has a significant effect on social behaviors in PAE rats. Using a voluntary ethanol exposure paradigm, rat dams were allowed to drink a saccharin-sweetened solution of either 0% or 5% ethanol throughout gestation. Offspring at 6-8 months of age were implanted with cannulae into AIC. Animals were isolated for 24 h before ifenprodil or vehicle was infused into AIC, and after 15 min they were recorded in a social interaction chamber. Ifenprodil treatment altered aspects of wrestling, social investigatory behaviors, and ultrasonic vocalizations in rats exposed to ethanol during development that were not observed in control animals. These data indicate that GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors in AIC play a role in social behaviors and may underlie alterations in behavior and vocalizations observed in PAE animals.

"In the previous work, we have indicated that HMGB1, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is closely associated with the pathogenesis of psoriasis. To further clarify the role of HMGB1 in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, we investigated the direct function of HMGB1 application and HMGB1 blockade in imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriatic mouse model in this study. Mice were treated with imiquimod (IMQ) to induce psoriasis-like inflammation, and consecutively injected with recombinant HMGB1 or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) i.d. Abundant cytoplasmic expression of HMGB1 was observed in lesional skin from IMQ-treated skin. The injection of HMGB1 into the IMQ-treated skin further aggravated the psoriasis-like disease, enhanced the infiltration of CD3(+) T cells, myeloperoxidase(+) neutrophils and CD11c(+) dendritic cells, increased the number of T cells, and upregulated the mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, interferon (IFN)- and IL-17 compared with the PBS injection. Finally, by using anti-HMGB1 monoclonal antibody or HMGB1 inhibitor glycyrrhizin, we indicated that HMGB1 blockade reduced the number of T cells, suppressed the mRNA expression of IL-6, TNF-, IFN- and IL-17, and moderated clinical and histological evolvement in the IMQ-treated skin. Our data suggest that HMGB1 may act as a pro-inflammatory cytokine, and contribute to the development of IMQ-induced psoriasis-like inflammation. HMGB1 blockade may represent a new direction in the suppression of psoriasis.",21

"The work refers to an innovative system inspired by nature that mimics the thermoregulation system that exists in animals. This method, which is called Anti Bacteria Heat Exchanger (ABHE), is proposed to achieve continuous thermal disinfection of bacteria in hot water systems with high energy efficiency. In particular, this study aims to demonstrate the opportunity to gain energy by means of recovering heat over a plate heat exchanger. Firstly, the thermodynamics of the ABHE is clarified to define the ABHE specification. Secondly, a first prototype of an ABHE is built with a specific configuration based on simplicity regarding design and construction. Thirdly, an experimental test is carried out. Finally, a computer model is built to simulate the ABHE system and the experimental data is used to validate the model. The experimental results indicate that the performance of the ABHE system is strongly dependent on the flow rate, while the supplied temperature has less effect. Experimental and simulation data show a large potential for saving energy of this thermal disinfection method by recovering heat. To exemplify, when supplying water at a flow rate of 5 kg/min and at a temperature of 50 degrees C, the heat recovery is about 1.5 kW while the required pumping power is 1 W. This means that the pressure drop is very small compared to the energy recovered and consequently high saving in total cost is promising. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",88
"The introduction of a Feed-in-Tariff (FIT) support mechanism has spurred development of small-scale domestic renewable electricity generation throughout Great Britain (GB), however the spatial pattern of uptake has been uneven, suggesting that local, as well as between neighbourhood, factors may be at important. As well as confirming that local socio-economic factors, including wealth, housing type and population density are found to be important in explaining uptake of this policy, local ""green"" attitudes measured in three different ways are shown not to be important. Existing local technical expertise, proxied for using data on small-scale renewable electricity devices in each area prior to the introduction of FIT, is an important factor in explaining subsequent adoption. Critically, we also find that there are spatial (i.e. between neighbourhood) processes explaining the uptake of these technologies. Taken together, our results suggest that, as currently designed, FIT policy may be regressive in income and could exacerbate spatial economic inequalities.",100
"The current investigation evaluated whether cognitive processes characteristic of the Social Information Processing model predicted parent-child aggression (PCA) risk independent of personal vulnerabilities and resiliencies. This study utilized a multimethod approach, including analog tasks, with a diverse sample of 203 primiparous expectant mothers and 151 of their partners. Factors considered in this study included PCA approval attitudes, empathy, reactivity, negative child attributions, compliance expectations, and knowledge of non-physical discipline alternatives; additionally, vulnerabilities included psychopathology symptoms, domestic violence victimization, and substance use, whereas resiliencies included perceived social support, partner relationship satisfaction, and coping efficacy. For both mothers and fathers, findings supported the role of greater approval of PCA attitudes, lower empathy, more overreactivity, more negative attributions, and higher compliance expectations in relation to elevated risk of PCA. Moreover, personal vulnerabilities and resiliencies related to PCA risk for mothers; however, fathers and mothers differed on the nature of these relationships with respect to vulnerabilities as well as aspects of empathy and PCA approval attitudes. Findings provide evidence for commonalities in many of the factors investigated between mothers and fathers with some notable distinctions. Results are discussed in terms of how findings could inform prevention programs.",76
"Objective: To quantify the prevalence of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) among medical students of King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences (KSAU-HS) and to observe the association between anxiety and IBS. Methods: This cross-sectional observational study conducted during academic year 2015-2016 has used two self-administered, pre-validated questionnaires: Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) and Rome III criteria. The sample size was 270, and proportional allocation was used to determine distribution of this sample across study population based on percentages of students in each academic year. Convenience sampling was used to select participants. Results: The overall prevalence of IBS was 21% (n=57), with a higher prevalence among females (26%, n=23) than males (19%, n=34). IBS was most and least prevalent among first-year students (14%, n=5) and fifth-year students (29%, n=21) respectively. Anxiety levels were normal, mild, moderate, and severe or extremely severe in 39% (n=105), 7% (n=19), 26% (n=70), and 27%. A significant association was found between gender & IBS and anxiety levels & IBS. Conclusion: The prevalence of IBS in this study was 21% and higher among females than males but were highest among fifth-year students for both genders. More than 50% of students had moderate or high levels of anxiety for both genders. The prevalence of IBS was highest among students of 5th fifth year. The study provides evidence that, as medical students of higher year of their under graduation were having higher level of anxiety which leads to IBS.",4
"In this paper a programmable input mode instrumentation amplifier (IA) utilising second generation, multiple output current conveyors and transmission gates is presented. Its main advantage is the ability to choose a voltage or current mode of inputs by setting the voltage of two configuration nodes. The presented IA is prepared as an integrated circuit block to be used alone or as a sub-block in a microcontroller or in a field programmable gate array (FPGA), which shall condition analogue signals to be next converted by an analogue-to-digital converter (ADC). IA is designed in AMS 0.35 mu m CMOS technology and the power supply is 3.3 V; the power consumption is approximately 9.1 mW. A linear input range in the voltage mode reaches +/- 1.68 V or +/- 250 mu A in current mode. A passband of the IA is above 11 MHz. The amplifier works in class A, so its current supply is almost constant and does not cause noise disturbing nearby working precision analogue circuits.",51
"Representation and reasoning about context information is a main research area in Ambient Intelligence (AmI). Context modeling in such applications is facing openness and heterogeneity. To tackle such problems, we argue that usage of semantic web technologies is a promising direction. We introduce CONSERT, an approach for context meta-modeling offering a consistent and uniform means for working with domain knowledge, as well as constraints and meta-properties thereof. We provide a formalization of the model and detail its innovative implementation using techniques from the semantic web community such as ontology modeling and SPARQL. A stepwise example of modeling a commonly encountered AmI scenario showcases the expressiveness of our approach. Finally, the architecture of the representation and reasoning engine for CONSERT is presented and evaluated in terms of performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",92
"Consumption of bread and the demands concerning its quality features, being one of them its appearance, have been experiencing rapid growth. Thus, the standardization of its production aiming to keep its quality, applying new methods. The objective of this research was to develop a method to optimize the bread-making processes based on the acceptability of its crust color. For this effect, bread was experimentally produced using a Box-Behnlcen experimental design with three factors (sugar-flour relation, Baking temperature and Baking time) and three answer variables (L*, a*, b* = parameters of CIELab color space); determination of color, by means of the acquisition, pre-processing, and analysis of images of bread samples until getting the color expressed in CIELab coordinates; an analysis of sensorial acceptance was made determining the L*, a*, and b* with the highest acceptance by consumers; finally, the optimization of the production process was made based on the L*, a*, and b* parameters, getting the optimal production parameters. The results show that by using the proposed method, it is possible to correlate the parameters of CIELab color space and the acceptance of the final consumer aiming to optimize bread making processes, it means getting bread with crust color of maximum acceptability.

"The availability of water through community based water harvesting structure has intensified agriculture and improved livelihood of the surveyed beneficiary households in the Shivalik foothills of India. Before the introduction of Makowal Type Water Harvesting System (before MTWHS), only 83.8% farmers in kharif and 79.7% during rabi season were growing crops but after its introduction (after MTWHS) the corresponding values improved to 100% and 97.3%, respectively, thus increasing cropping intensity from 145% to 189%. Introduction of MTWHS enabled farmers to take paddy and agro-forestry during Kharif, and vegetables and fodder during Rabi season. The increase in cultivated area due to MTWHS was to the tune of 46.1% in Kharif and 36.3% during Rabi, while increase in crop productivity ranged from 55.1% to 111.3% in kharif and 8.6 to 132.0% in Rabi season. Better availability of irrigation changed varietal spectrum in favour of hybrids and high yielding varieties and farmers started adopting improved agronomic practices targeting better input-use efficiency. The MTWHS produced positive impact on the on-farm (crops, dairy and agro-forestry) sources of income and reduced the relative dependence on off-farm activities (labour, community forest area, etc.) for earnings. This system has brought drinking water very close to hutments of rural women thus reducing their drudgery and saving time. In general, rainwater harvesting from forest watersheds has resulted in quantum jumps in crop and milk production and acted as a catalyst to tie up the economic interest of communities, along with forest protection.",95
"A type of pneumatic artificial muscle damping seat used in crawler construction vehicle is introduced. When pneumatic artificial muscle works, nonlinear problem happens. This often makes its working performance become worse. Therefore, a self-tuning fuzzy PID controller is used for pneumatic artificial muscle damping seat to decrease this influence. A simplified three degrees of freedom mathematical model of seat-vehicle body-crawler chassis is established. The vibration damping characteristics of the pneumatic artificial muscle seat are obtained using Matlab/Simulink toolbox. Under four different working conditions of crawler construction vehicle, vertical accelerations and displacements are compared between the new pneumatic artificial muscle damping seat and traditional seat. The simulation results show that the pneumatic artificial muscle seat could get better damping properties. To verify the analytical model, experiments were performed on C and G roads. The simulation results show reasonably good agreements with the experimental data. These research results could provide references for further development of pneumatic artificial muscle-type damping seat.",59
"Background: The impact of presumed consent on donation rates has been widely debated. In June 2013 Greece adopted a 'soft' presumed consent law for organ and tissue donation, where relatives' approval is sought prior to organ removal. Aims: To report on the knowledge, attitudes and concerns of undergraduate students, enrolled in three health science disciplines, in regards to organ donation and presumed consent. Methods: Undergraduate junior and senior health science students [medical (MS), nursing (NS) and medical laboratory students (MLS)] were recruited from higher education settings in Thessaly, Greece. Dichotomous questions, previously used, were adopted to assess knowledge, attitudes and concerns towards organ donation, together with questions regarding the recent presumed consent legislation. Results: Three hundred seventy-one out of 510 students participated in the study (response rate: 72.7%). Only 3.6% of NS, 8.7% of MS and 3.2% of MLS carried a donor card. Although over 78% in all groups knew that it was possible to leave kidneys for transplant after death, only 10% to 39% considered themselves well-informed. NS were more likely to consider opting-out (21.5%), followed by MLS (17.9%) and MS (10.9%). Respondents were more likely to refuse organ removal upon death when expressing one of the following views: a) opposing a system making it lawful to take kidneys from an adult who has just died, unless forbidden while alive [Odds ratio (OR) 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 2.96 (1.48-5.93), p=0.002], b) worrying about their kidneys being removed after death [OR, 95% CI: 3.37 (1.75-6.49), p=<0.001] and c) believing that an intact body was needed after death [OR, 95% CI: 4.23 (2.15-8.31), p<0.001]. Conclusion: Health science students, soon to become healthcare professionals, demonstrated limited awareness in regards to the newly reformed organ donation system. Identified knowledge deficits and concerns could have far-reaching implications in terms of conveying a clear message and shaping the public's stand. The feasibility and effectiveness of a joint inter-professional curriculum on organ and tissue donation issues across all three health science disciplines, addressing common themes and concerns deserves further study.",25
"Insight refers to a situation in which a problem solver immediately changes his understanding of a problem situation. This representational change can either be triggered by external stimuli, like a hint or the solution itself, or by internal solution attempts. In the present paper, the differences and similarities between these two phenomena, namely ""extrinsic"" and ""intrinsic"" insight, are examined. To this end, electroencephalogram (EEG) is recorded while subjects either recognize or generate solutions to German verbal compound remote associate problems (CRA). Based on previous studies, we compare the alpha power prior to insightful solution recognition with the alpha power prior to insightful solution generation. Results show that intrinsic insights are preceded by an increase in alpha power at right parietal electrodes, while extrinsic insights are preceded by a respective decrease. These results can be interpreted in two ways. In consistency with other studies, the increase in alpha power before intrinsic insights can be interpreted as an increased internal focus of attention. Accordingly, the decrease in alpha power before extrinsic insights may be associated with a more externally oriented focus of attention. Alternatively, the increase in alpha power prior to intrinsic insights can be interpreted as an active inhibition of solution-related information, while the alpha power decrease prior to extrinsic insights may reflect its activation. Regardless of the interpretation, the results provide strong evidence that extrinsic and intrinsic insight differ on the behavioral as well as the neurophysiological level.",81

Even at 5 FPS, the vehicle is capable of navigating structured and unstructured roads at slow speed.",35
"We report on the 1st experimental elicitation of nonbelieved memories for childhood events in adults (Study 1) and children (Study 2) using a modified false memory implantation paradigm. Participants received true (trip to a theme park) and false (hot air balloon ride) narratives and recalled these events during 2 interviews. After debriefing, 13% of adults and 15% of children reported nonbelieved memories. While phenomenal ratings were higher for true than for nonbelieved memories immediately after the debriefing, after a month nonbelieved memories behaved as true memories. Also following debriefing, 23% of adults and 15% of children retracted their false memory claims. Prior to debriefing, participants with nonbelieved memories were most likely to indicate remembering the event, whereas participants with false memories who retracted their claim were most likely to endorse believing but not remembering the event. This research suggests that debriefings in previous false memory studies can lead to the development of nonbelieved memories. Additional findings regarding the correspondence between subjective belief, subjective memory, and objective memory judgments prior to and following debriefing are discussed.",78
"In relation to child abuse, child neglect has been understudied even though it is more common and causes at least as much harm. While child maltreatment (in a single category) has been linked to substance use disorders (SUD), and while child abuse alone (without neglect) has been linked to SUD, it remains unclear whether differences exist in the link between SUD and child abuse alone (without neglect) versus SUD and child neglect alone (without abuse). Utilising the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being II (NSCAW II, 2014): Wave I - 2008-09; Wave II - 18months later: N=5872), we used logistic regression to longitudinally assess whether past-year abuse versus past-year neglect in Wave I are equally influential in predicting newly diagnosed substance dependence in Wave II (among youth without SUD in Wave I). After adjusting for several factors, we found that past-year child neglect in Wave I was a significant predictor of newly diagnosed substance dependence in Wave II among youth who did not have SUD in Wave I. Other forms of youth maltreatment were unrelated. The findings suggest that child welfare and substance abuse professionals could pay special attention to youth with past-year neglect in order to help prevent the emergence of new substance dependence disorders.

"This article explores occasions when professionals in law enforcement and medicine find themselves trapped amidst the paradoxical demands of diagnostic/investigative practice. By juxtaposing research into the experiences of police officers charged with interviewing children who are the alleged victims of sexual abuse, and clinicians tasked with diagnosing and managing contested cases of thyroid disease, the paper develops an understanding of such practice paradoxes as occasions of stalled transition, or liminal hotspots. Drawing on a process theoretical understanding of liminality, the analysis explores the personal, experiential, and affective efficacy of the epistemological framework that both practices share. While liminal hotspots denote paradox stalemates, the paper argues that they are also responsible for recurrent instants of temporary affective unsettledness, and as such can provoke novel thinking and agency towards innovation in practice areas notoriously resistant to change and improvement. Systematizing this property could turn them into resources for change.",133
"Aim: This study investigated whether allergies among schoolchildren increased in Sweden between 1979 and 2007 and whether the geographical differences observed in previous studies remained. Methods: We collected questionnaire data on asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC) and eczema in children aged seven to eight years from Molndal, Gothenburg, in south-western Sweden and Kiruna in northern Sweden in 1979 (n = 4682), 1991 (n = 2481) and 2007 (n = 1029). The same regions and questions were used in all three studies, and extra questions on food allergy or intolerance were added in 2007. Results: In 1979, 1991 and 2007, the total prevalence of asthma was 2.5%, 5.7% and 7.1%, ARC was 5.5%, 8.1% and 11.1% and eczema was 7.1%, 18.3% and 19.7%, respectively. Asthma prevalence remained higher in Kiruna, but no significant regional differences were seen for ARC and eczema. Almost 20% reported a history of food allergy or intolerance, with a higher prevalence in Kiruna. The allergy risk was reduced if both parents were born outside Sweden. Conclusion: The prevalence of ARC continued to increase between 1991 and 2007, but increases in asthma and eczema started to level off in 1991. Some geographical differences remained, but total allergy rates were similar in Kiruna and Molndal in 2007.",105
"Canine dirofilarioses are mosquito-borne zoonotic diseases with a continuous expansion of their geographical distribution, as a consequence of different climatic and ecological factors. Dirofilaria immitis, the aetiological agent of heartworm disease, has gained a major veterinary interest, mainly due to its severe clinical implication. In the last decades, D. repens, despite of being regarded as a less pathogenic species, regained attention due to its recognized zoonotic potential. Romania has been traditionally regarded as a non-endemic country, but recent epidemiological surveys are highlighting the presence of both D. repens and D. immitis. The present case report describes the clinical and pathological features of a natural co-infection with D. repens and D. immitis in 5 year old male Boxer from north-western Romania. Based on clinical and laboratory investigations, a diagnosis of kidney failure and chronical cystitis was established. The parasites were identified by morphology and confirmed by PCR and sequencing. To the best of our knowledge this is the first worldwide report of the ectopic presence of D. repens adults in the pelvic cavity and mesentery by natural infection and first report of the ocular localization of this parasite for Romania. The clinical and paraclinical findings suggest the implication of D. repens microfilariae in the aetiology of histopathological lesions. Further investigations are needed in order to establish the actual pathogenic potential of D. repens, a frequently neglected parasite. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",80
"Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation overlay achievement and trophy systems onto their video games. Though these meta-game reward systems are growing in popularity, little research has examined whether players notice, use, or seek out these systems. In this study, game players participated in focus groups to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of meta-game reward systems. Participants described the value of meta-game reward systems in promoting different ways to play games, giving positive feedback about game play, and boosting self-esteem and online and offline social status. Participants discussed completionists, or garners that want to earn all of the badges associated with the meta-game. Though self-determination theory and its subtheory cognitive evaluation theory suggest that extrinsic rewards might harm players' intrinsic motivation, our findings suggest players may see these systems as intrinsically motivating in this context. The implications of rewards systems for motivation, video game habits, and internet gaming disorder are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",104

"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, disseminated inflammation of the central nervous system which is thought to be driven by autoimmune T cells. Genetic association studies in multiple sclerosis and a large number of studies in the animal model of the disease support a role for effector/memory T helper cells. However, the mechanisms underlying relapses, remission and chronic progression in multiple sclerosis or the animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, are not clear. In particular, there is only scarce information on the role of central nervous system-invading naive T helper cells in these processes. By applying two-photon laser scanning microscopy we could show in vivo that antigen unexperienced T helper cells migrated into the deep parenchyma of the inflamed central nervous system in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, independent of their antigen specificity. Using flow cytometric analyses of central nervous system-derived lymphocytes we found that only antigen-specific, formerly naive T helper cells became activated during inflammation of the central nervous system encountering their corresponding antigen.",11
"Purinergic signaling maintains local tissue homeostasis in blood vessels via the regulation of vascular tone, blood platelet aggregation, cell proliferation, and differentiation as well as inflammatory responses. Extracellular purines are important signaling molecules in the vasculature, and both purine-hydrolysing as well as -phosphorylating enzymes are considered to selectively govern extracellular nucleotide/nucleoside metabolism. Recent studies have provided some evidence for the existence of these enzymes in a soluble form in human blood and their secretion into the extracellular space under physiological and pathological conditions. However, the comprehensive analysis of endothelium-derived enzymes involved in purine metabolic pathways has received no attention so far. In the presented study, in vitro cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) are shown to be an abundant source of exo-nucleotidases comprising 5-nucleotidase (exo-5-NT), and nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (exo-NTPDase) as well as phosphotransferases, represented by nucleoside diphosphate kinase (exo-NDPK) and adenylate kinase (exo-AK). An attempt is also made to demonstrate that, in contrast to the metabolic pattern determined on the endothelial cell surface, exo-phosphorylating activities markedly predominate over exo-hydrolytic ones. We present for the first time the expression profiles of genes encoding isoenzymes belonging to distinct nucleotide kinase and nucleotidase families. The genes encoding NDPK1, NDPK2, AK1, and AK2 phosphotransferases have been shown to be expressed at the highest level in HUVEC cells. The data indicate the coexistence of secreted and cell-associated factors of endothelial origin mediating ATP-consuming and ATP-generating pathways with the predominance of exo-phosphotransferases activity. The described enzymes contribute to the regulation of purinergic signal duration and extent in the venous vasculature. J. Cell. Biochem. 118: 1341-1348, 2017. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",80
"The objective of this study was to measure the effect of selection for tolerance on the severity of the Aleutian disease (AD) lesions in mink. Sensitivity and specificity of antibody detection in the blood by counter-immunoelectrophoresis (CIEP) relative to the presence of Aleutian mink disease virus (AMDV) in the spleen by PCR in naturally infected farmed mink were also estimated. Carcasses of 680 sero-positive (CIEP-P) black mink from 28 farms in Nova Scotia, Canada, and from 132 sero-negative (CIEP-N) mink from 14 of these farms were collected at pelting time. A total of 116 of the CIEP-P mink were from three farms where animals have been selected for tolerating AD for almost 20 years. The severity of the AD lesions was assessed by histopathological examination of kidneys, lungs, heart, brain and liver on a scale of 0 to 4. Sensitivity and specificity of CIEP relative to PCR were 0.97 and 0.85, respectively, and 16.5% of CIEP-N mink were PCR positive, which could be one of the reasons for the failure of virus eradication by CIEP in Canada. The CIEP-N and tolerant CIEP-P animals had 9.39 and 6.23 greater odds of showing lower lesion severity, respectively, than the CIEP-P animals (P < 0.01). The CIEP-N mink had a slightly higher chance (P = 0.07) of showing lower lesion severity (odds ratio 1.51) compared with tolerant CIEPP mink. The results suggested that tolerant mink had significantly reduced severity of AD lesions despite having anti-viral antibodies and carrying the virus. (C) 2017 The Authors.

"A simple mathematical model for predicting the crushing stress of composite materials was derived and presented in this article. The present knowledge of fracture mechanics and strength of materials are used as the basis for the model. The fracture mechanics part of the analysis was based on energy release rate approach; the energy release rate, G, of the proposed model was determined by this approach. This energy release rate was based on the Mode I (opening or tensile mode) failure. As for the strength of materials part analysis, buckling theory was used to determine the critical load of the fiber beams. These two engineering concepts were combined to form the equation for the proposed model. The derived equation is a function of the materials properties, geometric, and physical parameters of the composite materials. The calculated stresses from the derived equation were compared with experimental data from technical and research articles. Good agreements shown in the results are encouraging and recommendations for future analysis with different modes of failure were also presented. This article enables engineering designers to predict crushing stress in composite materials with confidence and makes their work more efficient and reliable.",91
"Excessive mechanical loads induce chondrocyte apoptosis and irreversible cartilage degeneration, but the underlying molecular mechanism is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway in hydrostatic pressure (HP)-induced apoptosis in rat mandibular condylar chondrocytes. Chondrocytes were isolated from rat mandibular condylar cartilage and subjected to HP. Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 and flow cytometry assay. Expression of ER stress-associated molecules was detected by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analysis. In addition, expression of apoptosis-related proteins (bax, bcl-2, and cleaved-caspase-3) was assessed by western blot. To explore ER stress function, chondrocytes were pretreated with salubrinal before exposure to HP. Expression of type II collagen, aggrecan, MMP13, and ADAMTS-5 was evaluated by real-time PCR. The results indicated that HP reduced cell viability in a magnitude-and time-dependent manner. HP-induced activation of ER stress pathway by increasing expression of GRP78, CHOP, caspase-12, PERK, and peIF2 alpha in chondrocytes. Moreover, the expression of bax and cleaved-caspase-3 was increased, while the expression of bcl-2 was decreased in response to HP as the stress time prolonged. In addition, salubrinal suppressed HP-induced apoptosis, upregulated type II collagen and aggrecan mRNA expression, and downregulated MMP-13 and ADAMTS-5 mRNA expression in response to HP. These results demonstrate that HP induces apoptosis in mandibular condylar chondrocytes through ER stress-mediated apoptotic pathway. Suppression of ER stress by salubrinal prevents chondrocytes from undergoing apoptosis and matrix degradation induced by HP.",15
"This exploratory study provides insights into everyday realities, concerns, and cultural perspectives of Latinas undergoing chemotherapy, and elicits information on stress management and information needs. Informed by a community-based participatory research approach using qualitative methods, we conducted ten interviews with providers, and two focus groups (n = 13) and 20 in-depth interviews with Latinas recently diagnosed with breast cancer. Providers and Latina patients acknowledged multiple physical and emotional stressors associated with cancer treatment, viewed a positive aspect of the cancer experience to include connection with God and enhanced spirituality, saw family as a motivating factor for recovery, and expressed a need to draw on existing coping strategies. Findings show considerable overlap between providers and Latina cancer patients' perceptions of stressors during chemotherapy. However, a few notable differences in perceptions of stress management needs during this treatment period emerged. While Latina cancer patients mentioned similar social/structural stressors (e.g., economic problems, lack of information) they tended to emphasize more of the interpersonal stressors related to family communication and relationships (e.g., providing and caring for family, distance from family), and intrapersonal stressors such as fear, changes in physical appearance, and side effects of chemotherapy. Our study illustrates the importance of including multiple perspectives. The information gained by including both providers and patient perspectives yielded a more complete understanding of the stress management needs of Latinas undergoing chemotherapy. Findings suggest that stress management educational interventions should aim to develop self-care skills, be culturally relevant and language-specific, and build upon stress-reducing strategies Latinas may already employ.",29
"Alterations in motor functions are well-characterized features observed in humans and experimental animals with thyroid hormone dysfunctions during development. We have previously suggested the implication of the endocannabinoid system in the hyperlocomotor phenotype observed in developmentally induced hypothyroidism in rats. In this work we have further analyzed the implication of endocannabinoids in the effect of hypothyroidism on locomotor activity. To this end, we evaluated the locomotor activity in adult mice lacking the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R(-/-) and in their wild type littermates (CB1R(+/+)), whose hypothyroidism was induced in day 12 of gestation and maintained during the experimental period. Our results show that hypothyroidism induced a hyperlocomotor phenotype only in CB1R(+/+), but not in CB1R(-/-) mice. In contrast with our previous results in rats, the expression of CB1R in striatum and the motor response to the cannabinoid agonist HU210 was unaltered in hypo thyroid CB1R(+/+) mice suggesting that the cannabinoid system is not altered by hypothyroidism. Also, no effect of HU210 was observed in locomotion of CB1R(-/-) mice. Finally, since the dopaminergic system plays a major role in the control of locomotor activity we studied its function in hypothyroid wild type and knockout animals. Our results show no alteration in the behavioral response induced by the dopamine D1 receptor agonist SKF38393. However we observed a decreased response to the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol only in hypothyroid CB1R(+/+) mice, which might indicate potential alterations in D2R signaling in these animals. In conclusion, our data suggest that the cannabinoid system is necessary for the induction of hyperlocomotor phenotype in mice with developmentally induced hypothyroidism. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Objectives: To compare a standard sequential 2D Planning Method (2D-PM) with a 3D offline Planning Method (3D-PM) based on 3D contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) in children with congenital heart disease (CHD). Design: In 14 children with complex CHD (mean: 2.6 years, range: 3 months to 7.6 years), axial and coronal cuts were obtained with single slice spin echo sequences to get the final double oblique longitudinal cut of the targeted anatomical structure (2D-PM, n = 31). On a separate workstation, similar maximal intensity projection (MIP) images were generated offline from a 3D CE-MRA. MIP images were localizers for repeated targeted imaging using the previous spin echo sequence (3D-PM). Finally, image coverage, spatial orientation and acquisition time were compared for 2D-PM and 3D-PM. Main outcome measures: 2D-PM and 3D-PM images were similar: both perfectly covered the selected anatomic regions and no spatial differences were found (p>0.05). The mean time for creation of the final imaging plane was 241 +/- 31 s (2D-PM) compared to 71 +/- 18 s (3D-PM) (p<0.05). Conclusions: 3D-PM shows similar results compared to 2D-PM, but allows faster and offline planning thereby reducing the scan time significantly. As newly developed high-resolution 3D datasets can also be used further improvement of this technology is expected.",129
"This study compared dissociations between mental representations of current, ideal and normal body sizes (i.e., Current BS, Ideal BS and Normal BS) for women with anorexia nervosa (AN group, n = 56) and healthy women (control group, n = 56). Along the lines of the single channel model of Cornelissen et al. (2013), the discrepancy between Current BS and BMI for both groups was adequately described along a common linear continuum of Current BS (mis)perception. Body size mental representations were ranked similarly (Ideal BS < Current BS < Normal BS) in each group. Whilst the over-estimation of Current BS was much greater among the AN group than the control group, body dissatisfaction was better explained by Current BS for the AN group and by BMI for the control group. Dissociation between Current BS and participants' BMI appears to be a key element when seeking to understand AN. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",67
"The photovoltaic energy conversion is a thermodynamic system which converts the solar energy to the electrical and thermal energy. In this paper, a novel thermodynamic model of photovoltaic energy conversion system has been proposed on the basis of the first and second law of thermodynamics including entropy generation, optical, thermal, spectral and fill factor losses. Based on the irreversibilities, the proposed model has been classified into four cases i.e. reversible, endoreversible, exoreversible and irreversible systems, for which, the expressions of energetic and exergetic efficiencies have been derived. The upper limit efficiency of an ideal photovoltaic module placed in an irreversible environment, i.e. endoreversible system, is determined to be 82.8%. The effect of wind speed and module temperature on the energetic and exergetic efficiencies, thermodynamic losses and irreversibilities has also been presented. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"Research shows that anxiety may relate to any or all of the following: goal conflict resolution; distraction, and the automatic detection of threat-related stimuli. To investigate these relationships we used a modified Stroop task where fearful and happy emotional target faces are overlaid with either emotionally neutral, emotionally congruent or emotionally incongruent distracting words. A trait anxiety related speed-accuracy trade-off seemed to primarily reduce accuracy during incongruent trials with target fearful faces overlaid with the emotionally conflicting word happy. We offer an explanation of this effect based upon theories of how positive stimuli and threat-related stimuli differentially affect information processing. Future studies should seek to verify how the anxiety related speed-accuracy trade-off mechanism is activated, and elucidate how and when positive stimuli affect anxiety more than threat-related stimuli do.

"The known functions of type II thioesterases (TEIIs) in type I polyketide synthases (PKSs) include selecting of starter acyl units, removal of aberrant extender acyl units, releasing of final products, and dehydration of polyketide intermediates. In this study, we characterized two TEIIs (ScnI and PKSIaTEII) from Streptomyces chattanoogensis L10. Deletion of scnI in S. chattanoogensis L10 decreased the natamycin production by about 43%. Both ScnI and PKSIaTEII could remove acyl units from the acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) involved in the natamycin biosynthesis. Our results show that the TEII could play important roles in both the initiation step and the elongation steps of a polyketide biosynthesis; the intracellular TEIIs involved in different biosynthetic pathways could complement each other.

This paper proposes a protection method for single line-to-ground (SLG) faults in an ungrounded offshore wind farm with fully-rated converter-based wind turbines. The proposed method uses the unsynchronized current phasors measured by unit protections installed at the connection point of the fully-rated converter (FRC)-based wind turbines (WTs). Each unit protection collects the unsynchronized current phasors from two adjacent nodes and synchronizes them by aligning the positive-sequence current to the same phase angle. The faulted section is identified by comparing the phase angles of the synchronized zero-sequence currents from adjacent nodes. Simulations of an ungrounded offshore wind farm with relay models were carried out using power system computer-aided design (PSCAD)/electromagnetic transients including direct current (EMTDC).,82
"Objective: We compared the dose distributions of postoperative plans with preoperative plans for 3D printing template-assisted radioactive seed implantations. Methods: A total of 14 patients with malignant tumors enrolled in the study. The dose parameters included D90, minimum peripheral dose, V100, V150, and V200. The statistical method was the paired t-test. Results: There was no significant difference in P values between the two groups for all parameters except for V100. Conclusions: The 3D printing guide template can provide good accuracy for radioactive seed implantation.",14
"The co-existence of Darier disease (DD) and acrokeratosis verruciformis of Hopf (AKV) has been noted for decades and the relationship between the 2 entities remains controversial. Although, it has been shown that both diseases are associated with mutations in ATPA2 gene, it is yet to be determined if they are the same disease, or separate but allelic, or interlinked in some other fashion. Herein, the authors report the case of a 13-year-old girl presenting with shiny flat-topped verruca plana-like papules, on the dorsal hands and feet and red-brown crusted papules on her forehead and along the sides of her neck. Histological evaluation of a wart-like lesion shows features of AKV, a verruca plana-like histopathology and focal acantholytic dyskeratosis. Forehead biopsy also demonstrated focal acantholytic dyskeratosis supporting the diagnosis of DD. Polymerase chain reaction for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA detected HPV-17, a human betapapillomavirus in the verruca plana-like papule. Cytoplasmic expression of the L1 capsid expression was seen in areas of hypergranulosis. The presence of productive betaPV infection in the setting of DD and AKV suggests a susceptibility to HPV infection.",37
"Reduced L-ascorbic acid can be oxidized by ascorbate peroxidase (APX) in ascorbate metabolism pathway. In present study, a mitochondrial APX (mitAPX) was cloned and suppressed by RNA interference in tomato via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The existence of the RNA interference T-DNA in transformed plants and their progenies were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction amplification and Southern blotting. Decreased mitAPX expression in homozygous transgenic lines was detected by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, accompanied by decreasing cytosolic APX activity by 0.4- to 0.8-fold of the untransformed control. The mitochondrial APX enzyme activity in RNAi lines decreased to 29-45% of the wild type plants. The down-regulated mitAPX expression and APX enzyme activity lead to 1.4- to 2.2-fold increase in ascorbic acid content in tomato fruits compared with wild-type control. The APX expression and APX enzyme activity were found to be correlated with increase in the amount of ascorbic acid in tomato fruits. This report demonstrates the modulation of ascorbic acid metabolic pathway by RNA interference method, and provides a feasible approach to improve ascorbic acid content in horticultural plants by suppressing genes related to ascorbic acid metabolism.

"Cannibalism, or intraspecific predation, can play a major role in changing individual fitness and population processes. In insects, cannibalism frequently occurs across life stages, with cannibals consuming a smaller or more vulnerable stage. Predation of adult insects on one another is considered to be uncommon. We investigated adult cannibalism in the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), which is an oligophagous herbivore specializing on plants in family Solanaceae, and an important agricultural pest. Under laboratory conditions, starvation and crowding encouraged teneral adults to feed upon each other, which reduced their weight loss during the period of starvation. However, pupae were attacked and consumed before adults. Injured beetles had a higher probability of being cannibalized than intact beetles. Males were more frequently attacked than females, but that appeared to be a function of their smaller size rather than other gender-specific traits. Cannibalizing eggs at a larval stage did not affect beetle propensity to cannibalize adults at an adult stage. When given a choice between conspecific adults and mealworms, the beetles preferred to eat conspecifics. Cannibalistic behavior, including adult cannibalism, could be important for population persistence in this species.",121
"With introducing demand response aggregator (DRA) in smart paradigm, small customers can actively participate in price and incentive-based demand response programs. This new matter can significantly affect many factors of power system such as transmission network security. Accordingly, it is notably useful to define an adjusted framework for transmission expansion planning in smart environment. A long-term market simulation is performed using a tri-level iterative framework to find the best expansion decisions for transmission company (TransCo) in a pool-based market. The TransCo's investment decisions are made by a merchant approach consistent with transmission network security and smart environment. The effects of smart environment on future network configuration, strategic bidding of generators in the market operation, and contingency analysis are considered during planning process. The effectiveness of proposed method is examined on the IEEE 24-bus system with one DRA, one TransCo, and two generation companies under the independent system operator's supervision.

"Rainwater harvesting can provide an alternative water source, which may demand little treatment, depending on the end use. Some starches have been used in water treatment as coagulant/flocculant/filtration aid, and might be applied as primary coagulant. Here, we show direct filtration with hydraulic rapid mixing, using 2-6 mg L-1 cationic corn starch as primary coagulant, considerably improves roof-harvested rainwater quality, achieving removal efficiencies of up to 71.7% of apparent colour, 78% of turbidity, 1.1 log-unit of total coliform, and 1.6 log-unit of Escherichia coli, meeting guidelines for turbidity, even for potable purposes. Cationic corn starch has proved to be a suitable primary coagulant when filtration is performed in a single-layer sand filter (coefficient of uniformity: 1.8, effective particle size: 0.52 mm), at hydraulic loading rate of 450 m day(-1). However, a disinfection unit is required to meet an absence of faecal coliform.",95
"In this paper, an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) method, which is based on standard particle swarm optimization (PSO) and a changing range genetic algorithm (GA), is proposed, and it is applied in the form-finding analysis of a suspension bridge installation. The new method has been integrated into the successive iteration method of the form-finding analysis, and it transfers the usual iterative process of form-finding analysis into a single objective optimization problem. The computation formulation and computer code of the IPSO have been developed and implemented, and benchmark examples are studied to test the performance of the IPSO method through numerical experiments. The results show that IPSO can be used as a viable solution methodology for the form-finding analysis in various initial, boundary, and complicated load conditions to overcome the limitations of the conventional Newton-Raphson (N-R) iterative method. Furthermore, compared with GA, PSO, and GA-PSO, IPSO has greater accuracy and efficiency. Finally, the method is applied in an actual form-finding analysis of a multitower suspension bridge (Yingwuzhou Yangtze River Bridge) to validate the practicality and feasibility of the IPSO-based method in engineering design. The case study indicates that IPSO provides superior convergent solutions for the analysis considered here when compared to the N-R method, and the computation time is affordable for large-scale engineering bridge construction design and analysis.",97
"In animals, self-grooming is an important component of their overall hygiene because it reduces the risk of disease and parasites. The European honey bee (Apis mellifera) exhibits hygienic behavior, which refers to the ability of the members of a colony to remove diseased or dead brood from the hive. Individual grooming behavior, however, is when a bee grooms itself to remove parasites. While both behaviors are critical for the mitigation of disease, hygienic behavior is overwhelmingly more studied because, unlike grooming behavior, it has a simple bioassay to measure its phenotype. Here, we develop a novel bioassay to expedite data collection of grooming behavior by testing different honey bee genotypes (stocks). Individual worker bees from different commercial stocks were coated in baking flour, placed in an observation arena, and digitally recorded to automatically measure grooming rates. The videos were analyzed in MATLAB, and an exponential function was fit to the pixel data to calculate individual grooming rates. While bees from the different commercial stocks were not significantly different in their grooming rates, the automation of grooming measurements may facilitate future research and stock selection for this important mechanism of social immunity.

"In our study we examined the role of microRNA-294 (miR-294) in bladder cancer and related mechanisms. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to determine the expression level of miR-294. Western blot was used to determine the expression of NRAS, mainly factors in the PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT pathways. Cell counting kit-8 assay, clonogenic assay, wound-healing assay, transwell and flow cytometry were used to explore, respectively, cell proliferation, survival, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of bladder cancer cell line T24. The expressions of miR-294 in bladder cancer cells including J82, HT1376, T24, and SW780 were significantly increased compared to those in human bladder epithelium cells (both HCV29 and SV-HUC-1). The proliferation rate, surviving fraction, migration, and invasion of T24 cells in miR-294 mimetic transfected group were significantly increased, while they were significantly decreased by miR-294 inhibitor transfection. Moreover, miR-294 suppression could increase the apoptotic rate of T24 cells. In addition, drug resistance of T24 cells to cisplatin was increased in miR-294 mimetic-treated group, while it was decreased by miR-294 inhibitor compared to empty control. Overexpression of miR-294 could upregulate NRAS expression in T24 cells and activate PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT pathways. We found that miR-294 expression was positively related with proliferation and motility of T24 cells. Moreover, miR-294 suppression could promote the sensitivity of T24 cells to cisplatin. We also found miR-294 could upregulate NRAS and activate the PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT pathways in T24 cells.",37
"Purpose of review In the last nine decades, large advances have been made toward the characterization of the pathogenic basis and clinical management of von Willebrand disease (VWD), the most prevalent inherited bleeding disorder. Pathological variations at the von Willebrand factor (VWF) locus present as a range of both quantitative and qualitative abnormalities that make up the complex clinical spectrum of VWD. This review describes the current understanding of the pathobiological basis of VWD. Recent findings The molecular basis of type 2 (qualitative abnormalities) and type 3 VWD (total quantitative deficiency) have been well characterized in recent decades. However, knowledge of type 1 VWD (partial quantitative deficiency) remains incomplete because of the allelic and locus heterogeneity of this trait, and is complicated by genetic variability at the VWF gene, interactions between the VWF gene and the environment, and the involvement of external modifying loci. Recent genome wide association studies and linkage analyses have sought to identify additional genes that modify the type 1 VWD phenotype. Summary Understanding the pathogenic basis of VWD will facilitate the development of novel treatment regimens for this disorder, and improve the ability to provide complementary molecular diagnostics for type 1 VWD.",30

Green building technologies in line with Islamic values and examples of sustainability promoting policies are analyzed and used to further develop design strategies. The findings include a theoretical model that proposes the essential design criteria for appropriate architecture for the Muslim world. This research is relevant for architects designing for Muslims, who have a duty to create housing appropriate for their particular needs and cultural context.",99
"Context: Several research efforts have been targeted to support architecture centric development and evolution of software for robotic systems for the last two decades. Objective: We aimed to systematically identify and classify the existing solutions, research progress and directions that influence architecture-driven modeling, development and evolution of robotic software. Research Method: We have used Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) method for identifying and analyzing 56 peer-reviewed papers. Our review has (i) taxonomically classified the existing research and (ii) systematically mapped the solutions, frameworks, notations and evaluation methods to highlight the role of software architecture in robotic systems. Results and Conclusions: We have identified eight themes that support architectural solutions to enable (i) operations, (ii) evolution and (iii) development specific activities of robotic software. The research in this area has progressed from object-oriented to component-based and now to service-driven robotics representing different architectural models that emerged overtime. An emerging solution is cloud robotics that exploits the foundations of service-driven architectures to support an interconnected web of robots. The results of this SMS facilitate knowledge transfer- benefiting researchers and practitioners- focused on exploiting software architecture to model, develop and evolve robotic systems.

"Objectives: This study aimed to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and tolerability of LBAL, a biosimilar of adalimumab, with the originator, Humira (R), in healthy volunteers.Methods: A randomized, double-blind, single-dose, two-arm, parallel-group study was conducted in 116 healthy subjects. They randomly received a single subcutaneous (SC) 40mg injection of LBAL or Humira. Blood samples were collected for PK and immunogenicity assessment. PK parameters were determined using the noncompartmental method, and primary endpoint parameters were compared using the point estimates and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the geometric mean ratios (GMRs). Tolerability was also evaluated.Results: The PK characteristics of the test and reference drugs were comparable. The GMR (90% CIs) for C-max and AUC(inf) of LBAL to Humira were 1.01 (0.92-1.11) and 0.96 (0.83-1.10), respectively, which were within the conventional bioequivalence criteria of 0.80-1.25. No significant differences occurred in the frequency of subjects with anti-adalimumab antibody-positive responses between both drugs. Tolerability profiles including adverse events were also comparable.Conclusion: The PK characteristics of the biosimilar LBAL and the originator Humira were similar. LBAL and Humira did not show significant differences in immunogenicity and both were well tolerated after a single SC injection.",23
"The authors examined the joint (interactive) roles of the Second Step curriculum (a validated social-emotional learning and bullying prevention program; Committee for Children, Seattle, WA) and parenting practices on students' behavioral and academic outcomes in Grades 5-8. Participants were 763 parents and their children from 22 schools (8 control and 14 treatment). A 2-level random coefficient model was conducted to assess the effect of parental monitoring on school outcomes, as well as the interaction between character development curriculum and parental monitoring. Results indicated that parental monitoring was a significant predictor of school behaviors and school grades. Furthermore, the Second Step curriculum moderated the relationship between parental monitoring and problem behaviors, prosocial behaviors, and grades at school. Specifically, in schools without the Second Step curriculum parental monitoring predicted higher school grades but had no impact on students' school behaviors. By contrast, in schools with the Second Step curriculum, parental monitoring predicted fewer problem behaviors as well as more prosocial behaviors. The study results highlight the joint influences of the family and the school in children's behavioral and academic trajectories. Results have implications for education and intervention, including improving the school climate, student behaviors, and learning or achievement.",18
"For indoor smart grids, the proper operation of building environmental systems is essential to energy efficiency, so automatic detection and classification of abnormal conditions are important. The application of computational intelligence tools to a building's environmental systems that include the building automation system (BAS) and heating ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) loads is used to develop automatic building diagnostic tools for health monitoring, fault detection, and diagnostics. A novel health monitoring system (HMS) for a variable air volume (VAV) unit is developed using fuzzy logic (FL) to detect abnormal operating conditions and to generate fault signatures for various fault types. Artificial neural network classification technique is applied to fault signatures to classify the fault type. The HMS is tested with simulated data and actual BAS data. The system created was demonstrated to recognize faults and to accurately classify the various fault signatures for test faults of interest.",99
"The objectives of the present study were to identify the relationship between coping style and PTG among survivors 8 years after the Wenchuan earthquake, using data from a cross-sectional survey. 1369 participants were recruited from two different sites in the areas that were severely affected by the earthquake. Bivariate correlation analysis and multivariate linear regression analysis were used to assess PTG and identify associated factors. The results indicated that both positive and negative coping style can develop to PTG among adult survivors 8 years later after Wenchuan earthquake. Positive coping style had a higher correlation with ""new possibilities"" (beta = 0.19, p < 0.001), ""personal strength"" (beta = 030, p < 0.001) ""appreciation of life"" (beta = 0.11, p < 0.001) than negative coping style, while negative coping style had a higher correlation with ""relating to others"" (beta = 0.25, p < 0.001) than positive coping style. In addition, the study found PTSD and PTG co-exist after the earthquake, while depression was a barrier factor during the process of developing PTG. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",69
"Objective: In psychotherapy clients' I don't know-responses (IDK-responses) to therapists' questions are typically considered to be non-cooperating behaviors. How therapists actually handle these behaviors remains unclear. This study therefore aims to assess client-therapist interactions following IDK-responses. Methods: Data were collected in a Dutch child and adolescent mental healthcare service by observing Dialectical Behavior Therapy aimed at adolescents with severe emotional distress. Eighteen individual psychotherapy sessions involving two therapists with six clients were video-recorded and transcribed. Stand-alone IDK-responses were selected (n = 77) and analyzed using conversation analysis. Results: Adolescents' IDK-responses led to varying actions of therapists. We identified five categories of continuations after IDK-responses: no IDK-related continuation; redoing of the question; proposing a candidate answer; employing therapy-specific techniques; and meta-talk on the problematic nature of the IDK-response. Conclusions: Therapists treat IDK-responses not just as non-cooperative behavior on the part of the client; IDK-responses are also used as a starting point to collaboratively enhance clients' insights in their own thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Practice implications: After IDK-responses therapists can use a variety of continuation strategies with varying therapeutic functions. These strategies can be embedded in training of therapists to deal with potentially non-cooperative behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",70
"Nearly all of the known populations of Scarce Fritillary, Euphydryas maturna (Linnaeus, 1758), are declining in Western and Central Europe. In order to identify the possible reasons for its vulnerability we surveyed the population genetics of this butterfly species using multi-locus genotype data. Females of our target species lay lots of eggs in one or two batches only and pre-hibernation caterpillars live and feed gregariously in a nest. As a consequence, a random unfavourable event can eliminate most offspring of a particular female resulting in a strong genetic drift effect combined with inbreeding. Thus, our hypothesis regarding the genetic composition of Scarce Fritillary populations suggests that: (1) there will be random fluctuations in allele frequencies from generation to generation; (2) populations should exhibit small effective sizes and a relatively high level of heterozygote deficiency, and; (3) the majority of the individuals in a population will be composed of the offspring of just a few females. In order to test these hypotheses, fine-scale genetic structure was studied in two subpopulations of a Hungarian Scarce Fritillary population for 4 consecutive years (generations) using enzyme polymorphism data. The results supported all of our assumptions. We detected random fluctuation in the frequency of several alleles, small effective population size and the index of heterozygote deficiency (F-IS) indicated a considerable level of inbreeding in most samples. Furthermore, average values of relatedness were also fairly high, and we were able to identify 17 putative sib families in total with the two subpopulations based on estimation of individual gametic phases. Thus, the present study suggests that intrinsic factors (e.g. specific life history) might increase the sensitivity of a species to various threatening factors (e.g. habitat loss or fragmentation) and result in the vulnerability of the given species.",34
"Epitranscriptome refers to any relevant changes in gene expression without changes in RNA sequences. Similar to epigenetic changes, the epitranscriptomic changes are in general mediated by post-transcriptional chemical modifications of RNA species. Recently, mRNA modifications, especially both N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and N1-methyladenosine (m1A), have received significant attention as proteins responsible for generating, removing or recognizing m6A modification have been identified. m6A in eukaryotic cells including human and mouse was initially identified in early 1970s. However, the function of the modification has not been intensively studied because of technical limitations. Recently, using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, several groups revealed transcriptome-wide distribution of m6A and its both in vitro and in vivo roles in biological processes such as metabolism and development.

In addition, an integrated landscape of m6A enrichments in both human and mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is presented using publically available datasets.",31
"The present paper shows an innovative multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) which is able to easily and quickly change its configuration. In order to satisfy this feature, the principal structure is made of an universal plate, combined with a circular ring, to create a rail guide able to host the arms, in a variable number from 3 to 8, and the legs. The arms are adjustable and contain all the avionic and motor drivers to connect the main structure with each electric motor. The unique arm design, defined as all-in-one, allows classical single rotor configurations, double rotor configurations and amphibious configurations including inflatable elements positioned at the bottom of the arms. The proposed multi-rotor system is inexpensive because of the few universal pieces needed to compose the platform which allows the creation of a kit. This modular kit allows to have a modular drone with different configurations. Such configurations are distinguished among them for the number of arms, number of legs, number of rotors and motors, and landing capability. Another innovation feature is the introduction of the 3D printing technology to produce all the structural elements. In this manner, all the pieces are designed to be produced via the Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) technology using desktop 3D printers. Therefore, an universal, dynamic and economic multi-rotor UAV has been developed.",53
"Software and software deliverables have high impact on all fields. Once software is deployed, it has to be maintained continuously, till it becomes obsolete. Various activities that come under maintenance include adaptive, corrective, and predictive maintenance. Even though software maintenance is not tagged as a core field in software engineering compared to other software-related activities, almost 70 % of time and resources are allotted for maintenance activities. According to the related work, very little research is going on in the field of maintenance and this article highlights the scope of maintenance-related research. Identifying the factors that directly and indirectly affect the maintenance activity will in turn make the estimation activities easy. Implementation of an effective software maintenance model will have a very high impact in the quality of software and thereby with customer satisfaction. This article aims to project an effective maintenance model which reduces cost of rework and improves customer satisfaction index.",123
"Objective: Episodic cluster headache is characterized by abnormalities in tyrosine metabolism (i.e. elevated levels of dopamine, tyramine, octopamine and synephrine and low levels of noradrenalin in plasma and platelets.) It is unknown, however, if such biochemical anomalies are present and/or constitute a predisposing factor in chronic cluster headache. To test this hypothesis, we measured the levels of dopamine and noradrenaline together with those of elusive amines, such as tyramine, octopamine and synephrine, in plasma of chronic cluster patients and control individuals. Methods: Plasma levels of dopamine, noradrenaline and trace amines, including tyramine, octopamine and synephrine, were measured in a group of 23 chronic cluster headache patients (10 chronic cluster ab initio and 13 transformed from episodic cluster), and 16 control participants. Results: The plasma levels of dopamine, noradrenaline and tyramine were several times higher in chronic cluster headache patients compared with controls. The levels of octopamine and synephrine were significantly lower in plasma of these patients with respect to control individuals. Conclusions: These results suggest that anomalies in tyrosine metabolism play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic cluster headache and constitute a predisposing factor for the transformation of the episodic into a chronic form of this primary headache.",10
"Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of relaxation techniques on the stress/anxiety of parents with hospitalised premature infants, three months following discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit. Study design: A randomised controlled trial was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit of a tertiary maternity hospital including 59 parents, who were randomised into two groups: 31 in the intervention group and 28 in the control group. Parents in the intervention group practiced three different relaxation techniques, in addition to undergoing the same information-based training courses as did the parents of the control group. Data collection: Data were collected 10-15 days post delivery and three months post discharge. The assessment measures included the Perceived Stress Scale, the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory 1 and 2 and salivary cortisol levels. Results: The psychometric assessment at baseline was comparable between the two groups. The intervention group showed a significant reduction in trait anxiety (p = 0.02) compared with the control group three months post discharge. The perceived stress decreased in both groups (p = 0.699). No difference in salivary cortisol levels was detected. The multivariate analysis revealed that higher initial stress levels (p < 0.001) and university/college education (p = 0.003) were associated with higher parental stress, whereas moderate-to-high income satisfaction was associated with lower parental stress (p = 0.003). Conclusion: Further long-term follow-up of families with a neonatal intensive care unit experience could assess more delayed effects of stress management by relaxation techniques.

"Galvanized steel is widely used in transportation and industry. However, the corrosion performance of these products is highly affected while exposed to chloride-containing environments. One alternative is Al-rich metal coatings which are known to notably improve the corrosion protection of the steel substrate by the enhanced barrier properties provided by Al. Although hot dip aluminum-based coatings on steel are nowadays used for many applications, little is known about the electrochemical behaviour of these coatings. This work studies the corrosion behaviour of Al-containing metal coated steel. Odd random phase multisine electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (ORP-EIS) is used for monitoring the corrosion evolution under continuous immersion in a NaCl solution. This technique allows a rapid screening of corrosion processes due to the reduced measurement time with respect to conventional single sine techniques. Extra information concerning linearity, stationarity and noise level is also supplied and can be valuable for further data quality evaluation and fitting. Different equivalent electrical circuits are proposed and their validity is discussed, not only based on physical phenomena but also taking the quality of the obtained data and the statistical evaluation of the fittings into account.

"Objective:Use of high-dose cyclophosphamide without hematopoietic stem cell transplant to treat severe aplastic anemia (SAA) has been controversial due to concern for increased infectious toxicity as compared with antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine A. As children often tolerate dose-intensive therapy better than adults, we sought to perform a detailed retrospective analysis of both treatment response and toxicity in 28 patients younger than 22 years of age treated with 29 courses of high-dose cyclophosphamide as the sole form of immunosuppression.Study Design:Children and adolescents with SAA who lacked an human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling donor were treated with cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg/d for 4 consecutive days then received daily granulocyte colony stimulating factor until neutrophil recovery, transfusion support, and antimicrobial prophylaxis.Results:Overall survival was 85%, with hematologic response of 79% and complete response of 66%. Cumulative incidences of bacterial infection (86%) and fungal infection (62%) were high but deaths due to infection were rare, as were clonal evolution (1/28), clinically relevant paroxysmal nocturnal (1/28), and relapse (2/28).Conclusions:Response rates and survival following high-dose cyclophosphamide in pediatric patients with SAA exceed those seen in adults and compare favorably to antithymocyte globulin/cyclosporine A with manageable infectious toxicity.",126
"Background: In acupuncture practice, the most important step is to confirm the location of a sensitized acupoint which reflects a diagnosis and can be stimulated with a specialized needle to treat the disease. Abnormal symptoms such as hyperalgesia or allodynia at the sensitized acupoints in patients with visceral disorders are considered to be in relation with referred pain and neurogenic inflammation. Yet, limited study has investigated the cutaneous neurochemical changes of the sensitized acuponits. Methods: The resent study developed an animal model of gastric mucosal injury (GMI) by HCl administered into the stomach of the rats. Evans Blue (EB) dye was applied by injection of tail vein after mucosal damage to observe the neurogenic plasma extravasation dots in the skin of the rats. The EB dots extravagated in the skin were compared with locations of acupoints. Immnohistochemistry analysis was used to detect the expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)- or substance P (SP)-labeled nerve fibers, histamine (HA)-, serotonin (5-HT)-, and tryptase-labeled cells in EB dots. Images were recorded and analyzed by Confocal imaging system and Olympus Image Processing Software. Results: The results showed that GMI resulted in neurogenic plasma extravasation in the skin of the acupoints over the back and abdomen, which mostly occurred in the T9-11 dermatomere. The EB extravasation dots appeared after GMI and disappeared gradually during the natural self-recovery of the gastric mucosa. More SP and CGRP positive nerve fibers were distributed in EB dots than that in regions beside EB dots and in the control, mostly distributed in the nerve fibers around both the vessels and root of hair follicle. Mast cells also aggregated and degranulated to release algogenic substances of 5-HT and HA around the vessels in areas of the EB dots. Conclusions: Our results indicates that the mechanism of EB extravasation in the skin of the acupoints induced by GMI are closely related to neurogenic inflammation, and that the high expression of local allergic substances and nociceptive neuropeptides in the local skin including SP, CGRP, HA, 5-HT, and mast cell tryptase may be the underlying mechanism of the acupoint sensitization.",90
"Background: Default mode network (DMN) is vulnerable to the effects of APOE genotype. Given the reduced brain volumes and APOE epsilon 4-related brain changes in elderly carriers, it is less known that whether these changes would influence the functional connectivity and to what extent. This study aimed to examine the functional connectivity within DMN, and its diagnostic value with age-related morphometric alterations considered. Methods: Whole brain and seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis were conducted in cognitively normal APOE epsilon 4 carriers and matched non-carriers (N=38). The absolute values of mean correlation coefficients (z-values) were used as a measure of functional connectivity strength (FCS) between DMN subregions, which were also used to estimate their diagnostic value by receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: APOE epsilon 4 carriers demonstrated decreased interhemispheric FCS, particularly between right hippocampal formation (R.HF) and left inferior parietal lobular (L.IPL) (t=3.487, p<0.001). ROC analysis showed that the FCS of R.HF and L.IPL could differentiate APOE epsilon 4 carriers from healthy counterparts (AUC value=0.734, p=0.025). Moreover, after adjusting the impact of morphometry, the differentiated value of FCS of R.HF and L.IPL was markedly improved (AUC value=0.828, p=0.002). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that APOE epsilon 4 allele affects the functional connectivity within posterior DMN, particularly the atrophy-corrected interhemispheric FCS before the clinical expression of neurodegenerative disease.",106
"The reduction of crown rot disease observed in UVC-irradiated banana fruit, 'Berangan' was associated with activation of the defense response mechanisms, increased peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase activities as well as accumulation of lignin and phenolic compounds in its crown tissue, but not phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity. Transmission electron microscope micrographs revealed that 0.01 kJ m (2) UVC retarded the losses of cell compartments and disintegrations of fibril fraction in cell wall structure of the crown tissue. UVC treatment 24 h after fungal inoculation induced the accumulation of phenol-storing cells that could create an antimicrobial environment in the host tissue for combating the fungal colonization. Moreover, formation of cell wall lignification and heterogenous matrix of cell wall appositions at site of fungal penetration was clearly observed in UVC-irradiated crown tissue, which otherwise absent in the control crowns. These structures might be important physical barriers that were induced by the irradiation to prevent diffusions of toxin and enzyme from the crown rot-infecting fungi. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

"Training in ethics is fundamental in higher education among both faith-based and secular colleges and universities, regardless of one's academic major or field of study. Catholic colleges and universities have included moral philosophy, theology, and applied ethics in their undergraduate curricula for generations. The purpose of this investigation was to determine what, if anything, Jesuit college psychology departments are doing to educate psychology majors regarding ethical issues. A survey method was used to assess the psychology departments of all 28 Jesuits colleges and universities in the United States. A total of 21 of the 28 schools responded and completed the survey. Five schools (23%) reported that they offered a course specifically on ethics in psychology, and three (14%) additional schools offered related courses. Of the eight (38%) that offered ethics-related courses, only one required its majors to take it, and only if they were enrolled in the mental health or forensic psychology tracks. For two (10%) of the schools, the ethics in psychology course counted as a university core ethics requirement; for two others (10%), the class met an elective university ethics requirement for psychology majors.",125
"An analytical method for the determination of beta-hydroxyethoxyacetic acid (HEAA), the main urinary metabolite of 1,4-dioxane was developed and validated. The presented method involves liquid-liquid extraction of HEM from the urine samples, followed by silylation and subsequent analytical separation and detection using GC-MS. The method is characterized by its simple and fast sample preparation in combination with a robust chromatography. The use of isotope dilution analysis enables an efficient compensation of matrix related effects and analyte losses due to sample workup. The excellent reliability and reproducibility of the method is demonstrated by the good accuracy and precision data. Within-day precision and day-to-day precision ranged from 0.6 to 1.2% and 1.5 to 2.6%, respectively. The mean relative recovery of the method was found to be 98-101%. The LOD and LOQ of HEM were determined to be 0.2 mg/L and 0.6 mg/L, respectively. In summary, the presented analytical method is well suited to be used for routine biomonitoring of occupational exposure to 1,4-dioxane. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",32
"Chronic exposure to cocaine in vivo induces long-term synaptic plasticity associated with the brain's circuitry that underlies development of repetitive and automatic behaviors called habits. In fact, prolonged drug consumption results in aberrant expression of protein-coding genes and small regulatory RNAs, including miRNAs that are involved in synaptic plasticity and neuroadaptations. However, the mechanisms mediating cocaine use disorder are still not fully understood. The present study is designed to examine the expression of miR-124, miR-132, miR-134, and miR-212, as well as the levels of the Ago2, Pum2, and REST mRNAs and proteins implicated in their regulation. We applied rat cocaine self-administration (SA) and extinction training procedures with a yoked triad to assess the changes in the levels of four miRNAs and three protein-coding genes and corresponding proteins in the dorsal striatum. We demonstrated that elevated expression of mature miR-212 and miR-132 is long-lasting and persists in the drug-free period (till 10-day abstinence). Moreover, mRNA and protein of REST, a regulator of neuronal transcription, was raised selectively in cocaine self-administering rats and Ago2 transcript decreased after cocaine treatment. Unexpectedly, the expression level of Ago2 and Pum2 proteins changed only in the active cocaine-receiving animals. These results point out the important aspects of long-lasting alterations in microRNAs, genes, and protein expressions involved in the control of synaptic plasticity associated with reward and motivation learning related to cocaine addiction.",104
"Background: Difficulties in diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) motivate the search for new diagnostic tools, including laboratory tests. The aim of this study was to evaluate concentrations of the neutrophil (NEU) proteins leukocyte elastase (HLE-alpha 1AT), lactoferrin and calprotectin as potential biomarkers used in the diagnosis and assessment of clinical activity of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Material/Methods: The study included 27 patients with CD, 33 patients with UC and 20 healthy controls. Plasma concentrations of calprotectin, lactoferrin and HLE-alpha 1AT were measured using ELISA. Results: In patients with CD higher concentrations of HLE-alpha 1AT (64.3 +/- 43.1 vs. 30.1 +/- 7.7 ng/l, P<0.001), calprotectin (151.6 +/- 97.8 vs. 69.9 +/- 22.1 ng/l, P<0.001) and lactoferrin (243.2 +/- 102.0 vs. 129.7 +/- 32.7 ng/l, P<0.001) than in the control group were found. In patients with UC higher plasma concentrations of HLE-alpha 1AT (62.0 +/- 30.9 vs. 30.1 +/- 7.7 ng/l, P<0.001), calprotectin (149.6 +/- 72.3 vs. 69.9 +/- 22.1 ng/l, P<0.001) and lactoferrin (242.6 +/- 107.5 vs 129.7 +/- 32.7 ng/l, P<0.001) than in the control group were found. HLE-alpha 1AT/NEU and lactoferrin/NEU ratios in patients with UC were significantly higher compared with patients with CD. Calprotectin (P=0.010) and lactoferrin (P=0.023) levels were higher in patients with the active compared with inactive phase of CD. Conclusions: The diagnostic characteristics of plasma granulocyte protein concentrations indicate the usefulness of these tests in the diagnosis of IBD. Higher HLE-alpha 1AT and lactoferrin/NEU ratios in patients with UC than with CD may suggest the usefulness of these ratios in differential diagnostics. Plasma calprotectin and lactoferrin levels may be useful in CD activity assessment.",118
"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is commonly associated with disordered or disturbed sleep. The relationships of ADHD with sleep problems, psychiatric comorbidities and medications are complex and multidirectional. Evidence from published studies comparing sleep in individuals with ADHD with typically developing controls is most concordant for associations of ADHD with: hypopnea/apnea and peripheral limb movements in sleep or nocturnal motricity in polysomnographic studies; increased sleep onset latency and shorter sleep time in actigraphic studies; and bedtime resistance, difficulty with morning awakenings, sleep onset difficulties, sleep-disordered breathing, night awakenings and daytime sleepiness in subjective studies. ADHD is also frequently coincident with sleep disorders (obstructive sleep apnea, peripheral limb movement disorder, restless legs syndrome and circadian-rhythm sleep disorders). Psychostimulant medications are associated with disrupted or disturbed sleep, but also 'paradoxically' calm some patients with ADHD for sleep by alleviating their symptoms. Long-acting formulations may have insufficient duration of action, leading to symptom rebound at bedtime. Current guidelines recommend assessment of sleep disturbance during evaluation of ADHD, and before initiation of pharmacotherapy, with healthy sleep practices the first-line option for addressing sleep problems. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the relationships between ADHD and sleep, and presents a conceptual model of the modes of interaction: ADHD may cause sleep problems as an intrinsic feature of the disorder; sleep problems may cause or mimic ADHD; ADHD and sleep problems may interact, with reciprocal causation and possible involvement of comorbidity; and ADHD and sleep problems may share a common underlying neurological etiology.",128
"This paper develops a model for cancer screening and cancer incidence data, accommodating the partially unobserved disease status, clustered data structures, general covariate effects, and dependence between exams. The true unobserved cancer and detection status of screening participants are treated as latent variables, and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm is used to estimate the Bayesian posterior distributions of the diagnostic error rates and disease prevalence. We show how the Bayesian approach can be used to draw inferences about screening exam properties and disease prevalence while allowing for the possibility of conditional dependence between two exams. The techniques are applied to the estimation of the diagnostic accuracy of mammography and clinical breast examination using data from the Ontario Breast Screening Program in Canada.

"The mean age of the world population has steadily increased in the last decades, as a result of increased life expectancy and reduced birth rate. Global aging has led to a greater worldwide cost for healthcare: hormonal alterations contribute to the pathogenesis of several conditions and might cause a significant reduction in the perceived sense of well-being. Menopause is archetypal of hormonal alterations occurring during aging: in males, sex hormones do not decrease abruptly, yet testosterone levels decrease steadily and continuously during aging, ultimately resulting in late-onset hypogonadism. Treatment of this condition might mitigate most symptoms; however, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) should be prescribed only in selected patients and it should not be considered as an antiaging treatment. In recent years, different authors have questioned health risks associated with testosterone treatment; while position statements from many scientific societies seem to be reassuring, the Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning in regard to the possible side effects of this therapy. We aim to review recent controversies and discoveries in regard to TRT.",9
"Most research on threat documents its negative consequences. Similarly, most research on intergroup contexts has emphasized their negative behavioral effects. Drawing on the Meaning Maintenance Model and recent perspectives on the potential for positivity in intergroup conflict, we predicted that meaning threat can produce both antisocial and prosocial responses to intergroup conflict, depending on people's preexisting meaning frameworks. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that under meaning threat, low ingroup glorifiers strengthened their support for peaceful conflict resolution, whereas high ingroup glorifiers strengthened their support for military-based conflict resolution. In the context of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Study 3 found that low glorification was associated with greater support for peace during ""hot"" (but not ""cold"") conflict, because hot conflict reduced their meaning in life. These findings are consistent with the notion that when meaning is threatened, people affirm their preexisting values-whether prosocial or antisocial-even in the context of intergroup conflict.",65
"Background: There is increased clinical and political attention towards integrating general and psychiatric emergency departments (ED). However, research into psychiatric service users' experiences regarding general EDs is limited.Aim: To identify and summarize current, qualitative evidence regarding service users' experiences attending EDs. A secondary aim is to apply and test the newly developed CERQual approach to summarizing qualitative review findings.Methods: A systematic literature review of five databases based on PRISMA guidelines yielded 3334 unique entries. Screening by title/abstract identified 57 studies and, after full text assessment, nine studies were included. The included studies were critically appraised using CASP. Thematic synthesis was applied for data extraction and identification of findings. The CERQual approach was utilized to assess the confidence of the findings.Results: The results of the review showed moderate confidence in the findings that service users experience meeting caring and judgmental ED staff, and that waiting times and a stressful environment are integral to their ED experiences. In contrast, low-to-very low confidence was seen in the findings that service users experience having their symptoms ignored and that EDs are used due to a lack of alternatives. A companion may improve service users experience and outcome of ED visits.Conclusion: Service users experience stress and discomfort in the ED. Service users highly appreciate knowing staff who can ease the discomfort. Overall, the results of this review speak in favour of integrated EDs where service users' needs are more likely to be recognized and accommodated.",72
"The election of Donald Trump as the 45th U.S. President earmarks a new beginning of American domestic and foreign policies, to which his populist thinking and unconventional approach have caused great uncertainty. While recognizing the challenges that President Trump may bring to the world in general and China-U.S. relations in particular, the Chinese government under the core leadership of President Xi Jinping firmly believes in the world's general trend for sustained progress, remains committed to the track of win-win cooperation with other countries, and is adopting both reactive and proactive attitudes toward the great changes in global arenas while taking every precaution against the worst possible scenario. To better manage China-U.S>relations at this critical juncture of world development, it is imperative for both countries to adapt to various new changes, deepen their mutual understanding of each other's diplomatic philosophy, and continue sharing the dividends of peace and development. If the two countries can manage to pass the first few rounds of tests through more active conceptual matching-up and pragmatic cooperation, they will be in a better position to realize their respective national agendas of ""rejuvenation of the Chinese nation"" and ""making America great again."" Otherwise, both countries and even the whole world may fall into devastating confrontation and escalating conflicts.",66
"ERp57 is a member of a protein disulfide isomerase family and is a chaperone responsible for the correct folding of newly synthesized glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and in the assembly of the major histocompatibility complex class I in the endogenous pathway of antigen presentation. This study reports the identification of a full length ERp57 cDNA in rainbow trout that encodes a putative 477aa mature protein with an additional signal sequence of 16aa. The trout protein shared 75% identity with the human homolog, but interestingly did not include either a C terminal endoplasmic reticulum retention signal, Q/KEDL in humans, or a nuclear localization signal which is highly conserved in mammals. Amino acid sequence alignment revealed conservation of four classical domains in trout ERp57 and two conserved active CXXC redox motifs. Trout ERp57 protein was identified as a single band around 57 kDa. Southern blotting analysis revealed that there two copies of the ERp57 gene in the trout genome and northern blotting showed a wide tissue distribution of gene expression in various tissues with the highest expression in liver and egg. This study showed for the first time in teleost that ERp57 transcript is upregulated in response to immune stimuli such as double stranded RNA or phytohemagglutinin. Furthermore, upon treatment with ER stress inducer A23187, trout ERp57 protein expression levels were increased both in peripheral blood leukocytes and the RTS11 macrophage like cell line after 6 and 8 h respectively. These findings suggest a possible conserved function for trout ERp57 in the ER and during the activation of the immune response. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",38
"Background: Migraine is a debilitating neurological disorder where trigeminovascular activation plays a key role. We have previously reported that local application of Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) onto the dura mater caused activation in rat trigeminal ganglion (TG) which was abolished by a systemic administration of kynurenic acid (KYNA) derivate (SZR72). Here, we hypothesize that this activation may extend to the trigeminal complex in the brainstem and is attenuated by treatment with SZR72. Methods: Activation in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) and the trigeminal tract (Sp5) was achieved by application of CFA onto the dural parietal surface. SZR72 was given intraperitoneally (i.p.), one dose prior CFA deposition and repeatedly daily for 7 days. Immunohistochemical studies were performed for mapping glutamate, c-fos, PACAP, substance P, IL-6, IL-1 beta and TNF alpha in the TNC/Sp5 and other regions of the brainstem and at the C-1-C-2 regions of the spinal cord. Results: We found that CFA increased c-fos and glutamate immunoreactivity in TNC and C-1-C-2 neurons. This effect was mitigated by SZR72. PACAP positive fibers were detected in the fasciculus cuneatus and gracilis. Substance P, TNFa, IL-6 and IL-1 beta immunopositivity were detected in fibers of Sp5 and neither of these molecules showed any change in immunoreactivity following CFA administration. Conclusion: This is the first study demonstrating that dural application of CFA increases the expression of c-fos and glutamate in TNC neurons. Treatment with the KYNA analogue prevented this expression.",127
"The flow of viscous fluid in the cochlea induces shear forces, which could provide benefit in clinical practice, for example to guide cochlear implant insertion or produce static pressure to the cochlear partition or wall. From a research standpoint, studying the effects of a viscous fluid in the cochlea provides data for better understanding cochlear fluid mechanics. However, cochlear perfusion with a viscous fluid may damage the cochlea. In this work we studied the physiological and anatomical effects of perfusing the cochlea with a viscous fluid. Gerbil cochleae were perfused at a rate of 2.4 mu L/min with artificial perilymph (AP) and sodium hyaluronate (Healon, HA) in four different concentrations (0.0625%, 0.125%, 0.25%, 0.5%). The different HA concentrations were applied either sequentially in the same cochlea or individually in different cochleae. The perfusion fluid entered from the round window and was withdrawn from basal scala vestibuli, in order to perfuse the entire perilymphatic space. Compound action potentials (CAP) were measured after each perfusion. After perfusion with increasing concentrations of HA in the order of increasing viscosity, the CAP thresholds generally increased. The threshold elevation after AP and 0.0625% HA perfusion was small or almost zero, and the 0.125% HA was a borderline case, while the higher concentrations significantly elevated CAP thresholds. Histology of the cochleae perfused with the 0.0625% HA showed an intact Reissner's membrane (RM), while in cochleae perfused with 0.125% and 0.25% HA RM was torn. Thus, the CAP threshold elevation was likely due to the broken RM, likely caused by the shear stress produced by the flow of the viscous fluid. Our results and analysis indicate that the cochlea can sustain, without a significant CAP threshold shift, up to a 1.5 Pa shear stress. Beside these finding, in the 0.125% and 0.25% HA perfusion cases, a temporary CAP threshold shift was observed, perhaps due to the presence and then clearance of viscous fluid within the cochlea, or to a temporary position shift of the Organ of Corti. After 0.5% HA perfusion, a short latency positive peak (P0) appeared in the CAP waveform. This P0 might be due to a change in the cochlea's traveling-wave pattern, or distortion in the cochlear microphonic. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",86
"MicroCT imaging allows for noninvasive microstructural evaluation of mineralized bone tissue, and is essential in studies of small animal models of bone and joint diseases. Automatic segmentation and evaluation of articular surfaces is challenging. Here, we present a novel method to create knee joint surface models, for the evaluation of PTOA-related joint changes in the rat using an atlas-based diffeomorphic registration to automatically isolate bone from surrounding tissues. As validation, two independent raters manually segment datasets and the resulting segmentations were compared to our novel automatic segmentation process. Data were evaluated using label map volumes, overlapmetrics, Euclidean distance mapping, and a time trial. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated to compare methods, and were greater than 0.90. Total overlap, union overlap, and mean overlap were calculated to compare the automatic and manual methods and ranged from 0.85 to 0.99. A Euclidean distance comparison was also performed and showed no measurable difference between manual and automatic segmentations. Furthermore, our new method was 18 times faster than manual segmentation. Overall, this study describes a reliable, accurate, and automatic segmentation method for mineralized knee structures from microCT images, and will allow for efficient assessment of bony changes in small animal models of PTOA.",15
"Introduction: Given that youth with chronic pain frequently experience disruptions in eating patterns that may place them at risk for disordered eating, the purpose of this study was to examine the clinical characteristics and illness course of adolescents with chronic pain and comorbid eating disorders. Methods: Using a retrospective chart review, 34 adolescents with chronic pain and concurrent eating disorders were identified. These adolescents were compared with 34 age-, gender-, and eating disorder symptom-matched adolescents who had an eating disorder without chronic pain. Results: The majority of adolescents with chronic pain and an eating disorder had a primary medical diagnosis of abdominal pain (n = 14), followed by autonomic dysfunction n = 10) and headache (n = 6). Although in 41.2% of teens with chronic pain, eating disorder symptoms developed after the onset of their pain, 35.3% reported having eating disorder symptoms before they experienced chronic pain. Body mass index did not differ between the groups, but the duration of eating disorder symptoms was significantly longer for the chronic pain group (p < .001). Discussion: Despite comparable severity, eating disorders are undetected for longer periods in patients with chronic pain, which may contribute to a poorer prognosis. Implications for eating disorder conceptualization, detection, and treatment are discussed.",67
"We present a visual assistive system that features mobile face detection and recognition in an unconstrained environment from a mobile source using convolutional neural networks. The goal of the system is to effectively detect individuals that approach facing towards the person equipped with the system. We find that face detection and recognition becomes a very difficult task due to the movement of the user which causes camera shakes resulting in motion blur and noise in the input for the visual assistive system. Due to the shortage of related datasets, we create a dataset of videos captured from a mobile source that features motion blur and noise from camera shakes. This makes the application a very challenging aspect of face detection and recognition in unconstrained environments. The performance of the convolutional neural network is further compared with a cascade classifier. The results show promising performance in daylight and artificial lighting conditions while the challenges lie for moonlight conditions with the need for reduction of false positives in order to develop a robust system. We also provide a framework for implementation of the system with smartphones and wearable devices for video input and auditory notification from the system to guide the visually impaired.

"Rationale: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a prototypic single-gene disease caused mainly by mutations in genes encoding sarcomere proteins. Despite the remarkable advances, the causal genes in approximate to 40% of the HCM cases remain unknown, typically in small families and sporadic cases, wherein cosegregation could not be established. Objective: To test the hypothesis that the missing causal genes in HCM is, in part, because of an oligogenic cause, wherein the pathogenic variants do not cosegregate with the phenotype. Methods and Results: A clinically affected trio with HCM underwent clinical evaluation, electrocardiography, echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and whole exome sequencing. Pathogenic variants in the whole exome sequencing data were identified using established algorithms. Family members were genotyped by Sanger sequencing and cosegregation was analyzed. The siblings had a severe course, whereas the mother had a mild course. Variant analysis showed that the trio shared 145 heterozygous pathogenic variants in 139 genes, including 2 in cardiomyopathy genes TTN and ALPK3. The siblings also had the pathogenic variant p. Ala13Thr variant in MYL2, a known gene for HCM. The sibling(s father also carried the p. Ala13Thr variant, in whom an unambiguous diagnosis of HCM could not be made because of concomitant severe aortic stenosis. The TTN variant segregated with HCM, except in a 7-year-old boy, who had a normal phenotype. The ALPK3 variant, shared by the affected trio, did not segregate with the phenotype. Conclusions: We posit that a subset of HCM might be oligogenic caused by multiple pathogenic variants that do not perfectly cosegregate with the phenotype.",42
"Current mechanical methods for oil extraction are based on electric motor drive systems. The existing schemes of oilfield power supply and electrical system operating modes actualize the development and implementation of energy conservation measures and high potential lying in raising the energy efficiency of oilfield equipment. With the current state of the power supply network, new oil wells and increasing power consumption associated with the growth of crude oil production require new technical and organizational measures ensuring reliability of power supply, reduction of energy losses and maintenance of the desired voltage level of the operating equipment. This paper presents an example of a technical solution, its justification and implementation aimed at reducing energy losses in the oilfield electrical power network. Reactive power compensation devices and filter compensating devices gradually put into operation within the existing power schemes enabled to increase flow capacity of the power transmission line in order to commission a new oil well. The authors have analyzed the operating modes of electrical system used at two oil fields and showed a potential for introducing effective energy conservation measures.",53
"The object of this study is to develop a self-tuning fractional order proportional-integral-derivative (SFOPID) controller for controlling the mover position of a direct drive linear voice coil motor (VCM) accurately under different operational conditions. The fractional order proportional-integral-derivative (FOPID) controller can improve the control performances of the conventional integer order PID controller with respect to the additional fractional differential and integral orders; however, choosing five interdependent control parameters including proportional, integral, and derivative gains, as well as fractional differential and integral orders appropriately is arduous in practical applications. In this regard, the SFOPID controller is proposed in which the five control parameters are optimized dynamically and concurrently according to an adaptive differential evolution algorithm with a high efficiency adaptive selection mechanism. Experimental results reveal that the SFOPID controller outperforms PID and FOPID controllers with regard to the nonlinear VCM control system under both nominal and payload conditions.",59
"This review discusses recent advances in materials engineering to control thermal conductivity. We begin by presenting theories of heat conduction for general material classes, focusing on common approximations and trends. Next, we discuss characterization techniques for measuring thermal conductivity and the underlying transport properties. Advanced materials at the frontiers of thermal transport, such as rattlers, complex unit cells, nanowires, and nanocomposites, are treated in depth using experimental data and theoretical predictions. The review closes by highlighting several promising areas for further development.",89
"Objectives: To determine whether bundled payments are feasible in the orthopaedic fracture setting, and the potential economic implications of this reimbursement structure. Design: Prospective. Setting: Multicenter. Patients/Participants: Between 2004 and 2014, a total of 23,643 operatively treated patients with fracture and 544,067 patients with total joint arthroplasty (TJA) were identified using the New York State Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System database. Interventions: Severity of illness (SOI), hospital charges ($USD), length of stay (LOS; days), and discharge disposition (homebound vs. not) were collected. Main Outcome Measurements: Patients were subdivided into groups of minor and severe SOI. Differences in hospital charges, LOS, and discharge disposition were analyzed. Differences in charges, LOS, and discharges were further analyzed based on minor and severe SOI. Results: The difference in hospital charge between patients with minor or severe SOI undergoing elective TJA ranged between 153% and 211%. In contrast, patients undergoing fracture surgery exhibited differences ranging from 314% to 489% between minor and severe SOI levels. Similar differences were observed regarding mean hospital LOS and homebound discharge disposition, with patients with fracture demonstrating greater sensitivity to increasing SOI. Conclusions: Although bundled payments may be a viable option for patients undergoing elective TJA, this payment model requires particular attention when applied to fracture care.",8
"In this paper we design a sure independent ranking and screening procedure for censored regression (cSIRS, for short) with ultrahigh dimensional covariates. The inverse probability weighted cSIRS procedure is model-free in the sense that it does not specify a parametric or semiparametric regression function between the response variable and the covariates. Thus, it is robust to model mis-specification. This model-free property is very appealing in ultrahigh dimensional data analysis, particularly when there is lack of information for the underlying regression structure. The cSIRS procedure is also robust in the presence of outliers or extreme values as it merely uses the rank of the censored response variable. We establish both the sure screening and the ranking consistency properties for the cSIRS procedure when the number of covariates p satisfies , where a is a positive constant and n is the available sample size. The advantages of cSIRS over existing competitors are demonstrated through comprehensive simulations and an application to the diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma data set.",7
"Non-malleable codes, defined by Dziembowski, Pietrzak, and Wichs (ICS '10), provide roughly the following guarantee: if a codeword c encoding some message x is tampered to c' = f (c) such that c' not equal c, then the tampered message x' contained in c' reveals no information about x. The nonmalleable codes have applications to immunizing cryptosystems against tampering attacks and related -key attacks. One cannot have an efficient non-malleable code that protects against all efficient tampering functions f. However, in this paper we show ""the next best thing"": for any polynomial bound s given a -priori, there is an efficient non-malleable code that protects against all tampering functions f computable by a circuit of size s. More generally, for any family of tampering functions of size vertical bar F vertical bar <= 2(s), there is an efficient non-malleable code that protects against all f is an element of F. The rate of our codes, defined as the ratio of message to codeword size, approaches 1. Our results are information -theoretic and our main proof technique relies on a careful probabilistic method argument using limited independence. As a result, we get an efficiently samplable family of efficient codes, such that a random member of the family is non-malleable with overwhelming probability. Alternatively, we can view the result as providing an efficient non-malleable code in the ""common reference string"" model. We also introduce a new notion of non-malleable key derivation, which uses randomness x to derive a secret key y = h(x) in such a way that, even if x is tampered to a different value x' = f (x), the derived key y' = h(x') does not reveal any information about y. Our results for non-malleable key derivation are analogous to those for non-malleable codes. As a useful tool in our analysis, we rely on the notion of ""leakage -resilient storage"" of Davi, Dziembowski, and Venturi (SCN '10), and, as a result of independent interest, we also significantly improve on the parameters of such schemes.",57
"Introduction: Serum (1-3)-beta-d-glucan (BDG) assay has been proposed as an adjunct for the rapid diagnosis of invasive fungal infection (IFI). However, false-positive results have been reported following transfusion of blood products in adults. Aims: To assess the relationship between blood product transfusion and elevated BDG in neonates. Method: Retrospective study including neonates 32 weeks, with no fungal colonization or infection, in whom BDG assay was performed for suspicion of IFI. Patients were classified in Transfusion (n=78) and No Transfusion (n=55) groups depending on whether or not they were transfused. Clinical, biochemical and microbiological characteristics were recorded. A BDG assay >80pg/mL was considered as positive. Statistical analyses: bivariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results (median, IQR): One hundred and thirty-three infants were included (gestational age 28.4 weeks, 26.9-30; birth weight 1000g, 847-1300). BDG was higher in the Transfusion group (170pg/mL, 65-317) than in the No Transfusion group (57pg/mL, 34-108; p<0.001). False-positive BDG assay results were associated with red blood cells (RBC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions. Conclusion: BDG is increased after RBC and FFP transfusions in neonates, leading to overdiagnosis of IFI. Fungal colonization status in peripheral sites and central cultures could help to reduce the risk of misdiagnosis.",126
"Objective - This study focuses on the occurrence of musculoskeletal disorders in children presented in general practice. Known epidemiological studies addressing musculoskeletal diseases in childhood are scarce and based on a low number of episodes. Design and setting - Prospective study of all patient contacts in general practice. A total number of 161 general practitioners participated, divided into four groups, registering during four consecutive three-month periods. Patients - All children younger than 15 years of age who visited their GP during the registration period. All diagnoses and working hypotheses concerning musculoskeletal disorders were selected. Results - The total number of children in the study was 64 198. Disorders of the musculoskeletal system accounted for 3 699 (7.5%) of all 49 309 contacts and for 3046 (7.5%) of all 40 340 episodes. Of the 3 046 episodes registered for ICPC-chapter L (musculoskeletal), 2 562 (84%) were new episodes, i.e. not presented to the GP before. Fifty-four percent of all new episodes were acute injuries. In 22% of the new episodes the general practitioner made a symptom diagnosis. Differences by age and sex were found for a limited number of diagnosis categories. Conclusion - Children present disorders of the musculoskeletal system less often than adults; they also present different disorders to their general practitioners. The majority of disorders presented by children are acute injuries, mostly sprains and strains.",28
"Study ObjectiveA substantial proportion of antipsychotic (AP) use in veterans is for nonapproved indications (i.e., off-label prescribing). Not all off-label use is necessarily detrimental to patients, however, and in certain situations, off-label prescribing could be considered justifiable. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which off-label AP prescribing in a veteran population was potentially appropriate. DesignExpert panel and retrospective analysis. Data SourceVeterans Health Administration (VHA) Corporate Data Warehouse. PatientsA total of 69,823 veterans who had at least one pharmacy record for an AP medication during fiscal years 2005-2012. Measurements and Main ResultsAn expert panel was convened to determine if agreement exists on the appropriateness of AP use in various scenarios. The panel consisted of 10 experts in the field of psychiatry: nine physicians with various specialties, and one pharmacist. We used a modified RAND appropriateness method approach to identify potentially appropriate, uncertain, and inappropriate cases of AP use. The use of six second-generation APs was examined individually, and the use of first-generation APs was examined as a class. Based on data previously collected quantifying VHA AP use, the panel was given disease state scenarios for the most commonly occurring off-label diagnoses for AP prescriptions. Disease states were coupled with scenario modifiers that the expert panel considered potentially significant clinical factors. Among the four disease statesanxiety, dementia, insomnia, and posttraumatic stress disorder29 scenarios were investigated for each AP. None of the scenarios were judged by the expert panel to be appropriate for the use of APs. Of the 203 scenarios for all APs, 60% were judged to be inappropriate by the expert panel, and the remaining 40% were considered uncertain. Of the AP medications, risperidone (72%) and olanzapine (62%) were the most likely to be seen as uncertain, whereas first-generation APs (86%) were the most likely to be considered inappropriate in a given scenario. Widespread off-label use of APs outside of the approved indications of treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, or adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder, may not be an appropriate treatment option. According to this expert panel, no examined situations were considered appropriate for the use of APs. ConclusionThe consensus of our expert panel was that off-label AP use is uncertain at best and more likely, even in complicated cases, inappropriate. These findings strengthen the case for stronger control of APs in integrated health care settings such as the VHA, as well as better education and information for practitioners who provide care for patients with anxiety, dementia, insomnia, or posttraumatic stress disorder.",72
"A full-length cDNA, named LeEIN2 was cloned from tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) by RT-PCR and RACE. Then the genomic DNA sequence of Le EIN2 was isolated by LA (Long and Accurate) PCR and Inverse PCR. This DNA sequence was 6838 bp including six introns. The Le EIN2 cDNA was 4343 bp and contained a 3951 bp open reading frame, encoding a 142.63 kDa protein of 1316 amino acids. Comparison of this protein sequence with that of Arabidopsis and Petunia showed that the amino acid homology was 66 and 90%, respectively. Northern blotting analysis indicated that the expression level of the LeEIN2 in young leaves was higher than in mature leaves and senescent leaves. During the development of fruits, the expression of the Le EIN2 was detected before mature green stage and got up to maximum at mature green and breaker stages, then reduced rapidly after breaker stage. The expression level of LeEIN2 in wild type tomato fruit at mature green stage did not distinctively change when treated with exogenous ethylene.",38
"The study presents a selection of numerical and experimental results of producing hollow stepped shafts. The first part of this study describes the advantages of using hollow parts in machine design and discusses the main fields of their applications. Next, an innovative rotary compression method for producing stepped axes and shafts is proposed. In order to estimate the technological potential of rotary compression, we performed comprehensive numerical and experimental analyses of producing hollow stepped shafts by this new technique. First, the rotary compression process for hollow parts was modeled numerically by the finite element method. The 3D modeling was made using the Simufact Forming software. The numerical results were then verified by experimental tests conducted under laboratory conditions. The experiments were performed using a machine designed by the authors of the present study. The following variables were investigated in the experiments: the effect of billet wall thickness on the process, the quality and geometry of products, and variations in loads and torques. The experimental results confirmthat rotary compression can be used to produce hollow stepped shafts with a wide range of thicknesses.",85
"Ascospores are frequently found as airborne fungal spores and recognized in various areas as an important cause of respiratory allergies. The main objective of the study was to determine the relationship between airborne ascospores and meteorological parameters using multivariate canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and Spearman correlation. The aerobiological monitoring of fungal spores was performed over 5 years (2009-2013) using a Burkard volumetric spore traps. Seven main types of ascospores were identified: Leptosphaeria, Pleospora, Venturia, Diatrype, Chaetomium, Sporormiella and Ascobolus. The CCA results showed that all applied variables accounted for 27.4 % of the total variance in the spore data in the 5 years. The largest contribution to the total variance was explained in this period by the maximum air temperature (10.3 %). The effect of meteorological factors varied among years. The highest values of the total variance in the spore data, explained by the statistically significant variables, were observed in 2012 (28.6 %), with the highest contribution to minimum relative humidity (8.0 %). Most ascospores showed positive and statistically significant correlation with relative humidity and rainfall. In contrast, ascospores of Chaetomium were negatively correlated with precipitation and the relative humidity and positively with temperature. Based on these results, epidemiological and allergological studies must deserve more attention to estimate the allergenic potential of the ascospores.",105
"We investigated theory of mind (ToM) deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its possible connection to autobiographical memory (ABM). Patients and matched controls were evaluated and compared using a video-based ToM test, an autobiographical fluency task, and a neuropsychological test battery. We found that ToM deficits were positively associated with semantic ABM in the clinical group, whereas a positive relationship appeared between ToM and episodic ABM in controls. We hypothesize that this reflects the course of the disease as well as that semantic ABM is used for ToM processing, being still accessible in AD. Furthermore, we assume that it is also less efficient, which in turn leads to a specific deficit profile of social cognition.",62
"This article outlines major developments in knowledge about the human metabolism of ethanol. The results of a large number of controlled experiments aimed at measuring the rate of ethanol elimination from the blood are reported. The factors that influence the rate of ethanol elimination from blood, such as the amount of ethanol ingested, the drinking habits of the subjects, and the effect of food taken together with, or before, drinking were investigated. The slowest rate of ethanol disappearance was observed in a healthy male subject who ingested 0.68 g ethanol/kg body weight after an overnight (8 h) fast; the beta-slope was 9 mg/dL/h. The fastest rate of ethanol disappearance was observed in a male chronic alcoholic during detoxification: the beta-slope was 36 mg/dL/h. This four-fold difference in the rate of ethanol disposal should be considered when the pharmacokinetics of ethanol become an issue in drinking and driving trials, for example. when retrograde estimations are attempted.",32
"Energy Efficient medical equipment design is the current research trend in medical science. Now, scientists are shifting focus toward energy efficient medical equipment design, ECG machine is the commonly used medical equipment. If any medical equipment is consuming less power than the traditional counterpart, then the whole medical system will be more greener or energy efficient. Finally, it reduces the cost of medical treatment. In this work, we are going to design and implement energy efficient ECG machine using LVDCI (Low Voltage Digitally Control Impedance), SSTL (Stub Series Terminated Logic) and HSTL (High Speed Transistor Logic) I/O standard.",85
"Purpose: The 2010 consensus statement on diagnostic chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing recommended an array resolution >= 400 kb throughout the genoine as a balance of analytical and clinical sensitivity. In spite of the clear evidence for pathogenicity of large copy number variants (CNVs) in neurodevelopmental disorders and/or congenital anomalies, the significance of small, nonrecurrent CNVs (<500 kb) has not been well established in a clinical setting. Methods: We investigated the clinical significance of all nonpolymorphic small, nonrecurrent CNVs (<500 kb) in patients referred for CMA clinical testing over a period of 6 years, from 2009 to 2014 (a total of 4,417 patients). We excluded from our study patients with benign or likely benign CNVs and patients with only recurrent microdeletions/microduplications <500 kb. Results: In total, 383 patients (8.67%) were found to carry at least one small, nonrecurrent CNV, of whom 176 patients (3.98%) had one small CNV classified as a variant of uncertain significance (VUS), 45 (1.02%) had two or more small VUS CNVs, 20 (0.45%) had one small VUS CNV and a recurrent CNV, 113 (2.56%) had one small pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNV, 17 (0.38%) had two or more small pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNVs, and 12 (0.27%) had one small pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNV and a recurrent CNV. Within the pathogenic group, 80 of 142 patients (56% of all small pathogenic CNV cases) were found to have a single whole-gene or exonic deletion. The themes that emerged from our study are presented in the Discussion section. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the diagnostic clinical relevance of small, nonrecurrent CNVs <500kb during CMA clinical testing and underscores the need for careful clinical interpretation of these CNVs.",113
"Fluid flow through micro/nanofluidics is of utmost importance in analyzing mechanical, biological and medical systems. Biological liquids are often electrolytes that produce spontaneous electrokinetic effects when flowing through pores and channels. The streaming potential which is resultant of this electrokinetic phenomenon drives the ions in the channel to move in the direction opposite to the pressure driven flow and causes a resistance against fluid flow along the channel. It is simply similar to the case when the viscosity of the fluid is slightly increased. It is expected to have a lower flow rate in the presence of the electroviscous effects; however, understanding of these effects on thermal transport characteristics would be interesting. The present study attempts to present a theoretical investigation of the electroviscous effects on heat transfer in nanofluidics based on continuum fluid mechanics while boundary slip is assumed on the walls. Results show that the presence of electroviscous effects will remarkably enhance the heat transfer rate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",86
"Objective: Equol, an active metabolite possessing estrogen-like activity, is produced by the action of intestinal flora on soy isoflavones. There is an increasing evidence regarding its efficacy in the relief of menopausal symptoms, suppression of decreased bone mineral density, and lipid profile improvement. Only those with equol-producing capacity, however, seem to benefit. Thus, we examined the relationship between equol producer status and parameters associated with lifestyle-related diseases in women from their 20s to 80s. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 743 women (21-89 y; average age: 52.5 +/- 11.8 y) who have undergone health screening at Tokyo Midtown Medical Center and given consent to participate in the study. The relationship between equol producer status and metabolic parameters was assessed. Results: In our study, 236 women (32%) were equol producers. Equol producers had significantly lower triglycerides and higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels compared with nonproducers. Equol-producing women in their 50s showed significantly lower body fat level, visceral fat area, triglyceride levels, pulse wave velocity, uric acid levels, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein levels. In addition, women in their 60s showed significantly higher levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In multivariate logistic regression, for women in their 50s, equol production was significantly associated with lower arterial stiffness and uric acid levels, and a high ratio of eicosapentaenoic acid to arachidonic acid, whereas it was significantly associated with lower urinary N-telopeptides in their 60s. Conclusions: Equol producer status was associated with favorable metabolic parameters, in women in the early phase postmenopause, with the transitional periods noted with declining intrinsic estrogen levels.",9
"This paper focuses on the development of a distributed surface machining system. Traditional manufacturing engineering activity analysis has been conducted in developing the proposed system structure. The advantages of a distributed system structure such as easy to manage, high expandability and flexibility will enhance the efficiency of an integral system operation, and achieve the goal of networked manufacture. The IDEF0 was used to describe each stage of the traditional surface machining activities, and then UML ( Unified Modeling Language) technology was adopted to verify the feasibility and accuracy of the established integrated system. The developed distributed system structure and sub-functional modules (CAD/CAM/CAPP) haze been implemented based on the proposed systematic approach; and a freeform surface has been used as an example for verification. The proposed approach has been successfully implemented and could be adopted to assist engineers in integrating machining activities that are located in dispersed places; and various domains experts also can exchange their expertise among themselves. Thus, the development time of a product machining processes can be shortened and so is its enhancement on the competitive advantages. In addition I this distributed system has also integrated multi-functional ontology and service agent to facilitate the selection and reconfiguration in manufacturing customization. The proposed system has presented the feasibility in incorporating the agent-based technology in a distributed freeform surface machining environment. Service agents communicate via pre-defined performatives underlying knowledge query and manipulation language (KQML) for the surface machining capability. The developed system has then successfully demonstrated the feasibility in implementing the agent-based technology into a distributed surface machining system.",84
"Among uncertain graph queries, reachability, i.e., the probability that one vertex is reachable from another, is likely the most fundamental one. Although this problem has been studied within the field of network reliability, solutions are implemented on a single computer and can only handle small graphs. However, as the size of graph applications continually increases, the corresponding graph data can no longer fit within a single computer's memory and must therefore be distributed across several machines. Furthermore, the computation of probabilistic reachability queries is #P-complete making it very expensive even on small graphs. In this paper, we develop an efficient distributed strategy, called DistR, to solve the problem of reachability query over large uncertain graphs. Specifically, we perform the task in two steps: distributed graph reduction and distributed consolidation. In the distributed graph reduction step, we find all of the maximal subgraphs of the original graph, whose reachability probabilities can be calculated in polynomial time, compute them and reduce the graph accordingly. After this step, only a small graph remains. In the distributed consolidation step, we transform the problem into a relational join process and provide an approximate answer to the #P-complete reachability query. Extensive experimental studies show that our distributed approach is efficient in terms of both computational and communication costs, and has high accuracy.",2
"A corona is a layer of macromolecules formed on a nanoparticle surface in vivo. It can substantially change the biological identity of nanomaterials and possibly trigger adverse responses from the body tissues. Dissecting the role of the corona in the development of a particular disease may provide profound insights for understanding toxicity of nanomaterials in general. In our present study, we explored the capability of different silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) to induce silicosis in the mouse lung and analyzed the composition of coronas formed on these particles. We found that SiNPs of certain size and surface chemistry could specifically recruit transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1)intotheircorona, which subsequently induces the development of lung fibrosis. Once embedded into the corona on SiNPs, TGF-beta l was remarkably more stable than in its free form, and its fibrosis-triggering activity was significantly prolonged. Our study meaningfully demonstrates that a specific corona component on a certain nanoparticle could initiate a particular pathogenic process in a clinically relevant disease model. Our findings may shed light on the understanding of molecular mechanisms of human health risks correlated with exposure to small-scale substances.",3
"Gender ideologies in Cape Verde are shifting. Individuals find themselves caught between changing tides, pushed and pulled in opposite directions by divergent gendered expectations. The article examines the different ways in which young women and men take recourse to tactics in response to the tensions that arise as they deal with changing gender ascriptions in the midst of their relations with community and kin. Women, in particular, are unevenly affected by traditional demands and expectations whilst they cross the boundaries of traditional gender roles in their pursuit of enhanced education and more sexual freedom. Yet, their actions are not characterized by an outright rejection of traditional gender ideologies, but rather by piecemeal tactical manoeuvres to plot a route through the centrifugal forces at play.",77
"Heritable predisposition is an important cause of cancer in children and adolescents. Although a large number of cancer predisposition genes and their associated syndromes and malignancies have already been described, it appears likely that there are more pediatric cancer patients in whom heritable cancer predisposition syndromes have yet to be recognized. In a consensus meeting in the beginning of 2016, we convened experts in Human Genetics and Pediatric Hematology/Oncology to review the available data, to categorize the large amount of information, and to develop recommendations regarding when a cancer predisposition syndrome should be suspected in a young oncology patient. This review summarizes the current knowledge of cancer predisposition syndromes in pediatric oncology and provides essential information on clinical situations in which a childhood cancer predisposition syndrome should be suspected.",34
"In this study, a new versatile active element, namely multifunction current differencing cascaded transconductance amplifier (MCDCTA), is proposed. This device which adopts a simple configuration enjoys the performances of low-voltage, low-input and high-output impedance, wide bandwidth etc. It simplifies the design of the current-mode analog signal processing circuit greatly, especially the design of high-order filter and oscillator circuits. Moreover, an example as a new current-mode multiphase sinusoidal oscillator (MSO) using MCDCTA is described in this paper. The proposed oscillator, which employs only one MCDCTA and minimum grounded passive elements, is easy to be realized. It can provide random n (n being odd or even) output current signals and these output currents are equally spaced in phase all at high output impedance terminals. Its oscillation condition and the oscillation frequency can be adjusted independently, linearly and electronically by controlling the bias currents of MCDCTA. The operation of the proposed oscillator has been testified through PSPICE simulation and experimental results.",52
"High piezo-photo catalytic efficiency of degrading organic pollutants has been realized from CuS/ZnO nanowires using both solar and mechanical energy. CuS/ZnO heterostructured nanowire arrays are compactly/vertically aligned on stainless steel mesh by a simple two-step wet-chemical method. The mesh supported nanocomposites can facilitate an efficient light harvesting due to the large surface area and can also be easily removed from the treated solution. Under both solar and ultrasonic irradiation, CuS/ZnO nanowires can rapidly degrade methylene blue (MB) in aqueous solution, and the recyclability is investigated. In this process, the ultrasonic assistance can greatly enhance the photocatalytic activity. Such a performance can be attributed to the coupling of the built-in electric field of heterostructures and the piezoelectric field of ZnO nanowires. The built-in electric field of the heterostructure can effectively separate the photogenerated electrons/holes and facilitate the carrier transportation. The CuS component can improve the visible light utilization. The piezoelectric field created by ZnO nanowires can further separate the photogenerated electrons/holes through driving them to migrate along opposite directions. The present results demonstrate a new water-pollution solution in green technologies for the environmental remediation at the industrial level.",96
"Introduction: Postpartum depression is a prevalent disorder affecting many women of reproductive age. Despite increasing public awareness, it is frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated leading to significant maternal morbidity and adverse child outcomes. When identified, postpartum depression is usually treated as major depressive disorder. Many studies have identified the postpartum as a period of high risk for first presentations and relapses of bipolar disorder.Areas covered: This article reviews the acute and prophylactic treatment of postpartum major depressive disorder, bipolar depression and major depressive disorder with mixed features. The safety of antidepressant and mood stabilizing medications in pregnancy and breastfeeding will also be reviewed.Expert commentary: Differentiating postpartum major depressive disorder and postpartum bipolar depression can be difficult given their clinical similarities but accurate identification is vital for initiating proper treatment. Antidepressants are the mainstay of drug treatment for postpartum major depressive disorder, yet randomized controlled trials have shown conflicting results. A paucity of evidence exists for the effectiveness of antidepressant prophylaxis in the prevention of recurrences of major depressive disorder. Mood stabilizing medications reduce the risk of postpartum bipolar depression relapse but no randomized controlled trials have examined their use in the acute or prophylactic treatment of postpartum bipolar depression.",69
"This paper presents a moderated target assembly design study for minor actinide (MA) transmutation in the first-stage sodium-cooled fast reactor (FR) to reduce the amount of MA to be sent to the second-stage accelerator driven system (ADS) in a two-stage FR/ADS fuel cycle option. In order to minimize the local power peaking problem induced by moderated target assemblies, the target assemblies were loaded in the reflector region. Using MA-40Zr target composition and ZrH1.6 moderator, an optimum MA target assembly design was developed to maximize the MA destruction within the practical thermal design limits on the cladding inner wall temperature. Long-lived fission product pins were used as thermal neutron filters to reduce the local power peaking in the adjacent fuel assemblies due to the thermal neutron leakage from the moderated target assembly. The performance characteristics of the FR with moderated target assemblies were evaluated by performing detailed neutronics and thermal-hydraulics analyses. Analysis results showed that the use of MA target assemblies reduces the amount of MA to be sent to ADS by a factor of six without deteriorating safety characteristics. As a result, the electricity sharing of ADS in a nuclear park composed of FRs and ADSs was reduced to 0.3% from 1.9%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",83
"Engineering common sense in this study refers to the students' level of knowledge of elementary engineering and their application. This characteristic is considered essential for facilitating students to be able to move on to the more involved topics in engineering. An assessment of common sense has been carried out among newly enrolled students in Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering Programs by using the marks obtained from several questions in a test. The results showed that the students who should have already mastered simple mathematical operations and hence having common sense, a significant proportion of them failed to apply it. Based on answers to three simple questions the assessment showed two extremes of common sense levels with an almost 50: 50 distribution, one at the lowest and the other at the highest. Although the admission grade points for this cohort of students are considered high, it appears that there is a problem with common sense for half of them. Do these students think that once they enter tertiary level engineering studies, learning becomes so formal that there is no room for using common sense? (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",84
"We present a broadband and polarization-insensitive terahertz metamaterial absorber formed from double-layered same-sized patterned square patches on top of a metallic ground plane. The combination of the two same-sized metallic patches gives rise to an absorption bandwidth of 380 GHz with absorption over 90%. The full width at half maximum of this device with respect to the central resonance frequency can be up to 33%, which is double that of a single-layered structure. The mechanism of the broadband absorber is attributed to longitudinal coupling between layers, and a hybridized charge distribution model is proposed for analyzing the origin of the resonance bandwidth. The proposed absorber has potential applications in detection, imaging and stealth technology.",98

"Introduction: In their previous work, the authors reported findings from 30 years on the incidence of hematological malignancies in Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg county, Hungary. Until now there are no other studies on this topic available in Hungary. Aim: Detailed analysis of epidemiologic features of patients with Philadelphia-negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders was carried out. Method: During a 33-year period (between January 1, 1983 and December 31, 2015) 4523 adult patients with hematologic malignancies were recorded in the leukaemia/lymphoma registry of Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg county. Among them, 255 patients with polycytaemia vera, 102 with primary myelofibrosis, and 331 with essential thrombocytaemia were registered. Results: The incidence of polycythaemia vera and essential thrombocythaemia in Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg county showed an increasing tendency, with an overall incidence rate of 1.35 and 1.75/100 000 inhabitants/year, respectively; while the incidence of primary myelofibrosis decreased in the course of years (0.54/100 000 inhabitants/year). In cases of polycythaemia vera and primary myelofibrosis the male: female ratio was found to be equal, however essential thrombocythaemia showed a female dominance. The mean age of patients with polycythaemia vera was 65 (21-95) years, similar to essential thrombocythaemia with 65 (19-85) years, and to primary myelofibrosis with 65.5 (33-84) years. There were only two villages found in this county where the occurrence of patients with Philadelphia-negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders per one thousand inhabitants was significantly higher, than the average (1.22). In every familial cases of these, the manifestation of the disease in the second and the third generations became earlier than in the first genetration. The perceived average degree of the anteposition (anticipation) was found to be 22 years. Conclusion: The epidemiologic features of Philadelphia-negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders in Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg county are essentially similar to data published in the literature.",7
"Computer programming subject is a core ingredient for most of the engineering disciplines. However for the first year engineering, teaching and learning fundamentals of programming language like C has been considered as a great challenge to both teachers and novice learners. The challenges in learning the programming languages are: the learners are not able to analyze the flow of program, cannot fix errors or not able to debug the program, usually dependent on others for problem solving, bug fixing. Programming skills and documentation are the most important aspects of software development. The structure of C program with proper indentation; comments & proper named variables can reduce most of the general compiler errors. The study proposes a novice way of teaching C language programming with effective program writing skills for the beginners. The experiment is conducted for the First year Civil engineering students and the course is Computer Programming based on C language. A training session on effective program writing skills is conducted, to improve the ability of program writing skills with minimized compiler errors for novice learners. The effect of the experiment is verified with Pretest & Posttest before and after the training session. It is observed that the program written with proper indentation, comments and proper named variable can reduce the number of compiler errors and more than 60% of the student have written & executed the given C programs successfully in a stipulated time.",40
"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) consists of large number of spatially distributed configurable sensors, to meet the requirements of industrial, military, precision agriculture and health monitoring applications with ease of implementation and maintenance cost. Transmission of data requires both energy and quality of service (QoS) aware routing to ensure efficient use of the sensors and effective access of the gathered information. Design of WSNs considering its issues is challenging task and leads to complex algorithm design which are difficult to analyze by analytical methods and by physical measurements. Deploying test-beds supposes a huge effort. In deed Computer aided simulation is the feasible approach for analysis of WSNs. We addressed different types of simulators along with their key features and their applicability for simulation in numerous application areas.",35
"The purpose of this study was to determine whether intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) -derived parameters and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) could act as imaging biomarkers for predicting antifungal treatment response. Forty-six consecutive patients (mean age, 33.9 +/- 13.0 y) with newly diagnosed invasive fungal infection (IFI) in the lung according to EORTC/MSG criteria were prospectively enrolled. All patients underwent diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at 3.0 T using 11 b values (0-1000 sec/mm(2)). ADC, pseudodiffusion coffiecient D*, perfusion fraction f, and the diffusion coefficient D were compared between patients with favourable (n=32) and unfavourable response (n=14). f values were significantly lower in the unfavourable response group (12.6%+/- 4.4%) than in the favourable response group (30.2%+/- 8.6%) (Z=4.989, P0.05). Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses showed f to be a significant predictor for differentiation, with a sensitivity of 93.8% and a specificity of 92.9%. IVIM-MRI is potentially useful in the prediction of antifungal treatment response to patients with IFI in the lung. Our results indicate that a low perfusion fraction f may be a noninvasive imaging biomarker for unfavourable response. aEuro cent Recognition of IFI indicating clinical outcome is important for treatment decision-making. aEuro cent IVIM can reflect diffusion and perfusion information of IFI lesions separately. aEuro cent Perfusion characteristics of IFI lesions could help differentiate treatment response. aEuro cent An initial low f may predict unfavourable response in IFI.",126
"A series of three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and finite-element (FE) models, with a domain in the form of a water tank, were undertaken to simulate tsunami-induced bore impact on a discrete onshore structure on a dry bed. The fluid motion was simulated using the SPH-based software DualSPHysics. The tsunami-like waves were represented by solitary waves with different characteristics generated by the numerical paddle wavemaker. Numerical probes were uniformly distributed on the structure's vertical surface providing detailed measures of the pressure distribution across the structure. The peak impact locations on the structure's surface were specifically determined and the associated peak pressures then compared with the prediction of existing commonly used design equations. Using the pressure-time histories from the SPH model, FE analysis was conducted with Abaqus to model the dynamic response of a representative timber structure. The results show that the equations used to estimate the associated pressure for design purposes can be highly non-conservative. By gaining a detailed insight into the impact pressures and structure response, engineers have the potential means to optimise the design of structures under tsunami impact loads and improve survivability.",83
"ObjectiveElectrical stimulation via implanted electrodes that overlie the cortex of the brain is an upcoming neurosurgical technique that was hindered for a long time by insufficient knowledge of how the brain functions in a dynamic, physiological, and pathological way, as well as by technological limitations of the implantable stimulation devices. MethodsThis paper provides an overview of cortex stimulation via implantable devices and introduces future possibilities to improve cortex stimulation. ResultsCortex stimulation was initially used preoperatively as a technique to localize functions in the brain and only later evolved into a treatment technique. It was first used for pain, but more recently a multitude of pathologies are being targeted by cortex stimulation. These disorders are being treated by stimulating different cortical areas of the brain. Risks and complications are essentially similar to those related to deep brain stimulation and predominantly include haemorrhage, seizures, infection, and hardware failures. For cortex stimulation to fully mature, further technological development is required to predict its outcomes and improve stimulation designs. This includes the development of network science-based functional connectivity approaches, genetic analyses, development of navigated high definition transcranial alternating current stimulation, and development of pseudorandom stimulation designs for preventing habituation. ConclusionIn conclusion, cortex stimulation is a nascent but very promising approach to treating a variety of diseases, but requires further technological development for predicting outcomes, such as network science based functional connectivity approaches, genetic analyses, development of navigated transcranial electrical stimulation, and development of pseudorandom stimulation designs for preventing habituation.",104
"Twitter spam has become a critical problem nowadays. Recent works focus on applying machine learning techniques for Twitter spam detection, which make use of the statistical features of tweets. In our labeled tweets data set, however, we observe that the statistical properties of spam tweets vary over time, and thus, the performance of existing machine learning-based classifiers decreases. This issue is referred to as ""Twitter Spam Drift"". In order to tackle this problem, we first carry out a deep analysis on the statistical features of one million spam tweets and one million non-spam tweets, and then propose a novel Lfun scheme. The proposed scheme can discover ""changed"" spam tweets from unlabeled tweets and incorporate them into classifier's training process. A number of experiments are performed to evaluate the proposed scheme. The results show that our proposed Lfun scheme can significantly improve the spam detection accuracy in real-world scenarios.",1
"We applied computer-based text analyses of regressive imagery to verbal protocols of individuals engaged in creative problem-solving in two domains: visual art (23 experts, 23 novices) and computer programming (14 experts, 14 novices). Percentages of words involving primary process and secondary process thought, plus emotion-related words, were tabulated. Visual art protocols were higher in primary process thought and emotion-related words; those from programming were higher in secondary process thought. Almost no main effects of expertise or interactions were found. Correlations between the measures (particularly those involving emotion-related words) also varied as a function of task. This pattern suggests cognitive processes vary considerably across different creative problem-solving tasks or domains, and that a more domain-specific approach to creative cognition may be advisable. Further implications for integrating and consolidating some extant lines of creativity research are discussed.",40
"This paper presents design and measurement results of a fully integrated optical sensor for phase and amplitude detection of RF modulated optical signals up to 110 MHz in the near-infrared (NIR) region (650-850 nm) for use in frequency-domain spectroscopy instruments. The sensor consists of an NIR-sensitive photodetector monolithically integrated with a front-end analog amplifier and signal processing circuitry for amplitude and phase detection in an unmodified complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process. A high-gain, low-noise differential transimpedance amplifier (TIA) is implemented to amplify the photocurrent signal. Amplitude and phase resolution are evaluated with a 690 nm laser diode modulated at 100 MHz. The amplitude response exhibits 2.2 mV/mu W resolution with 0.4% linearity. The measured amplitude output noise is 72 mu V. The proposed phase detector detects 0 degrees-360 degrees phase difference with a measured average phase resolution of 4.8 mV/degree and 255 mu V output noise. The sensor is implemented in a 180 nm CMOS technology and consumes 23.4 mW from a 1.8 V supply voltage.",52
"Objective A higher rate of depressive symptoms is found among mothers of children with disabilities compared to other parents. However, there is a lack of study of mothers with children < 3 years of age participating in Early Intervention (EI) programs. This study aims to more fully describe the extent of mood disorders in these mothers including estimated prevalence, severity and factors associated with maternal mental health, using gold standard clinical diagnostic and symptom measures, and test models associating depressive symptoms with contextual factors and child behavior. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted with 106 women who had at least one child enrolled in EI. Mothers were interviewed and completed reliable, valid measures to evaluate mental health, health status, family conflict, parent-child interaction, self-efficacy, social support, child behavioral problems, hardship, endangerment, and child disability. Descriptive statistics and multivariate analyses were performed. Results We found 8 % of participants met all criteria for a Major Depressive Episode (MDE) with 44 % of the sample reporting a past episode and 43 % endorsing recurrent episodes. Using the CES-D to assess depressive symptom severity approximately 34 % of mothers screened in a clinically significant range. Using linear regression to predict severity of current depressive symptoms demonstrated that current depression severity was primarily predicted by poorer maternal health status, lower self-efficacy and past MDE (p < 0.05). Conclusions for practice A brief assessment of maternal mood, health and self-efficacy are important factors to assess when evaluating how to support mothers of children in EI.",18
"Certain types of variation are licenced by phonotactics. For example, the American English phoneme /t/ varies word-finally (ba[t] similar to ba[?]), but not word-initially. We used a Deese-Roediger-McDermott false memory paradigm to pursue the hypothesis that, given comparable information in the speech stream, varying words (such as bat) activate less strongly than non-varying words (such as tip). We presented listeners with lists of phonological neighbours, such as rat, ban, bet, etc. (neighbours of bat), and lip, tin, type, etc. (neighbours of tip), followed by recall and recognition tasks. Results showed that participants often ""remembered"" the unheard words bat and tip, replicating previous work indicating that activation from neighbours can produce false memories. Most importantly, false memory rates were significantly lower for bat compared to tip, suggesting that the presence of phonotactic conditions for variability affected the lexical activation of a word, compared to the absence of such conditions.",78
"Background Endogenous sex hormones have been related to cardiovascular outcomes and mortality. We hypothesized that sex hormones are related to atrial fibrillation (AF) in a community-based cohort of middle-aged to older men. Methods and Results We examined testosterone, estradiol, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in relation to incident AF in men participating in the Framingham Heart Study. We assessed the 10-year risk of AF in multivariable-adjusted hazard models. The cohort consisted of 1251 men (age, 68.08.2 years), of whom 275 developed incident AF. We identified a significant interaction between age and testosterone and, therefore, stratified men into age 55 to 69 years (n=786), 70 to 79 years (n=351), and 80 years (n=114). In men aged 55 to 69 years, each 1 SD decrease in testosterone was associated with hazard ratio (HR) 1.30 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.59) for incident AF. The association between testosterone and 10-year incident AF in men 70 to 79 years did not reach statistical significance. In men 80 years, a 1 SD decrease in testosterone was associated with HR 3.53 (95% CI, 1.96-6.37) for AF risk. Estradiol was associated with incident AF (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.01-1.26). Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate had a borderline association with risk of AF that was not statistically significant (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.99-1.28). Conclusions Testosterone and estradiol are associated with incident AF in a cohort of older men. Testosterone deficiency in men 80 years is strongly associated with AF risk. The clinical and electrophysiological mechanisms underlying the associations between sex hormones and AF in older men merit continued investigation.",6
"Gas-liquid mass transfer around Taylor bubbles moving in a meandering millimetric square channel was locally visualized and characterized in the present study. For that, the colorimetric technique proposed by Dietrich et al. (2013) was implemented. With this technique, the evolution of equivalent oxygen concentration fields in the liquid slugs passing through one and several bends was firstly described. In particular, it was observed how the flow structure (recirculation zones) inside the liquid slugs were twisted and split by the periodic bends (centrifugal effect), until reaching, after several bends, a uniform O-2 concentration inside the liquid slugs. The influence of the ""turning point"", joining two ""straight"" sections of meandering channel was also highlighted: a slowing down of the gas-liquid mass transfer was clearly shown. Volumetric mass transfer coefficients were determined at last by fitting the experimental axial profiles of averaged oxygen concentrations in the liquid slugs (before the turning point) with the ones predicted by a classical plug-flow model.

"The public profile of the Roman Catholic bishops of the United States results not simply from their own interventions in political life, but from the broad array of actions and actors within public Catholicism broadly conceived. This article assesses the contemporary profile of the American bishops from this broad angle, particularly in light of new dynamics under the papacy of Francis I. It does so by documenting public Catholicism's presence in ecclesial institutions, other public institutions, and lay-centered social movements (particularly faith-based community organizing) and via a case study of the healthcare reform debate around the State Children's Health Insurance Program and the Affordable Care Act. Cultural and institutional factors shaping Catholic public presence are analyzed in three dimensions of social life: institutional leadership; authority dynamics within the Church; and the culture of prayer, spirituality, and worship in parishes. Finally, the conclusion discusses the key dynamics likely to shape the future of public Catholicism in America.",117
"Background: Menarche age has been associated inconsistently with the occurrence, timing or severity of major depressive disorder (MDD), but rarely studied in women with bipolar (BDs) or anxiety disorders. Methods: We investigated women patients at a Sardinian mood disorder center for associations of age at menarche with age at illness onset for major affective or anxiety disorders, year of birth, and other selected factors, using bivariate comparisons and multivariate regression modeling. Results: Among women (n = 1139) with DSM-IV MDD (n = 557), BD-I (n = 223), BD-II (n = 178), or anxiety disorders (n = 181), born in 1904-1998, of mean age 42.9 years, menarche age averaged 12.8 [CI: 12.7-12.9] years. Illness onset age averaged 30.9 [30.1-31.8] years, ranking: BD-I, 25.8; anxiety disorders, 28.0; BD-II, 30.3; MDD, 34.1 years. Menarche age declined secularly over birth years, and was associated with younger illness-onset, having no or fewer siblings, more psychiatrically ill first-degree relatives, living in rural environments, being suicidal, substance abuse, and being unemployed. Earlier menarche and earlier illness-onset were significantly associated for onset age groups of40 years. Menarche age versus diagnosis ranked: BD-II < BD-I < anxiety disorders < MOD. Conclusions: Age at menarche in Sardinia, as elsewhere, has declined over the past decades. It was strongly associated with age at onset of bipolar and anxiety, as well as major depressive disorders across the age range, suggesting sustained effects of biological maturational factors.

"Geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) have been widely used as a hydraulic barrier along with HDPE geomembrane (GM) in landfills. Both the internal and interface strengths of GCLs are very important for evaluating landfill stability. An improved simple shear apparatus used in this study does not force the shear failure to occur along a pre-determined plane. The composite specimens can fail along any interface or through shearing of the GCL internally. The displacement of each component of the specimen can also be measured during the tests. When non-woven geotextile side contacts textured GM (NWGT/GMX) and woven geotextile side contacts compacted clay layer (WGT/CCL) for a dry GCL, the failure interface can change from NWGT/GMX interface to WGT/CCL interface with the increases of the normal stresses. Conversely, when woven geotextile side contacts textured GM (WGT/GMX) and non-woven geotextile side contacts compacted clay layer (NWGT/CCL) for a dry GCL, the failure always occurs at the WGT/GMX interface for all applied normal stresses. The internal failure of the GCL did not occur when the normal stress increased up to 1,500 kPa for the GCL in dry condition.",93
"This paper discusses the modeling and control of the ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) actuators which have many promising applications in biomechatronics. A novel mathematical model in continuous-time domain of the IPMC actuator, being a stable second-order dynamical system preceded by a nonlinear hysteresis representation, is proposed. An adaptive controller is formulated for the IPMC actuator based on the proposed model. The proposed adaptive control law ensures the global stability of the controlled IPMC system, and the position error of the IPMC actuator can be theoretically guaranteed to converge to zero. The effectiveness of the proposed model and the superiority of the proposed control to the traditional proportional-integral-derivative control are verified by experimental results.",103
"The fuel economy (FE) of the parallel hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) suffers due to significant energy losses from the wet clutches of the automatic transmission and limited engine operations. To overcome these limitations, a novel clutchless multimode parallel HEV (CMP-HEV) was proposed previously, but its operational feasibility was not proven. In this study, we propose a systematic methodology that can assess the feasibility of the CMP-HEV and efficiently optimize FE and acceleration performance of the design, simultaneously. Using the dynamic models, we assess the feasibility over the entire design spaces under two conditions: full acceleration (for drivability) and moderate acceleration (for fuel efficiency). An instantaneous optimization method is used to rapidly evaluate the full acceleration performance, and the designs with poor acceleration are considered infeasible. For the fuel efficiency, the feasibility is determined by the violation of electric motor constraints under the assumption of efficient engine operations. The feasible design sets from the assessment are used for the design optimization. Dynamic programming is applied over only the feasible design space, and the Pareto front is obtained to show the tradeoff between FE and acceleration performance. The selected final design is found superior to a comparable parallel HEV in both FE and acceleration performance perspectives.",53
"Background: Affective dysregulation is a core feature of bipolar disorder (BD), and inter-episodic affect lability is associated with more severe outcomes including comorbidity. Rates of daily tobacco smoking and substance use disorders in BD are high. Knowledge regarding relationships between affective lability and abuse of the most commonly used substances such as tobacco, alcohol and cannabis in BD is limited. Methods: We investigated whether dimensions of inter-episodic affective lability as measured with the Affective Lability Scale short form (ALS-SF) were associated with lifetime daily tobacco use or alcohol (AUD) or cannabis use disorders (CUD) in a sample of 372 French and Norwegian patients with BD I and II. Results:. ALS-SF total score and all sub-dimensions (anxiety-depression, depression-elation and anger) were significantly associated with AUD, while only the depression-elation sub-dimension was associated with CUD, after controlling for possible confounders such as gender, age at interview, age at illness onset, BD subtype, duration of illness and other substance use disorders. Daily tobacco smoking was not significantly associated with affective lability. Limitations: Data for recent substance use or psychiatric comorbidities such as personality or hyperkinetic disorders were not available, and could have mediated the relationships. Conclusion: AUD is associated with several dimensions of inter-episodic affective lability in BD, while CUD is associated with increased oscillations between depression and elation only. Increased affective lability may partly explain the increased illness severity of patients with BD and AUD or CUD. Affective lability should be treated in order to prevent these comorbidities.",70
"Reliable and accurate short-term subway passenger flow prediction is important for passengers, transit operators, and public agencies. Traditional studies focus on regular demand forecasting and have inherent disadvantages in predicting passenger flows under special events scenarios. These special events may have a disruptive impact on public transportation systems, and should thus be given more attention for proactive management and timely information dissemination. This study proposes a novel multiscale radial basis function (MSRBF) network for forecasting the irregular fluctuation of subway passenger flows. This model is simplified using a matching pursuit orthogonal least squares algorithm through the selection of significant model terms to produce a parsimonious MSRBF model. Combined with transit smart card data, this approach not only exhibits superior predictive performance over prevailing computational intelligence methods for non-regular demand forecasting at least 30 min prior, but also leverages network knowledge to enhance prediction capability and pinpoint vulnerable subway stations for crowd control measures. Three empirical studies with special events in Beijing demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively predict the emergence of passenger flow bursts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"Water pollution is a complex problem as the removal of various pollutants along with microbes need multifunctional materials to make the polluted water potable. Selective removal of highly toxic pollutant such as He ions from wastewaters is an area of critical significance. In this study we report a bi-functional material derived from N-vinylformamide (NVF) that is highly selective and has high adsorption capacity for He ions with qm of 248.76 mg g(-1) and it also acts as an biocidal agent against the representative microorganisms Gram (+), S. epidermidis, Gram (-) S. typhi, bacteria and a fungus C albicans. The effect of different parameters as well as that of the competing ions on He ions adsorption capacity was studied. The material reported in this article represents an important advance over the earlier reported materials. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",96
"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has recently been implicated in leukaemic cell growth, tumour-associated angiogenesis and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We examined whether mTOR plays a role as regulator of growth and VEGF-expression in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Three mTOR-targeting drugs, rapamycin, everolimus (RAD001) and CCI-779, were applied. The effects of these drugs on growth, survival, apoptosis and VEGF expression in primary AML cells and various AML cell lines were examined. Growth of AML cells and AML-derived cell lines was assessed by (3)H-thymidine incorporation, survival was examined by light- and electron microscopy, by Tunel assay and by AnnexinV-staining, and the expression of VEGF by Northern blotting, RT-PCR and ELISA. Rapamycin was found to counteract growth in the AML cell lines U937 and KG1a as well as in primary AML cells in 14/18 patients examined. The effects of rapamycin and its derivatives were dose-dependent (IC(50): 10 pM-100 nM). It was also found that exposure to mTOR-targeting drugs resulted in apoptosis and in decreased expression of VEGF in leukaemic cells. mTOR-targeting drugs exert antileukaemic effects on AML cells in vitro through multiple actions, including direct inhibition of proliferation, induction of apoptosis and suppression of VEGF. Based on this study and other studies, mTOR can be regarded as a potential drug target in AML.",38
"The objectives of the present study were to gather data on the prenatal development of Turkish cats (the Angora and Van cats) and examine the effects of the breed on prenatal development. Three Angora and four Van cats, ranging in age from 3 to 4 years, were used in the present study. Depending on the stage of pregnancy, the gestational sac diameter (GSD), the fetal heart diameter (FHRTD), the fetal abdominal diameter (FAD), the fetal head diameter (FHD), the fetal gastric diameter (FGD), the fetal width of fore (FWFP) and rear footpads (FWRP) were measured by freezing the images of the fetus or fetal structure on the screen. The mean FHRTD value of the Angora cats was significantly (P = 0.033) greater than the corresponding value of the Van cats during the third week of gestation. The Van cats had significantly (P = 0.008) greater mean value of FHD than did the Angora cats during the fifth week of the gestation. There were no significant breed differences between the other fetal measurements. As a result, the prenatal development of the Angora and Van cats were found to be similar. The findings of the present study may also be used as an aid to estimate the gestational age of domestic cats.",75
"A nonlinear dynamic model for a passively cooled small modular reactor (SMR) is developed. The nuclear steam supply system (NSSS) model includes representations for reactor core, steam generator, pressurizer, hot leg riser and downcomers. The reactor core is modeled with the combination of: (1) neutronics, and (2) thermal-hydraulics. For the helical-coil once-through steam generator, a single tube depiction with time-varying boundaries and three regions, i.e., subcooled, boiling, and superheated, is adopted. The pressurizer model is developed based upon the conservation of fluid mass, volume, and energy. Hot leg riser and downcomers are treated as first-order lags. Finally, the NSSS model is incorporated with a turbine model which permits observing the mechanical power. The overall nonlinear system is simulated for typical perturbations, e.g., control rod withdrawal and increase in steam demand. A detailed analysis of the results show that the steady-state values for full power are in good agreement with design data and the model is capable of predicting the dynamics of the SMR.

"Background: Previous research suggests that bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by deficits in cognitive control (CC). Impaired CC has been found in high-risk samples and is associated with the maintenance of BD symptoms. It remains unclear, however, whether BD is characterized by a general deficit in CC or by a deficit that is specifically related to the processing of emotional material. Methods: The sample consisted of 42 remitted bipolar patients and 39 healthy controls (HC). We examined whether BD individuals display impaired CC when confronted with negative as well as positive material using an arithmetic inhibition task that required inhibition of pictorial stimulus material. Results: Whereas both groups showed difficulties in exerting CC over negative material, only BD individuals exhibited deficient CC over positive material. Limitations: Even though we intended the negative and positive pictures in the arithmetic inhibition task to be similarly arousing, participants in the current study rated the negative compared to the positive pictures as more arousing. Conclusions: BD is associated with impaired CC when processing emotional especially positive stimuli even when patients are in remission. Possible implications of this deficit especially for emotion regulation are discussed.",115
"Aims. To determine the prevalence of international normalized ratio (INR) findings outside the normal range in hospital emergency department patients on vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). To identify factors associated with abnormal anticoagulant levels in these patients. Methods. Observational, cross-sectional, multicentric study in 4 hospital emergency departments. We included a convenience sample of patients on VKA treatment for whom INR levels were on record and who had sought emergency care for complications unrelated to anticoagulant treatment. Results. We included 376 patients with a mean (SD) age of 76.8 (10.1) years; 50.3% were women and 86.7% had atrial fibrillation. We found that 60.4% (95% CI, 55.3%-65.2%) had INRs outside the reference range. Multivariate analysis showed that changes in the patients' other long-term medications were independently associated with nontherapeutic INR results (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.02-2.79; P=.035). Conclusions. Over 60% of patients on VKA treatment who come to hospital emergency departments with complaints unrelated to anticoagulant therapy have INR values outside the normal range. Changes in a patient's usual medications are significantly associated with nontherapeutic INR findings.",111

"PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to describe health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in persons with ostomies and to explore influencing factors. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of data from a cross-sectional survey. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Eight hundred twenty-seven persons living with an ostomy were enrolled from 5 provinces and cities in China from October 2010 to November 2012; the final sample comprises 729 individuals who completed data collection. Their mean +/- SD age was 62.59 +/- 12.40 years (range 26-93 years). METHODS: Health-related quality of life was assessed using the Chinese language version of the City of Hope-Quality of Life-Ostomy Questionnaire-Chinese Version. Sociodemographic data, clinical characteristics, self-efficacy, adjustment to an ostomy, social support, and psychological state of patients were measured by a general information questionnaire. We also administered the Stoma Self-Efficacy Scale, Ostomy Adjustment Inventory-Chinese Version, the Social Support Revalued Scale, and Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale. RESULTS: Of the 729 ostomy patients, the overall HRQOL in ostomy patients was in the moderate range (mean score 5.19 +/- 1.29); scores of physical domain, psychological domain, social domain, and spiritual domains also in the moderate range (5.00 +/- 1.73, 5.97 +/- 1.59, 4.86 +/- 2.31, and 4.93 +/- 2.08 respectively). Multivariate analysis found that multiple factors influenced HRQOL in persons with an ostomy; they were gender, religious belief, and marital status, psychological factors depression and anxiety, and specific components related to social support, self-efficacy in ostomy care, and adjustment to an ostomy. CONCLUSION: Health-related quality of life among Chinese patients with fecal ostomies was less than optimal and influenced by multiple demographic and psychosocial factors. Additional research is needed to design strategies to improve HRQOL in this population.",108
"In order to improve azithromycin's antibacterial activity in acidic medium, monomethoxy poly (ethylene glycol)-block-poly (aspartic acid-graft-imidazole) copolymer was synthesized through allylation, free radical addition, ring-opening polymerization and amidation reactions with methoxy poly (ethylene glycol) as raw material. Drug loading capacity and encapsulation efficiency of azithromycin-loaded micelles prepared via thin film hydration method were 11.58 +/- 0.86% and 96.0 +/- 1.93%, respectively. The drug loaded micelles showed pH-dependent property in the respects of particle size, zeta potential at the range of pH 5.5-7.8. It could control drug in vitro release and demonstrate higher release rate at pH 6.0 than that at pH 7.4. In vitro antibacterial experiment indicated that the activity of azithromycin-loaded micelles against S. aureus was superior to free azithromycin in medium at both pH 6.0 and pH 7.4. Using fluorescein as substitute with pH-dependent fluorescence decrease property, laser confocal fluorescence microscopy analysis confirmed that cellular uptake of micelles was improved due to protonation of copolymer's imidazole groups at pH 6.0. The enhanced cellular uptake and release of drug caused its activity enhancement in acidic medium when compared with free drug. The micellar drug delivery system should be potential application in the field of bacterial infection treatment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",14
"Finding meaning in life is a fundamental personal need, and motivating prosocial behavior is a fundamental societal need. The present research tests whether the two are connected - whether helping other people can increase helpers' perceptions of meaning in life. Evidence from a nationally representative data-set and two experiments support this hypothesis. Participants who engaged in prosocial behaviors - volunteering and spending money to benefit others - reported experiencing greater meaning in their lives (Studies 1-3). Study 3 also identifies increased self-worth as the mechanism - participants who spent money to benefit other people felt higher personal worth and self-esteem, and this mediated the effect of prosocial behavior on meaningfulness. The present results join other findings in suggesting that the incentives for helping others do not necessarily depend on the prospect of others' reciprocity. Prosocial behavior can be incentivized through the psychological benefits it creates for prosocial actors.",65
"Mindful construal diaries were found to assist in weight regulation during a long-term intervention. The current study attempted to expand previous findings by testing the consideration (or priming) of questions within the diary (instead of filling in the answers), and investigated levels of state mindfulness, state self-compassion, and state anxiety in an observational trial of pre- to postintervention. Forty-five participants completed State Mindfulness, State Self-Compassion, and State Anxiety scales before and after their meal and were asked to read and consider the mindful concrete construal diary questions. The results illustrate that state mindfulness, state self-compassion, and state anxiety levels were significantly improved (i.e., increased mindfulness and self-compassion, and decreased anxiety) after participation. Findings provide further evidence as to why the diaries might work in supporting weight regulation, and suggest another method of making eating more mindful. Current findings, limitations, and recommendations for future research are discussed.",121
"Background: Many studies have shown that the transition to college can have a negative effect on students' life style choices resulting in weight gain, increasing inactivity and stress. Additionally while this issue is well recognised there have been only limited attempts at targeted interventions aimed at the university student population. The establishment of poor behavioural choices at this stage in the student's life can lead to consistency of unhealthy lifestyle practices, ultimately placing students at risk of heart disease and other lifestyle related health issues. This is more problematic for nursing students who are identified within the public domain as health promoters and as such ought to model, or at least not grossly contradict, healthy lifestyle choices. The current intervention is proposed as a possible mechanism to interrupt this process and establish healthy lifestyle choices at this crucial time in students' life in the hope that this will have lifelong health benefits. Aim: This is an innovative study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a health and well being module on nursing students' health. Methods: Teaching on Health and Well-Being, a new course in the University, was provided to all first year undergraduate students at one university site in the Republic of Ireland (ROI) (n = 110). Approximately half the sample (Nursing students) underwent an intervention while the other half served as a comparison group, health behaviours of both groups were compared using pre and post-test measures. Findings: The most important finding from the study was a statistically significant increase in psychological wellbeing in the intervention group with a corresponding decrease in psychological well-being in the comparison group. Findings also indicated an initial significant increase in physical activity in the intervention group although this was not maintained over time. Discussion: Targeted health behavioural interventions that include stress management skills ought to be provided as mandatory to nursing students to ensure the health of our future professionals. Only in this way they can role model the behaviours required of clients in their care. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",29
"Background: Inconsistent staffing (high turnover, casual workforce) is problematic in organisations, with the potential to impact both staff and services provided. Research has primarily focused on the impacts of inconsistent staffing in child welfare and community services with little evidence surrounding their ability to impact the outcomes for children with Autism Spectrum Disorders attending early-intervention services. Aim: The aim of this study was to explore staff views regarding the impact of staff turnover on the delivery of group based early intervention for children with ASD. Methods and procedures: We conducted five focus groups involving 29 professional (e.g. teachers, behaviour therapists), para-professional (e.g. child care workers), and managerial staff to explore their views. Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim for use in thematic analysis. Outcomes and results: Two central themes, comprising five categories emerged to encompass participants' views. ""Impacts on Staff"" accounted for the challenges existing staff felt when working with new and untrained staff in the centre. Participants also expressed concerns for the ""Impacts on Service Delivery"" that resulted from dynamic staffing, affecting fidelity of interventions and the program itself. Conclusions and implications: The findings suggest that lacking a consistent staffing structure is problematic when attempting to provide high quality early intervention services to children with ASD and suggest that future research should investigate the extent of inconsistent staffing, impacts of inconsistent staffing on providing intervention, and develop a range of tools to help measure these effects.

"Structural monitoring systems are an objective and quantitative-based management tool that have been developed to assist structure owners with their diagnostic and prognostic decision making processes. As sensing technologies mature, the deployment of permanent sensing arrays in structures is becoming more popular, resulting in increasing volumes of sensing data. Comprehensive data-management systems are needed to host and curate heterogeneous data sets associated with structural asset management including structural information (design and inspection information) and massive amounts of sensing data. More importantly, the data-management system must also provide a functional but secure means of allowing software clients to perform analytics on the data contained in the system. In this paper, a scalable and secure cyberinfrastructure platform termed SenStore is introduced for the management and automated analysis of sensing data. SenStore includes a hybrid database architecture that maximizes query speed by storing structural metadata in a relational database, sensor data in a hierarchical data format repository, and multimedia files such as inspector photos in a flat file system. The design of SenStore is presented, followed by description of its application to manage and process data associated with a long-term wireless monitoring system installed on the Telegraph Road Bridge (Monroe, Michigan). To illustrate the effectiveness of SenStore in tracking the performance of monitored bridges, this study automates the process of extracting modal data from the Telegraph Road Bridge sensor data stored in SenStore and using modal parameters to update a finite-element model that is integral to the bridge owner's decision-making processes.

"The pseudotumor cerebri syndrome (PTCS), also known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), is characterized by signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure such as headache and cranial nerve palsies, in the absence of any space-occupying mass. This condition commonly affects overweight women of childbearing age, even if it is also frequent in men and children. Children with PTCS may present with atypical signs and symptoms, with a different prognosis compared to adults. However, the treatment is the same for both children and adults, even if there are no strict treatment guidelines in regards. All treatment strategies in children are based on retrospective studies and none has been evaluated in prospective or randomized controlled trial studies. This review focuses on literature data on PTCS treatment in children.",127
"In a Sidonian sarcophagus, from the Late Antique/early Christian period, skeletal remains of two persons were found. One of them, male, 30-50 years old, was found almost completely ankylosed, with highly osteoporotic bones and prominent erosion of joint surfaces. We diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis based on the eroded odontoid process, mandibular condyles, distal humerus, proximal and distal ulna, as well ankylosed hand and foot bones. Despite the fact that ankyloses of vertebrae and sacroiliac joint could point towards ankylosing spondylitis, the lack of typical vertebral ankyloses and new bone formation led to exclusion. In a practical sense, due to the advanced stage of the disease, the man was fixed in the supine position, on the left, with his head turned to the right. Apparently, he could not move and had problems with chewing and breathing. But, the high standard of provided healthcare probably enabled him to survive in advanced stages of the disease. This case shed light on the antiquity of the disease, its medical, and social context and provided the example of most extreme osteological changes reported in the paleopathological and medical literature.",107
"An analysis is reported here for three-time level integration methods following the global spectral analysis (GSA) described in High Accuracy Computing Methods, T.K. Sengupta, Cambridge Univ. Press, USA. The focus is on the second order Adams-Bashforth (AB2) and the extrapolation in time (EXT2) methods. Careful distinction is made for the first time step at t = 0 by either Euler forward or four-stage, fourth order Runge-Kutta (RK4) time schemes. The latter is used to solve a benchmark aeroacoustic problem. Several one-dimensional wave propagation models are analyzed: pure advection and advection-diffUsion equations. Various spatial discretizations are discussed, including Fourier spectral method. Attention is paid to the presence of physical and numerical modes as noted in the quadratic equation obtained from the difference equation for the model 1D convection equation. It is shown that AB2 method is less stable and accurate than EXT2 method, with respect to numerical dissipation and dispersion. This is true for the methods, in which the physical mode dominates over the numerical mode. Presented analysis provides useful guide to analyze any three-time level methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

"Lymphocytes respond to a variety of stimuli by activating intracellular signaling pathways, which in turn leads to rapid cellular proliferation, migration and differentiation, and cytokine production. All of these events are tightly linked to the energy status of the cell, and therefore studying the energy-producing pathways may give clues about the overall functionality of these cells. The extracellular flux analyzer is a commonly used device for evaluating the performance of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration in many cell types. This system has been used to study immune cells in a few published reports, yet a comprehensive protocol optimized particularly for lymphocytes is lacking. Lymphocytes are fragile cells that survive poorly in ex vivo conditions. Oftentimes lymphocyte subsets are rare, and working with low cell numbers is inevitable. Thus, an experimental strategy that addresses these difficulties is required. Here, we provide a protocol that allows for rapid isolation of viable lymphocytes from lymphoid tissues, and for the analysis of their metabolic states in the extracellular flux analyzer. Furthermore, we provide results of experiments in which the metabolic activities of several lymphocyte subtypes at different cell densities were compared. These observations suggest that our protocol can be used to achieve consistent, well-standardized results even at low cell concentrations, and thus it may have broad applications in future studies focusing on the characterization of metabolic events in immune cells.",33
"BACKGROUND: More women are using Veterans' Health Administration (VHA) Emergency Departments (EDs), yet VHA ED capacities to meet the needs of women are unknown. OBJECTIVE: We assessed VHA ED resources and processes for conditions specific to, or more common in, women Veterans. DESIGN/SUBJECTS: Cross-sectional questionnaire of the census of VHA ED directors MAIN MEASURES: Resources and processes in place for gynecologic, obstetric, sexual assault and mental health care, as well as patient privacy features, stratified by ED characteristics. KEY RESULTS: All 120 VHA EDs completed the questionnaire. Approximately nine out of ten EDs reported having gynecologic examination tables within their EDs, 24/7 access to specula, and Gonorrhea/Chlamydia DNA probes. All EDs reported 24/7 access to pregnancy testing. Fewer than two-fifths of EDs reported having radiologist review of pelvic ultrasound images available 24/7; one-third reported having emergent consultations from gynecologists available 24/7. Written transfer policies specific to gynecologic and obstetric emergencies were reported as available in fewer than half of EDs. Most EDs reported having emergency contraception 24/7; however, only approximately half reported having Rho(D) Immunoglobulin available 24/7. Templated triage notes and standing orders relevant to gynecologic conditions were reported as uncommon. Consistent with VHA policy, most EDs reported obtaining care for victims of sexual assault by transferring them to another institution. Most EDs reported having some access to private medical and mental health rooms. Resources and processes were found to be more available in EDs with more encounters by women, more ED staffed beds, and that were located in more complex facilities in metropolitan areas. CONCLUSIONS: Although most VHA EDs have resources and processes needed for delivering emergency care to women Veterans, some gaps exist. Studies in non-VA EDs are required for comparison. Creative solutions are needed to ensure that women presenting to VHA EDs receive efficient, timely, and consistently high-quality care. (C) Society of General Internal Medicine 2013",124
"Aluminum is one of the most toxic metals causing a variety of neurologic diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease. It is impossible to avoid contact with aluminum because of its existence in food to medications. Therefore, removal of aluminum from the blood or wastewater is urgently important. The cost-effective and easy-to-prepare adsorbents are needed to get efficient aluminum removal. For that purpose, the poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate-co-acrylic acid), poly(HEMA-co-AA), microparticles was synthesized to remove aluminum in a very short interaction time. The achievement of the desired polymeric structure was confirmed via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM), etc. Additionally, particle features such as swelling ratio, size, and surface area were determined. The microparticles synthesized in this study have been determined with very good adsorption capacity even in small aluminum concentrations.",106
"Three-dimensional symmetric tensor fields have a wide range of applications in solid and fluid mechanics. Recent advances in the (topological) analysis of 3D symmetric tensor fields focus on degenerate tensors which form curves. In this paper, we introduce a number of feature surfaces, such as neutral surfaces and traceless surfaces, into tensor field analysis, based on the notion of eigenvalue manifold. Neutral surfaces are the boundary between linear tensors and planar tensors, and the traceless surfaces are the boundary between tensors of positive traces and those of negative traces. Degenerate curves, neutral surfaces, and traceless surfaces together form a partition of the eigenvalue manifold, which provides a more complete tensor field analysis than degenerate curves alone. We also extract and visualize the isosurfaces of tensor modes, tensor isotropy, and tensor magnitude, which we have found useful for domain applications in fluid and solid mechanics. Extracting neutral and traceless surfaces using the Marching Tetrahedra method can cause the loss of geometric and topological details, which can lead to false physical interpretation. To robustly extract neutral surfaces and traceless surfaces, we develop a polynomial description of them which enables us to borrow techniques from algebraic surface extraction, a topic well-researched by the computer-aided design (CAD) community as well as the algebraic geometry community. In addition, we adapt the surface extraction technique, called A-patches, to improve the speed of finding degenerate curves. Finally, we apply our analysis to data from solid and fluid mechanics as well as scalar field analysis.",86
"A next generation B factory and the detector counterpart, SuperKEKB and Belle II, are being built in Japan, as the upgrades of KEKB and Belle, respectively. The new collider will start its commissioning in 2015. This is an ambitious project. The luminosity of the e(+) e(-) collider will be upgraded by a factor of 40, which will create a 50 times larger data set compared to the Belle sample. Both the background and the triggered event rates will be increased by a factor of at least 10. The Belle II software system is designed to accommodate these challenges and to run on grid, cloud, and local resources around the world. Various external software packages are employed to enhance the user interface. The software system, basf2, is structured as a framework built with dynamic module loading and the ability of parallel processing. The system is written in C++ with Python steering scripts, compatible with common Linux operating systems. A full detector simulation library is created based on Geant4. In this paper, we will explain the design of the Belle II software structure and the current status of the software development.",68
"The uses of technology-delivered mental health treatment options, such as interventions delivered via computer, smart phone, or other communication or information devices, as opposed to primarily face-to-face interventions, are proliferating. However, the literature is unclear about their effectiveness as preventive interventions for higher education students, a population for whom technology-delivered interventions (TDIs) might be particularly fitting and beneficial. This meta-analytic review examines technological mental health prevention programs targeting higher education students either without any presenting problems (universal prevention) or with mild to moderate subclinical problems (indicated prevention). A systematic literature search identified 22 universal and 26 indicated controlled interventions, both published and unpublished, involving 4763 college, graduate, or professional students. As hypothesized, the overall mean effect sizes (ESs) for both universal (0.19) and indicated interventions (0.37) were statistically significant and differed significantly from each other favoring indicated interventions. Skill-training interventions, both universal (0.21) and indicated (0.31), were significant, whereas non-skill-training interventions were only significant among indicated (0.25) programs. For indicated interventions, better outcomes were obtained in those cases in which participants had access to support during the course of the intervention, either in person or through technology (e.g., email, online contact). The positive findings for both universal and indicated prevention are qualified by limitations of the current literature. To improve experimental rigor, future research should provide detailed information on the level of achieved implementation, describe participant characteristics and intervention content, explore the impact of potential moderators and mechanisms of success, collect post-intervention and follow-up data regardless of intervention completion, and use analysis strategies that allow for inclusion of cases with partially missing data.",29
"Flavonoids represent a large class of secondary metabolites produced by plants. These polyphenolic compounds are well known for their antioxidative abilities, are antimicrobial phytoalexins responsible for flower pigmentation to attract pollinators and, in addition to other properties, are also specific bacterial regulators governing the expression of Rhizobium genes involved in root nodulation (Firmin et al., 1986). The bacterial chalcone isomerase (CHI) from Eubacterium ramulus catalyses the first step in a flavanone-degradation pathway by ring opening of (2S)-naringenin to form naringenin chalcone. The structural biology and enzymology of plant CHIs have been well documented, whereas the existence of bacterial CHIs has only recently been elucidated. This first determination of the structure of a bacterial CHI provides detailed structural insights into the key step of the flavonoid-degradation pathway. The active site could be confirmed by co-crystallization with the substrate (2S)-naringenin. The stereochemistry of the proposed mechanism of the isomerase reaction was verified by specific H-1/H-2 isotope exchange observed by H-1 NMR experiments and was further supported by mutagenesis studies. The active site is shielded by a flexible lid, the varying structure of which could be modelled in different states of the catalytic cycle using small-angle X-ray scattering data together with the crystallographic structures. Comparison of bacterial CHI with the plant enzyme from Medicago sativa reveals that they have unrelated folds, suggesting that the enzyme activity evolved convergently from different ancestor proteins. Despite the lack of any functional relationship, the tertiary structure of the bacterial CHI shows similarities to the ferredoxin-like fold of a chlorite dismutase and the stress-related protein SP1.",36
"Background: The allermix survey was conducted to gain insights into the most frequently diagnosed allergies worldwide, the use of allergen immunotherapy (AIT) in clinical practice, and to identify current clinical approaches for the management of polyallergic patients.Methods: The survey was conducted in 19 countries worldwide during 2016. Clinicians currently prescribing AIT completed an online questionnaire, designed to gather data on their daily clinical practice, most commonly diagnosed and treated allergies among their patients, awareness and adherence to recommendations and guidelines on AIT, the AIT format(s) that they choose to prescribe, and management of polyallergic patients.Results: Respondents (N=1029) considered a clinical demonstration of safety and effectiveness, and quality and standardization of allergen extract, as key factors influencing their choice of which AIT formulation to prescribe. 98% of respondents reported managing polyallergic patients; 58% were treated with single-allergen AIT and 42% with multiple-allergen AIT. 74% of respondents were aware of latest AIT practice guidelines, while 67% had an awareness of recent recommendations for pharmaceutical manufacturers.Conclusion: These findings highlight the need for high-quality AIT products that are supported by robust efficacy and safety data, and address the treatment habits of allergy specialists in their real-life clinical practice.",105
"We conducted a multicenter, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of a population-based patient-centered post-fracture care program with a dedicated case manager, PREVention of OSTeoporosis (PREVOST), on appropriate post-fracture osteoporosis management. We showed that, compared to usual care, BMD investigation post-fracture was significantly improved (+20%) by our intervention program. Our study aims to evaluate the impact of a population-based patient-centered post-fracture care program, PREVOST, on appropriate post-fracture care. Multicenter, randomized controlled trial enrolling 436 women aged 50 to 85 years and attending a French hospital, for a low-energy fracture of the wrist or humerus. Randomization was stratified by age, hospital department, and site of fracture. The intervention was performed by a trained case manager who interacted only with the patients, with repeated oral and written information about fragility fractures and osteoporosis management, and prompting them to visit their primary care physicians. Control group received usual care. The primary outcome was the initiation of an appropriate post-fracture care defined by Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and/or anti-osteoporotic treatment prescription at 6 months. At 6 months, 53% of women in intervention group initiated a post-fracture care versus 33% for usual care (adjOR 2.35, 95%CI [1.58-3.50], p < 0.001). Post-fracture care was more frequent after wrist than humerus fracture (adjOR 1.93, 95%CI [1.14-3.30], p = 0.015) and decreased with age (adjOR for 10 years increase 0.76, 95%CI [0.61-0.96], p = 0.02). The intervention resulted in BMD prescription in 50% of patients (adjOR 2.10, 95%CI [1.41-3.11], p < 0.001) and in BMD performance in 41% of patients (adjOR 2.12, 95%CI [1.40-3.20], p < 0.001) versus 33 and 25% for usual care, respectively. Having performed a BMD increased treatment prescription; however, only 46% of women with a low BMD requiring a treatment according to the French guidelines received a prescription. A patient-centered care program with a dedicated case manager can significantly improve post-fracture BMD investigation.",16
"although the tendency towards a Semantic Web is increasing, the current Web is keen on more semantic data. There are several web application domains which need to present their data in the form of graphs to get information and knowledge to allow semantic web searching to deal with them. These domains can be for example geographic data, data in the area of bioinformatics, social networks or even corporate search engines. Most of these domains already store their data in relational database management systems which are not capable of being queried directly by semantic web applications. In this paper we will propose a semi-automated method to map the data from relational databases to RDF structures. This is true for both a single source database as well as different source databases. The results show a complexity of order n(2) where n is the number of records processed, when it comes to the performance in creating the output from mapping the relational database to RDF files.",112
"Background Metformin decreases serum levels of monomeric prolactin. No previous study has investigated the effect of metformin on macroprolactin content in patients with macroprolactinemia. Methods We studied three age-, sex- and weight-matched groups of patients: 15 women with monomeric prolactin, 12 women with macroprolactin, as well as 15 women with normal prolactin levels. Because of coexisting 2 diabetes or prediabetes all patients were treated with metformin (1.7-3 g daily). Plasma lipids, glucose homeostasis markers, as well as serum levels of prolactin and macroprolactin were assessed at baseline and after 4 months of metformin treatment. Results As expected, metformin reduced plasma glucose and triglycerides, as well as improved insulin sensitivity in all treatment groups. Moreover, the drug reduced post-polyethylene glycol prolactin levels and tended to reduce pre-polyethylene glycol prolactin levels in women with monomeric prolactin but not in women with macroprolactinemia and women with normal prolactin levels. Conclusion The obtained results indicate that metformin has a negligible effect on macroprolactin levels.",133
"For roughly the past ten years, we have been working on creating and using virtual and remote laboratories for Science and Engineering education, and on providing a number of software tools that facilitate their creation. Virtual laboratories, or simulations, can be used to promote a more active role of students when studying certain phenomena. Remote laboratories add the extra value of using real hardware, typically at a distant location, which shows students the additional issues that appear when using real equipment. These pedagogical benefits are particularly effective if the laboratories are designed to be used using an Interactive Engagement approach. Our work, which received the gift of the collaboration with many other people interested in improving education, in particular in Physics and Control Engineering, has taught us what are the features and software platforms required to create virtual and remote laboratories. We review the lessons learned from the past ten years of successful outcomes and how we apply these lessons to prepare for the integration of computers, tablets, and other mobile devices with platform-independent cloud-based computing and laboratories.

"This paper proposes an effective method of variation of speed in the recirculation pump and consequently ensure optimum range of flow for absorption chillers when it uses the pair LiBr/H2O. These systems operate at subatmospheric pressures, merely for this reason the use of non-invasive flow measurement methods. The need for low power recirculation systems in such devices makes it impossible to adopt three-phase loads on the driven of the pumps. These implications prevented the achievement of advances in these systems, limiting the success of important contributions in the literature. Due this, it was designed an experimental apparatus reproducing the flow conditions which are submitted to absorption chillers with LiBr and developed a device that could changing the low power load speeds. It was implemented in LabVIEW language, a PID controller action system, which allowed tested to the flow control, initially for water and then to the saline LiBr/H2O.",59
"Material flow analysis is an essential engineering task for effective production and requires a large amount of information that is related to products, processes, resources, and plants. Due to the lack of a systematic framework and supporting system between engineers and related manufacturing information resources, many simulation engineers have actually wasted time and cost with redundant tasks for simulation. A P3R-driven modeling and simulation system in PLM is suggested and implemented in this paper. For this purpose, a P3R data structure is defined for simulation-model generation, and a middleware application is developed based on the P3R object-oriented model. Finally, a concurrent material flow analysis system is developed and applied for area and flow analysis. As a case study, the developed methodology and systems of P3R-driven modeling and simulation are practically applied to automotive press shops. Based on the results, the proposed methodology and systems in this paper are very useful in terms of reducing time and cost in material flow analysis via simulations. Also, it is possible to perform more effective engineering tasks such as simulation for material flow analysis via integrated environment, because relevant data for simulation can be extracted from PLM system automatically and that data is compatible with actual or planned shop floor. This will lead to seamless implementation of manufacturing engineering processes with more effective decision making processes. Furthermore, concurrent material flow analysis is possible from the early stages of product development and production. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",84
"Both adolescent and parent psychiatric symptoms are well-established risk factors for adolescent substance use (SU), but the ways that these symptoms interact are not well understood. This study examined the interactive effects of parent and adolescent psychiatric symptoms on adolescent frequency of alcohol and marijuana use, over and above the effects of parental SU. Seventy adolescents presenting to a community mental health center (CMHC) participated. Parent and adolescent psychiatric symptoms were measured with the brief symptom inventory (BSI) and child behavior checklist (CBCL), respectively. Hierarchical regressions revealed different patterns for adolescent alcohol and marijuana use. For alcohol, the BSI parent phobic anxiety subscale predicted increased adolescent use while the parent interpersonal sensitivity subscale predicted decreased use: the effects of these parental symptoms were strongest among adolescents with higher levels of externalizing problems on the CBCL. For marijuana, the BSI parent psychoticism subscale predicted increased adolescent use, whereas paranoid ideation predicted decreased use. Results suggest that adolescent SU treatment and assessment should attend to both adolescent and parent psychiatric symptoms.",125
"Two hypotheses were tested with respect to the germination of Diplolophium marthozianum, an endemic plant species of the copper-cobalt outcrops in Katanga, Democratic Republic of Congo: (1) germination of copper-endemics is limited by fungal infection in the absence of pathogen control and (2) the germination success of this copper-endemic species is copper-dependent. Seed lots of twenty seeds were weighed, soaked in different disinfection treatments and then placed in a germination medium containing four distinct copper concentrations for 30 days. Seed viability was measured at the beginning and at the end of the experiment by a cut test. Final germination percentage (15.2 +/- 8.2%) and seed viability (24.2 +/- 10.3%) were not affected by copper concentration or disinfection treatments. D. marthozianum is able to germinate in a substrate without added copper, despite pervasive fungal infection. However, seed mass had a significant positive effect on seed germination suggesting that selecting the largest seeds may ensure the highest germination success in ex situ conservation programs.",126
"Objectives: to evaluate cannabinoid receptors (CBRs) expression on peripheral immune cells, i.e., blood monocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and NK cells, and their relationship to a wide range of serum cytokine levels in subjects with schizophrenia and controls. Methods: A sample of 55 people with chronic schizophrenia and 48 controls were enrolled in the study. The expression of the cannabinoid receptors CB1R and CB2R was evaluated in peripheral blood leukocytes by flow cytometry. Serum levels of cytokinesichemokines were simultaneously analyzed by cytometric bead array. Results: We found higher expression of cannabinoid receptors on cells of the innate immune system in subjects with schizophrenia when compared with controls. Serum levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, interferon (IFN-y), and (C-X-C motif) ligand 10/interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (CXCL10/ IP10) were decreased, while levels of the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2/monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (CCL2/MCP-1) were increased in the schizophrenia group in comparison with controls. Patients with schizophrenia showed simpler correlation network between cytokines and CBRs expression than controls. Conclusion: Patients with schizophrenia showed increased CBRs expression in cells of the innate immune system and simpler correlation network between cytokines and CBRs expression when compared with controls. These results suggest a defective endocannabinoid system-mediated immunomodulation in patients with schizophrenia. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",72
"BACKGROUND The time of progression towards AIDS can vary greatly among seropositive patients, and may be associated with host genetic variation. The NR1I2 (PXR) gene, a ligand-activated transcription factor, regulates the transcription immune pathway genes and can therefore be targets of viral replication mechanisms influencing time of progression to AIDS. OBJECTIVE To verify the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs3814057, rs6785049, rs7643645, and rs2461817 in the NR1I2 (PXR) gene with progression to AIDS in HIV-1 infected patients. METHODS Blood samples were obtained from 96 HIV-1 positive individuals following informed consent. DNA was isolated and genotyped through real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of SNPs in the NR1I2. Questionnaires on socio-demographic features and behaviors were answered and time of progression to AIDS was estimated based on medical chart analysis. FINDINGS Patients with the GG genotype for rs7643645 were shown to be related with a more rapid disease progression when compared to GA and AA genotypes. This result was maintained by the Multivariate Cox Regression considering sex, ethnicity, and presence of HLA-B*57, HLA-B*27, and CCR5del32 polymorphisms. MAIN CONCLUSIONS Recent studies reported the expression of the nuclear receptors in T-Lymphocytes, suggesting their possible role in the immune response. In addition, nuclear receptors have been shown to inhibit the HIV replication, although no such mechanism has been thoroughly elucidated to date. This is the first time an association between NR1I2 polymorphism and time of progression to AIDS is reported and supports an apparent relationship between the gene in the immune response and identifies another genetic factor influencing AIDS progression.",37
"Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of two extraoral computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) systems, in comparison with conventional techniques, on the marginal fit of monolithic CAD/CAM lithium disilicate ceramic crowns. Study design: This is an in vitro interventional study. Place and duration of study: The study was carried out at the Department of Prosthodontics, School of Dentistry, Prince Sattam Bin Abdul-Aziz University, Saudi Arabia, from December 2015 to April 2016. Methodology: A marginal gap of 60 lithium disilicate crowns was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. In total, 20 pressable lithium disilicate (IPS e.max Press [Ivoclar Vivadent]) ceramic crowns were fabricated using the conventional lost-wax technique as a control group. The experimental all-ceramic crowns were produced based on a scan stone model and milled using two extraoral CAD/CAM systems: the Cerec group was fabricated using the Cerec CAD/CAM system, and the Trios group was fabricated using Trios CAD and milled using Wieland Zenotec CAM. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Scheffe post hoc test were used for statistical comparison of the groups (alpha=0.05). Results: The mean (+/-standard deviation) of the marginal gap of each group was as follows: the Control group was 91.15 (+/-15.35) mu m, the Cerec group was 111.07 (+/-6.33) mu m, and the Trios group was 60.17 (+/-11.09) mu m. One-way ANOVA and the Scheffe post hoc test showed a statistically significant difference in the marginal gap between all groups. Conclusion: It can be concluded from the current study that all-ceramic crowns, fabricated using the CAD/CAM system, show a marginal accuracy that is acceptable in clinical environments. The Trios CAD group displayed the smallest marginal gap.",82
"Hazardous environments such as in industry sector with high chemical usage give high risks to the safety of workers. These risks can be reduced by designing robotic hand that is able to replace human works. For the industry purpose, the robotic hand needs to have a higher performance in accuracy, stability and consistency. However, the current robotic hand in industry is not flexible, which means it cannot be used for different tasks. Therefore, a multipurpose robotic hand was developed. In this paper, the objectives of this research are to design and develop a PID controller for improving the performances of a robotic hand system. The experimental results prove that the PID controller shows good performances with the steady state error less than 0.11 degrees for the input reference, 30 degrees respectively.",59
"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has become a well-accepted medical therapy in the treatment of movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, and is currently under investigation as a treatment for other disorders, including epilepsy. Although DBS is widely used, its therapeutic mechanisms remain poorly understood. Recent research shows that seizures are network-level phenomena, but the incomplete knowledge of neural circuit function has left a gap in our understanding of how disruption at a molecular or cellular level generates epilepsy. In addition, DBS may potentially provide the opportunity to selectively modulate targeted brain regions and related networks. Therefore, a better understanding of the relationship between normal neural networks and epileptogenic networks, as well as the role of DBS in the modulation of neural networks will help us to find the optimal stimulation targets and parameters to achieve a better therapeutic effect. This review will outline the most recent advances in the relationship between normal brain networks and epileptogenic networks, and the modulation of DBS on the excitability of epileptogenic networks. We will then discuss how to optimize DBS stimulation targets and parameters by taking into consideration the concept of network modulation in order to improve treatment of epilepsy in the future.

"Participants were asked to assess their own personality (i.e. Big Five scales), the personality of politicians shown in brief silent video clips, and the probability that they would vote for these politicians. Response surface analyses (RSA) revealed noteworthy effects of self-ratings and observer-ratings of openness, agreeableness, and emotional stability on voting probability. Furthermore, the participants perceived themselves as being more open, more agreeable, more emotionally stable, and more extraverted than the average politician. The study supports previous findings that first impressions affect decision making on important issues. Results also indicate that when only nonverbal information is available people prefer political candidates they perceive as having personality traits they value in themselves. (C) 2014 The Authors.

"Recently, the use of more sustainable forms of transportation such as electric vehicles (EVs) for delivering goods and parcels to customers in urban areas has received more attention from urban planners and private stakeholders. To provide some insights toward the use of EVs, this work develops an optimization framework using portfolio theory, which takes into account the cost and the risks associated with some input parameter uncertainties, for determining an optimal combination of EVs with internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) in urban freight transportation (UFT) over some planning time period. This model can assist an urban freight operator to choose the best investment strategy for introducing new vehicles into its fleet while gaining economic benefits and having positive impacts on the urban environment. When taking into account the risks that are involved, the numerical results show that EVs have the potential to compete with ICEVs in UFT. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",87
"Hybrid electrical vehicles involve two sources of energy, usually gasoline and electricity. The energy management determines the power sharing between the internal combustion engine and the electrical machine (EM). It is highly dependent on the driving cycle (i.e. the use of the vehicle). In this context, the optimal sizing of the EM is determined by: the driving cycle, the power-train characteristics (i.e. ratios and physical limitations e.g. maximum torque available) and the energy management. The key idea of this work is to involve the driving cycle and the environment of the electrical machine in a global multi-objective optimization process taking into account an optimal energy management and an accurate model of the EM based on magnetic circuit equivalent model.",87
"Background: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been confirmed to play an important role in the development and progression of diseases. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory systemic disease and it is hard to be found in early time. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of lncRNA-AK001085 in the diagnosis of AS. Material/Methods: The expression of lncRNA-AK001085 was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR) analysis. The relationship between its expression and clinicopathologic characteristics was also analyzed. Meanwhile the correlation between lncRNA-AK001085 expression and diseases activity indexes was estimated. In addition, the value of it in the diagnosis of AS was explored through establishing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: Serum lncRNA-AK001085 expression was decreased in patients with AS compared with healthy individuals. And its expression was proved to be influenced by ever cigarette smoker, exercise level and occupational activity level. Besides, the correlation of the expression of lncRNA-AK001085 and disease activity indexes (BASDI, ASDAS, ESR, CRP) were all negative, which suggested that the lncRNA-AK001085 was significantly lower in patients with a high disease activity score. It might showed that the expression of lncRNA-AK001085 affected the activity of AS. Conclusions: LncRNA-AK001085 was down-regulated in AS patients and it could be an independent diagnostic indicator.",107
"The South American Atlantic rainforest is a one-of-a-kind ecosystem considered as a biodiversity hotspot; however, in the last decades, it was intensively reduced to 7 % of its original surface. Water resources and water quality are one of the main goods and services this system provides to people. For monitoring and management recommendations, the present study is focused on (1) determining the nutrient content (nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, and phosphate) and physiochemical parameters (temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and total dissolved solids) in surface water from 24 rainforest mountain rivers in Argentina, (2) analyzing the human health risk, (3) assessing the environmental distribution of the determined pollutants, and (4) analyzing water quality indices (WQI(obj) and WQI(min)). In addition, for total coliform bacteria, a dataset was used from literature. Turbidity, total dissolved solids, and nitrite (NO2-) exceeded the guideline value recommended by national or international guidelines in several sampling stations. The spatial distribution pattern was analyzed by Principal Component Analysis and Factor Analysis (PCA/FA) showing well-defined groups of rivers. Both WQI showed good adjustment (R-2 = 0.89) and rated water quality as good or excellent in all sampling sites (WQI >71). Therefore, this study suggests the use of the WQI(min) for monitoring water quality in the region and also the water treatment of coliform, total dissolved solids, and turbidity.",96
"Background: Many studies have indicated that immune dysfunction might be involved in the physiopathology of schizophrenia and aggression. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin (IL)-10 and clinical characteristics, especially aggression, and to explore the potential role of hsCRP and IL-10 as plasma biomarkers of schizophrenia. Methods: Forty-one patients with schizophrenia and forty healthy individuals were enrolled. Psychopathological severity and aggression were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Modified Overt Aggression Scale (MOAS). Plasma concentrations of hsCRP and IL-10 were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: (1) Higher levels of hsCRP (p < 0.001), lower levels of logIL-10 (p < 0.001) and higher ratio of hsCRP to IL-10 (p < 0.001) were observed in the plasma of patients with schizophrenia, compared to healthy controls; (2) ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve analysis revealed that ratio of hsCRP/IL-10 (predictive value: 0.783, p < 0.01; sensitivity: 85.4%; specificity: 67.5%) was more applicable as a biomarker to distinguish patients with schizophrenia from the control group than hsCRP and IL-10 alone (predictive value: 0.718, p < 0.01; 0.275, p < 0.001, respectively); (3) we found positive correlations between hsCRP and the total score and verbal aggression score of MOAS (r = 0.654, p < 0.01; r = 0.678, p < 0.05), and between hsCRP/IL-10 and the total score of MOAS (r = 0.636, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Our results suggest the possible function of hsCRP and IL-10 in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and the possible value of hsCRP/IL-10 as a potential peripheral biomarker of schizophrenia. This finding also suggests a relationship between hsCRP, IL-10 and their ratio with aggression in patients with schizophrenia. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",72
"In this article, the propagation and collision of vector solitons are investigated from the 3-coupled variable-coefficient nonlinear Schrodinger equations, which describe the amplification or attenuation of the pico-second pulses in the inhomogeneous multicomponent optical fibre with different frequencies or polarizations. On the basis of the Lax pair, infinitely-many conservation laws are obtained. Under an integrability constraint among the variable coefficients for the group velocity dispersion (GVD), nonlinearity and fibre gain/loss, and two mixed-type (2-bright-1-dark and 1-bright-2-dark) vector one-and two-soliton solutions are derived via the Hirota method and symbolic computation. Influence of the variable coefficients for the GVD and nonlinearity on the vector soliton amplitudes and velocities is analysed. Through the asymptotic and graphic analysis, bound states and elastic and inelastic collisions between the vector two solitons are investigated: Not only the elastic but also inelastic collision between the 2-bright-1-dark vector two solitons can occur, whereas the collision between the 1-bright-2-dark vector two solitons is always elastic; for the bound states, the GVD and nonlinearity affect their types; with the GVD and nonlinearity being the constants, collision period decreases as the GVD increases but is independent of the nonlinearity.",24
"Electricity load demand estimation has a remarkable impact on the economic policies of power industry and business cycles. Forecasting the movements of load demand provides to know the tendency of the future and can lead to a clear decision in strategic, planning or investments. Besides the ability to know the fluctuations of the future values contributes to the management of daily/weekly and long term operations. This study aims to predict the electricity load demand using a hybrid method that incorporates Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithms. The proposed EMD-SVR method integrates the EMD method to SVR algorithm by using EMD as a denoising step on the training data. Unlike the previous studies, the proposed algorithm is not dependent to a specific Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) for denoising and model learning. Experimental results are conducted on 3 electricity load datasets from different countries and the proposed method is compared with SVR algorithm using different feature vectors as well. It is shown that the proposed algorithm outperforms the SVR and non-feature used denoised-SVR algorithm on electricity load forecasting. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",43

Instead a classical obituary the rich scientific results of Pavel Holba are survived emphasizing his contribution to the underpinning and determination of hyperfree energy and associated definition of novel terms of phtochability and plutability as well as the characterization of equilibrium background of processes and its impact on the kinetic data evaluation. Not less important are his findings on the resolution and impact of heat inertia as an often forgotten effect influential in DTA kinetics which is known since the 1701 Newton cooling law. His attempts to improve the interrelation between thermodynamics and kinetics are underlined.,88
"Although significant improvements have been made in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), there is a substantial subset of high-risk T-cell ALL (T-ALL) patients with relatively poor prognosis. Like in other leukemia types, alterations of the PI3K/mTOR pathway are predominant in ALL which is also responsible for treatment failure and relapse. In this study, we show that relapsed T-ALL patients display an enrichment of the P13K/mTOR pathway. Using a panel of inhibitors targeting multiple components of the PI3K/mTOR pathway, we observed that the dual-specific PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PKI-587 was the most selective inhibitor for T-ALL cells dependent on the PI3K/mTOR pathway. Furthermore, we observed that PKI-587 blocked proliferation and colony formation of T-ALL cell lines. Additionally, PK1-587 selectively abrogated PI3K/mTOR signaling without affecting MAPK signaling both in in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of the PI3K/mTOR pathway using PKI-587 delayed tumor progression, reduced tumor load and enhanced the survival rate in immune-deficient mouse xenograft models without inducing weight loss in the inhibitor treated mice. This preclinical study shows beneficial effects of PICT-587 on T-ALL that warrants further investigation in the clinical setting. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",121
"Background: Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) plays an important role in immune response regulation as a co-inhibitory signal during T cell activation. However, there is little known about the serum autoantibody profile of PD-1 in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a disease characterized by the breakdown of immune tolerance to self-antigens and an excessive production of autoantibodies. Thus, we aim to investigate the serum levels and function of anti-PD-1 in patients with new-onset SLE. Methods: Serum levels of anti-PD-1 IgG and IgM isotypes were detected in new-onset SLE patients (n = 90), rheumatoid arthritis (n = 50), primary Sjogren's syndrome (n = 50), ankylosing spondylitis (n = 25), and healthy controls (HC) (n = 80) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The correlation of anti-PD-1 with clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters of patients with new-onset SLE was analyzed. The effects of purified anti-PD-1 IgG from SLE patients on T cell proliferation were measured using flow cytometry. Results: The data revealed increased levels of anti-PD-1 IgG, but not IgM, especially in new-onset SLE patients, and the positive rate of anti-PD-1 IgG was 30 (33.3%). The level of anti-PD-1 IgG was closely associated with malar rash (OR = 15.773), arthritis (OR = 22.937), serositis (OR = 16.008), hematological (OR = 35.187), renal (OR = 8.306), and neurological involvement (OR = 37.282). Moreover, the serum levels of anti-PD-1 IgG were positively correlated with the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) score (r = 0.296, p = 0.0046) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (r = 0.2446, p = 0.0201). In vitro examination showed that purified anti-PD-1 IgG obtained from SLE patients enhanced T cell proliferation when co-cultured with dendritic cells (DCs). Conclusions: The current study indicates, for the first time, that the serum levels of co-inhibitor autoantibodies against PD-1 are elevated in new-onset SLE patients and are associated with disease activity in SLE. Autoantibodies against PD-1, facilitating T cell proliferation, revealed a new insight into the function of negative regulation signals involved in the pathogenesis of SLE.",107
"Transformation of pokeweed antiviral protein gene (PAP) into plants was shown to improve plant resistance to several viruses or fungi pathogens with no much negative effect on plant growth. The non-virulent defective PAP inhibits only the virus but does not interfere with the host. A non-virulent defective PAP gene (PacPAP) from Phytolacca acinosa was introduced into cucumber successfully by agrobacterium mediated method. Southern blotting and northern blotting analyses indicated that, 5 stable transgenic cucumber lines with PacPAP were obtained and PacPAP showed different expression levels in transgenic plants. The identification of resistances to disease was performed by artificial inoculation of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and Fusarium oxysporum fsp. cucumerinum on T-0 and T-1 transgenic plants. Compared with the non-transgenic susceptible plants, all transgenic plants with PacPAP showed resistance in different degree to CMV and the CMV-resistance of progeny (T-1) from transgenic lines could inherit stably, but the transgenic plants did not resist to Fusarium wilt of cucumber, the PacPAP was not resistant to Fusarium oxysporum fsp. cucumerinum. This work provides a new virus resistant cucumber breeding resource.",38
"Purpose: The goal of this study was to compare the International Prostate Symptom Storage Subscore (IPSS-s) and the over-active bladder symptom score (OABSS) as tools for assessing the symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB). Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted of a sample of 1,341 patients aged 50 years and older with lower urinary tract complaints who had undergone a medical examination at one of several centers. For each patient, we reviewed the International Prostate Symptom Score and the OABSS. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to their IPSS-s result (group 1, score >= 6; group 2, score <6) and into another 2 groups according to their OABSS diagnosis (group 3, OAB patients; group 4, non-OAB patients). We determined whether the OABSS varied to a statistically significant extent between groups 1 and 2. Furthermore, we evaluated the correlation of IPSS-s severity with the OABSS results in group 3, and the OAB diagnosis rate was compared between groups 1 and 2. Results: In groups 1 and 2, the OABSS results were not found to vary to a statistically significant extent (P=0.326). In group 3, no significant correlation was found between IPSS-s severity and the OABSS results (P=0.385). In the prevalence analysis, no statistically significant difference was found among the groups, and the receiver operating characteristic curve showed an area under the curve of 0.474. Conclusions: The results of this cross-sectional analysis suggest that the IPSS-s and the OABSS are not significantly correlated. Although both scores are used to measure OAB symptoms, the simultaneous use of IPSS-s and OABSS is not warranted.",17
"Previous studies predicted European Union attitudes using anti-immigrant attitudes, but without explicitly accounting for attitudes toward different out-groups. We propose that group-specific attitudes independently predict attitudes toward the European Union, but only when the out-group is linked to the European Union issue in question. We additionally argue that realistic or symbolic threat associated with specific out-groups determines whether utilitarian or identity considerations are more important in predicting European Union attitudes. Using a nationally representative Dutch sample (N=2347), we focus on attitudes toward Polish and Muslim immigrants to predict strengthening of European Union integration and Turkey's potential accession and find support for our hypotheses. The findings indicate the need to rethink the relationship between out-group perceptions and European Union attitudes.",61
"Students who have studied in their native language face difficulty in acquiring programming skills through English medium instruction. One solution for this is to create screencasts of live coding along with instructor explanations in the native language. In this paper we examine the impact of screencast based self-paced learning for Hindi medium (native language) students. Our study had three groups - One group had Hindi as the medium of prior instruction, and learned programming through screencasts in Hindi. Another group, also had Hindi as the medium of prior instruction, but learned through screencasts in English. The third group had English as the medium of prior instruction, and learned through screencasts in English. We compared the performance of the three groups using a post-test having items of fact, concept and process content types. We found that Hindi medium students who studied from Hindi screencasts performed as well as English medium students who studied from English screencasts. Both groups performed better than Hindi medium students who studied from English screencasts. The effect of medium of instruction was significant for the content types of fact, process and concept.",40
"Maternal feeding is a frequent intervention target for the prevention of early childhood obesity but longitudinal associations between feeding and child overweight are poorly understood. This observational cohort study sought to examine the cross-lagged associations between maternal feeding and overweight across ages 21, 27, and 33 months. Feeding was measured by maternal self-report (n = 222) at each age. Child weight and length were measured. Cross-lagged analysis was used to evaluate longitudinal associations between feeding and overweight, adjusting for infant birth weight, maternal body mass index, maternal education, and maternal depressive symptoms. The sample was 50.5% white, 52.3% male and 37.8% of mothers had a high school education or less. A total of 30.6%, 29.2%, and 263% of the sample was overweight at each age, respectively. Pressuring to Finish, Restrictive with regard to Amount, Restrictive with regard to Diet Quality, Laissez-Faire with regard to Diet Quality, Responsiveness to Satiety, Indulgent Permissive, Indulgent Coaxing, Indulgent Soothing, and Indulgent Pampering each tracked strongly across toddlerhood. There were no significant associations between maternal feeding and child overweight either in cross-sectional or cross-lagged associations. Our results do not support a strong causal role for feeding in childhood overweight. Future work longitudinal work should consider alternative approaches to conceptualizing feeding and alternative measurement approaches. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",18
"Background Equal access to mainstream healthcare services for people with intellectual disabilities (ID) still requires attention. Although recent studies suggest that health professionals hold positive attitudes towards people with ID, stigmatising attitudes may influence their efforts to serve people with ID in community healthcare practice. To stimulate inclusion in mainstream healthcare services, this systematic review focussed on barriers in attitudes of mainstream health professionals towards people with ID. Method Five electronic databases were systematically searched and references in full text articles were checked for studies published in the English language between January 1994 and January 2016. A social-psychological triad of cognitive, affective and behavioural dimensions of stigmatising attitudes is used to structure and discuss the results. Results The literature search generated 2190 records with 30 studies that passed our exclusion criteria. Studies were mostly cross-sectional and of moderate quality. With respect to stigma, a lack of familiarity with and knowledge about people with ID was found. ID was considered as a stable condition not under personal control. Moreover, mainstream health professionals had either low or high expectations of the capabilities of people with ID. Professionals reported stress, lack of confidence, fear and anxiety, a tendency to treat people with ID differently and a lack of supporting autonomy. Conclusions Stigmatising attitudes towards people with ID appeared to be present among mainstream health professionals. This might affect the ongoing challenges regarding inclusion in mainstream healthcare services. To facilitate inclusion in mainstream healthcare services, it is recommended to include contact and collaboration with experts-by-experience in education programs of health professionals. Future research should progress beyond descriptive accounts of stigma towards exploring relationships between cognitive, affective and behavioural dimensions as pointers for intervention. Finally, inclusion would benefit from an understanding of equal' treatment that means reasonable adjustments instead of undifferentiated treatment.",108
"A tracking controller is proposed for a crane attached to a mobile harbor (MH) equipped with a dual-stage trolley system, to dynamically position a container from the MH to the container ship or vice versa. Wave-induced motions of the MH and container ship occur during loading and unloading operations owing to external disturbances such as waves. However, a challenging task is to move a payload with unwanted swing motions accurately to the loading and unloading positions on a moving target vessel. To solve this problem, a dynamic MH crane model is derived in three-dimensional space, with roll, pitch, and heave motions caused by sea-wave disturbances. The MH crane model is then linearized to design a tracking controller and the parameters of the linearized model are obtained by carrying out the system identification process. A preview tracking control method that includes feedback and feed-forward control with the predicted target position in the x-y plane in the near future is utilized. Through numerical simulations and experiments with a scaled model, the tracking performance of the proposed dynamic positioning control system is considered when sinusoidal roll and pitch motions of the MH are generated to mimic the wavy sea environment.",49
"Background: Struma ovarii (SO) is a rare form of ovarian mature teratoma in which thyroid tissue is the predominant element. Because of its rarity, the differential diagnosis between benign and malignant SO has not been clearly defined. It is believed that malignant transformation of SO has similar molecular features with and its prognosis corresponds to that of malignant tumors originating in the thyroid. Case presentation: We report 35-year-old woman with bilateral ovarian cysts incidentally detected by ultrasound during the first trimester of pregnancy. Four months after delivery of a healthy child without complication she was admitted to the hospital for acute abdominal pain. Laparoscopic left adnexectomy was performed initially in a regional hospital; right cystectomy was done later in a specialized clinic. Intraoperative frozen section and a final pathology revealed that the cyst from the left ovary was composed of mature teratomatous elements, normal thyroid tissue (>50%) and a non-encapsulated focus of follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Normal and cancerous thyroid tissues were tested for BRAF and RAS mutations by direct sequencing, and for RET/PTC rearrangements by RT-PCR/Southern blotting. A KRAS codon 12 mutation, the GGT ->GTT transversion, corresponding to the Gly ->Val amino acid change was identified in the absence of other genetic alterations commonly found in PTC. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this mutation is described in a papillary thyroid carcinoma arising in struma in the ovarii. This finding provides further evidence that even rare mutations specific for PTC may occur in such tumors. Molecular testing may be a useful adjunct to common differential diagnostic methods of thyroid malignancy in SO.",39
"A systematic and generic procedure for the determination of the reasonable finished state of self-anchored suspension bridges is proposed, the realization of which is mainly through adjustment of the hanger tensions. The initial hanger tensions are first obtained through an iterative analysis by combining the girder-tower-only finite element (FE) model with the analytical program for shape finding of the spatial cable system. These initial hanger tensions, together with the corresponding cable coordinates and internal forces, are then included into the FE model of the total bridge system, the nonlinear analysis of which involves the optimization technique. Calculations are repeated until the optimization algorithm converges to the most optimal hanger tensions (i.e. the desired reasonable finished bridge state). The ""temperature rigid arm"" is introduced to offset the unavoidable initial deformations of the girder and tower, which are due to the huge axial forces originated from the main cable. Moreover, by changing the stiffness coefficient K in the girder-tower-only FE model, the stiffness proportion of the main girder, the tower or the cable subsystem in the whole structural system could be adjusted according to the design intentions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is examined and demonstrated by one simple tutorial example and one self-anchored suspension bridge.",97
"Particle filtering (PF) is an eminent simulation-based state estimation technique, which is capable of handling massive data sets and diverse external factors. Here, an effective selection of the importance density plays a pivotal role in performances of PFs by not only preventing degeneracy problems at early stages of process, but also taking both the transition prior and likelihood into account when the likelihood appears in the tail of the prior. To this end, we propose a novel importance density selection scheme for PF based on the minimum relative entropy principle. Theoretical derivation of the proposed scheme is presented, and its effectiveness is evaluated against various sampling schemes that exist in the literature using synthetic experiments. Finally, the performance of the proposed minimum relative entropy-based density selection scheme is successfully demonstrated for short-term electricity demand forecasting of a company located in Miami, FL, USA. Note to Practitioners-This paper was motivated by the necessity of reducing utility costs in terms of energy consumption in large-scale enterprises. Determination of the lowest cost method of providing the required amount of electricity heavily relies on accurate load demand forecast. In addition, demand forecasting problems also exist in various fields, including supply chain management, manufacturing, and microgrid networks. This paper provides an eminent approach to estimate the posterior state (i.e., demand in forthcoming periods) given the prior states (i.e., past demand) and measurements. In this paper, we mathematically derive the method using the minimum relative entropy principle. To validate the proposed method, a series of synthetic experiments are designed, and a case study of short-term electricity demand forecasting is carried out. The results obtained from the proposed method have been benchmarked against those obtained from four other approaches that exist in the literature. In future research, we will extend the application scope of this paper to tracking in naval radar systems and state estimation in distributed power systems with renewables.",43
"This paper presents new approaches regarding the use of Product Lifecycle Management concept to achieve knowledge integration of the academic disciplines in the maritime education context. The philosophy of the educational system is now changing faster worldwide and it is in a continuous developing process. There is a demand to develop modern educational facilities for CAD/CAE/CAM training of the future maritime engineers, which offers collaborative environments between the academic disciplines and the teachers. It is well known that the students must understand the importance of the connectivity between the academic disciplines and the computer aided methods to interface them. Thus, besides the basic knowledge and competences acquired from the CAD courses, students learn how to increase the design productivity, to create a parametric design, the original instruments of automatic design, 3D printing methods, how to interface the CAD/CAE/CAM applications. As an example, the Strength of Materials discipline briefly presents alternate computer aided methods to compute the geometrical characteristics of the cross sections using the CAD geometry, creation the free body diagrams and presentation the deflected shapes of various educational models, including the rotational effect when the forces are not applied in the shear center, using the results of the FEM applications. During the computer aided engineering academic disciplines, after the students design and analyze a virtual 3D model they can convert it into a physical object using 3D printing method. Constanta Maritime University offers a full understanding of the concept of Product Lifecycle Management, collaborative creation, management and dissemination.",91
"The potential power of augmented reality (AR) makes it possible to change the semiotic meaning of the real space, and strongly influence human attitude and behavior for achieving a better lifestyle. Typical AR approaches can simply integrate computer-generated (CG) virtual images on the real space from a spatial aspect. This approach limits the potential power because only some objects in the real space can be enhanced. In contrast, virtual reality (VR) technologies make it possible to create a new fictional, but realistic virtual space by using 3D models of real persons and landscapes. In this paper, we propose a new concept named Alternative Reality that is used for building a new type of ambient intelligence experiences. Alternative Reality makes it possible to connect the real space with the virtual space temporally and to integrate the two spaces seamlessly, where its virtual space consists of real landscapes and persons not fictional ones to change the semiotic meaning of the real space and strongly influence human attitude and behavior. However, the virtual space does not reflect the events that actually happened in the real space; this means that it may be possible to enhance the real space by showing fictional events among real events. For demonstrating the Alternative Reality concept, we have developed a case study named Fictional Future, where the virtual space is constructed with fictional events performed by real persons in real landscapes. We conducted a user study of the case study to show the feasibility of the Alternative Reality concept. The user study shows that Alternative Reality augments the real space effectively and a user still experiences the virtual space as in the real space.",92
"Taken individually, Ground Source Heat (GSH) pervious paving systems (PPS) and rainwater harvesting are not new, but in combination, this energy-water blend is relatively recent. Sealed with impermeable geomembrane, PPS becomes a water harvesting tank and by installing GSH collectors in the base, there is the potential to sustainably heat and cool buildings, provide flood resilience and improve water quality. A review of the literature found that Coefficients of Performance suggest that such systems could be considered viable, reaching the value of 2.875 required by the EU Renewable Energy Directive, 2009. Small-scale laboratory-based test rigs of the combined system were able to reduce pollutants by up to 99% for biological oxygen demand and 95% for ammonia-nitrogen, with rare occurrences of potentially pathogenic bacteria e.g. Legionella, and low survival rates of Escherichia coli. Whilst test rigs provide valuable information, field monitoring at the building scale is the only way to validate the technology. Thus, this paper presents previously unpublished results of monitoring a combined system at the building scale which found that there is clear potential to use a clean, renewable and sustainable source of heat at the same time as providing flood resilience, water quality improvements and some amenity in a domestic setting. However, it was also found that seasonal changes and building use affected levels of comfort achievable. Lessons were learnt, such as construction strategies to optimise design, including depth of the heat collectors and the optimal surface area of the PPS available to infiltrate water.

"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a maturity model developed to assess knowledge sharing (KS) for the Jordanian construction sector. Design/methodology/approach - The research was conducted in three stages. The first stage consisted of the review of literature and documenting variables from the literature that highlight influence on KS in organizations. The second stage was designed for maturity model development by identifying the cultural factors that affect KS in the Jordanian construction sector through questionnaires and interviews. Factor analysis was used to find possible relationships between the cultural variables followed by semi-structured interviews. In the third stage the initial maturity model was refined through another set of semi-structured interviews. Findings - The model presented in the paper includes three levels of maturity. The first level identifies whether the variable barely exists in company's KS practices. The second level shows the occasional techniques which the company uses to increase KS activities. The final level demonstrates the importance of the variable in affecting KS as being fundamentally ingrained in the company's vision, mission, strategy and operations. Originality/value - The research has developed a model that can be used to measure the KS in an organization. Although the model has been applied to the construction industry, it can easily be modified to fit in the other sectors.",102
"Sentinel-1 is the first of a family of satellites designed to provide a data stream for the European environmental monitoring program known as Copernicus. Sentinel-1 constellation has been specifically designed to perform, over land, advanced Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) analyses for the investigation of Earth's surface displacements. In particular, owning to its 6-day revisit time and its innovative acquisition mode, which is referred to as Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS) and is fundamental for guaranteeing a global spatial coverage, Sentinel-1 constellation is contributing to the creation of a framework for the exploitation of ""Big Data"" for Earth Observation (EO) applications. In this paper, we present an efficient and automatic implementation of the Parallel Small BAseline Subset (P-SBAS) DInSAR algorithm, specifically intended for the processing of Sentinel-1 SAR data. The algorithm is able to run on distributed computing infrastructures by effectively exploiting a large number of resources, and allows the generation of ground displacement time-series. The aim of this paper is to show that it is possible to automatically and continuously process, in a short time frame, very large sequences of Sentinel-1 data, thus allowing us to perform advanced interferometric analyses at an unprecedented large scale. In addition, the proposed Sentinel-1 P-SBAS algorithm has also been tested on commercial public cloud computing platforms, such as those provided by the Amazon Web Services. The presented Sentinel-1 P-SBAS processing chain is well suited to build up operational services for the easy and rapid generation of advanced interferometric products, which can be very useful not only for scientific purposes but also for the risk management and the natural hazard monitoring.

"Background: Electrocardiographic (ECG) monitored outpatient cardiac rehabilitation (OP-CR) is routinely performed following a variety of cardiovascular procedures and conditions. Objective: The aim of this study is to determine if diagnostic-quality ECG monitoring in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) during OP-CR is useful in identifying asymptomatic myocardial ischemia, resulting in change(s) in care or medical management. Methods: A retrospective analysis of ECG monitoring was done on all OP-CR patients diagnosed with CAD (n = 1213) from January 2000 through June 2013. Results: Nearly a quarter of the patients (24%; n = 288) displayed at least 1 mm of asymptomatic ST-segment depression at 80 milliseconds after the J-point during at least 1 session of OP-CR. Of these patients, 57% had medical management change(s) compared with 24% for those who did not show ECG changes suggesting ischemia (P < .0001). In patients with asymptomatic ischemia having medical management change(s), 84% resulted directly from OP-CR staff detection. Fewer patients diagnosed with myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass graft surgery demonstrated ECG signs of ischemia, whereas more patients diagnosed with stable angina and percutaneous coronary interventions demonstrated ECG signs of ischemia. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that most patients with CAD showing asymptomatic ECG signs suggesting ischemia undergo medical management change(s) as a result of the finding. Diagnostic-quality ECG monitoring during OP-CR appears warranted in this population.",69
"As a stressful environment in families, mothers' depressive symptoms might increase children's risks of developing behavioral problems by exacerbating genetic influences. Using data from the nationally representative Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort data of approximately 750 pairs of twins, we examined whether genetic influences on preschoolers' behavioral problems depended upon mothers' depressive symptoms. Results indicated that the genetic etiology for both internalizing and externalizing behaviors varied with maternal depressive symptoms at 9-months child age. Genetic effects on externalizing behaviors increased as mothers' depressive symptoms increased; however, genetics effects on internalizing behaviors increased when depressive symptoms either increased or decreased from the median level. These different patterns of interactive effects suggest potentially different mechanisms for the etiology of children's externalizing and internalizing behaviors.",69
"We investigated whether attachment quality is related to infant-mother dyadic patterns in monitoring animated social situations. Sixty 12-month-old infants and their mothers participated in an eye-tracking study in which they watched abstractly depicted distress interactions involving the separation of a baby and a parent character followed by reunion or further separation of the two characters. We measured infants' and their mothers' relative fixation duration to the two characters in the animations. We found that infant attachment disorganization moderated the correspondence between the monitoring patterns of infant-mother dyads during the final part of the animations resulting in reunion or separation. Organized infants and their mothers showed complementary monitoring patterns: the more the mothers focused their attention on the baby character, the more the infants focused their attention on the parent character, and vice versa. Disorganized infant-mother dyads showed the opposite pattern although the correlation was nonsignificant: mothers and their infants focused on the same character. The attachment-related differences in the nature of the synchrony in the attentional processes of infants and their mothers suggest that by 12months the dyads' representations of social situations reflect their shared social-emotional experiences.",80
"For years, conventional wisdom has held that patients with asymptomatic ventricular pre-excitation (asymptomatic WPW or WPW pattern) were at low risk for adverse outcomes. This assumption has been challenged more recently in a number of observational/natural history studies as well as in prospective trials in which patients were more aggressively studied via invasive electrophysiology study (EPS) and more aggressively treated, in some cases, with pre-emptive catheter ablation, despite the lack of symptoms. In sum, the data do not definitively support one approach (early, up-stream EPS and/or ablation) vs. the other (watchful waiting with close monitoring). The most recent pediatric and adult guidelines reflect this ambiguity with a broad spectrum of approaches endorsed.",111
"Web news articles are generated in continuous, time-varying, and rapid modes. This environment causes an explosion of information which needs to be stored, processed and analyzed. Conventional machine learning algorithms that are applied in the web news mining work in an offline environment cannot efficiently handle data streams. In this paper, we propose an evolving web news mining framework based on the recently published Evolving Type-2 Classifier (eT2Class). The eT2Class adopts an open structure that can be used in non stationary environments and works on a single pass learning mode that is applicable for online real-time applications. The effectiveness of our evolving web news mining techniques is numerically validated and compared against state-of-the-art algorithms. The efficacy of our methodology has been numerically validated with real local Australian news articles, namely the Age, spanning from 26/2/2016 to 13/3/2016 and has been compared with 6 state of the art algorithms. Our algorithm outperforms other consolidated algorithms and achieves a tradeoff between complexity and accuracy with almost 10% improvement in term of complexity.

"Changes in the expression of hepatocyte membrane transporters in advanced fibrosis decrease the hepatic transport function of organic anions. The aim of our study was to assess if these changes can be evaluated with pharmacokinetic analysis of the hepatobiliary transport of the MR contrast agent gadoxetate. Dynamic gadoxetate-enhanced MRI was performed in 17 rats with advanced fibrosis and 8 normal rats. After deconvolution, hepatocyte three-compartmental analysis was performed to calculate the hepatocyte influx, biliary efflux and sinusoidal backflux rates. The expression of Oatp1a1, Mrp2 and Mrp3 organic anion membrane transporters was assessed with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In the rats with advanced fibrosis, the influx and efflux rates of gadoxetate decreased and the backflux rate increased significantly (p = 0.003, 0.041 and 0.010, respectively). Significant correlations were found between influx and Oatp1a1 expression (r = 0.78, p < 0.001), biliary efflux and Mrp2 (r = 0.50, p = 0.016) and sinusoidal backflux and Mrp3 (r = 0.61, p = 0.002). These results show that changes in the bidirectional organic anion hepatocyte transport function in rats with advanced liver fibrosis can be assessed with compartmental analysis of gadoxetate-enhanced MRI. aEuro cent Expression of hepatocyte transporters is modified in rats with advanced liver fibrosis. aEuro cent Kinetic parameters at gadoxetate-enhanced MRI are correlated with hepatocyte transporter expression. aEuro cent Hepatocyte transport function can be assessed with compartmental analysis of gadoxetate-enhanced MRI. aEuro cent Compartmental analysis of gadoxetate-enhanced MRI might provide biomarkers in advanced liver fibrosis.",37
"The consideration of worker heterogeneity in assembly lines has received a fair amount of attention in the literature in the past decade. Most of this exploration uses as motivation the example of assembly lines in sheltered work centers for the disabled. Only recently has the community started looking at the situation faced in assembly lines in the general industrial park, when in the presence of worker heterogeneity. This step raises a number of questions around the best way to incorporate heterogeneous workers in the line, maximizing their integration while maintaining productivity levels. In this paper we propose the use of Miltenburg's regularity criterion and cycle time as metrics for integration of workers and productivity, respectively. We then define, model and develop heuristics for a line balancing problem with these two goals. Results obtained through an extensive set of computational experiments indicate that a good planning can obtain trade-off solutions that perform well in both objectives. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"Seven Z-octadecenoic acids having the double bond located in positions 6Z to 13Z were photooxidized. The resulting hydroperoxy-E-octadecenoic acids [HpOME(E)] were resolved by chiral phase-HPLC-MS, and the absolute configurations of the enantiomers were determined by gas chromatographic analysis of diastereoisomeric derivatives. The MS/MS/MS spectra showed characteristic fragments, which were influenced by the distance between the hydroperoxide and carboxyl groups. These fatty acids were then investigated as substrates of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), manganese lipoxygenase (MnLOX), and the (8R)-dioxygenase (8R-DOX) activities of two linoleate diol synthases (LDS) and 10R-DOX. COX-1 and MnLOX abstracted hydrogen at C-11 of (12Z)-18:1 and C-12 of (13Z)-18:1. (11Z)-18:1 was subject to hydrogen abstraction at C-10 by MnLOX and at both allylic positions by COX-1. Both allylic hydrogens of (8Z)-18:1 were also abstracted by 8R-DOX activities of LDS and 10R-DOX, but only the allylic hydrogens close to the carboxyl groups of (11Z)-18:1 and (12Z)-18:1. 8R-DOX also oxidized monoenoic C-14-C-20 fatty acids with double bonds at the (9Z) position, suggesting that the length of the omega end has little influence on positioning for oxygenation. We conclude that COX-1 and MnLOX can readily abstract allylic hydrogens of octadecenoic fatty acids from C-10 to C-12 and 8R-DOX from C-7 and C-12.-Oliw, E. H., A. Wennman, I. Hoffmann, U.

"Psoriasis treatments range from topical treatments and phototherapy to oral systemic medications and injections. Despite good control of the disease when applying appropriate treatments (according to disease severity, insurance parameters, patient preference, and patients' ability to adhere), continued advancements will allow even better symptomatic control, reduced adverse effects, and patient satisfaction. This review aims to assess traditional and new psoriasis treatments and how to apply them in clinical practice. A literature review on psoriasis treatments and clinical applications was performed using PubMed. Mild-to-moderate psoriasis treatments include topicals, localized phototherapy, and newer therapies combining two types of topicals, phototherapy with topicals, and easy-to-use foam and spray vehicles. Moderate-to-severe psoriasis therapies include monotherapy or various combinations of generalized phototherapy, oral treatments, and biologic agents, with new oral and biologic agents on the horizon. Dermatologists and primary care providers share roles in screening for associated comorbidities (including cardiovascular disorders, chronic kidney disease, Crohn disease, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus/insulin resistance, depression, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and psoriatic arthritis), managing patients' treatments, and reevaluating treatment needs as new therapies are approved. Continued advancements in psoriasis treatment and improvement in coordinated care will allow better overall care of patients with psoriasis.",22
"Prion-like propagation of abnormal intracytoplasmic proteins, which are the defining features of major neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), has been proposed. A growing body of evidence strongly suggests that abnormal tau, alpha-synuclein and TDP-43 have prion-like properties, convert the corresponding normal proteins into abnormal forms, and are transmitted from cell to cell, spreading throughout the brain. This idea is extremely important not only for understanding the pathogenesis and progression of these diseases, but also for the development of molecular therapies. Since the distributions and spreading of the abnormal proteins are closely associated with disease symptoms and progression, gain-of-toxic-function of these proteins may affect the neurons and glial cells either directly or indirectly, or both. It is essential to regulate the aggregation of abnormal intracellular proteins and their cell-to-cell transmission in order to stop, or at least slow, the progression of these diseases.

"Whether theory of mind (ToM) is preserved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a controversial subject. Recent studies have showed that performance on some ToM tests might be altered in AD, though to a lesser extent than in behavioural-variant Frontotemporal Dementia (bvFTD). It is however, unclear if this reflects a genuine impairment of ToM or a deficit secondary to the general cognitive decline observed in AD. Aiming to investigate the cognitive determinants of ToM performance in AD, a data-mining study was conducted in 29 AD patients then replicated in an independent age-matched group of 19 AD patients to perform an independent replication of the results. 44 bvFTD patients were included as a comparison group. All patients had an extensive neuropsychological examination. Hierarchical clustering analyses showed that ToM performance clustered with measures of executive functioning (EF) in AD. ToM performance was also specifically correlated with the executive component extracted from a principal component analysis. In a final step, automated linear modelling conducted to determine the predictors of ToM performance showed that 48.8% of ToM performance was significantly predicted by executive measures. Similar findings across analyses were observed in the independent group of AD patients, thereby replicating our results. Conversely, ToM impairments in bvFTD appeared independent of other cognitive impairments. These results suggest that difficulties of AD patients on ToM tests do not reflect a genuine ToM deficit, rather mediated by general (and particularly executive) cognitive decline. They also suggest that EF has a key role in mental state attribution, which support interacting models of ToM functioning. Finally, our study highlights the relevancy of data-mining statistical approaches in clinical and cognitive neurosciences. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",62
"Background: Somatic calreticulin (CALR), Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), and thrombopoietin receptor (MPL) mutations essentially show mutual exclusion in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), suggesting that they activate common oncogenic pathways. Recent data have shown that MPL function is essential for CALR mutant-driven MPN. However, the exact role and the mechanisms of action of CALR mutants have not been fully elucidated. Methods: The murine myeloid cell line 32D and human HL60 cells overexpressing the most frequent CALR type 1 and type 2 frameshift mutants were generated to analyze the first steps of cellular transformation, in the presence and absence of MPL expression. Furthermore, mutant CALR protein stability and secretion were examined using brefeldin A, MG132, spautin-1, and tunicamycin treatment. Results: The present study demonstrates that the expression of endogenous Mpl, CD41, and the key megakaryocytic transcription factor NF-E2 is stimulated by type 1 and type 2 CALR mutants, even in the absence of exogenous MPL. Mutant CALR expressing 32D cells spontaneously acquired cytokine independence, and this was associated with increased Mpl mRNA expression, CD41, and NF-E2 protein as well as constitutive activation of downstream signaling and response to JAK inhibitor treatment. Exogenous expression of MPL led to constitutive activation of STAT3 and 5, ERK1/2, and AKT, cytokine-independent growth, and reduction of apoptosis similar to the effects seen in the spontaneously outgrown cells. We observed low CALR-mutant protein amounts in cellular lysates of stably transduced cells, and this was due to accelerated protein degradation that occurred independently from the ubiquitin-proteasome system as well as autophagy. CALR-mutant degradation was attenuated by MPL expression. Interestingly, we found high levels of mutated CALR and loss of downstream signaling after blockage of the secretory pathway and protein glycosylation. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the potency of CALR mutants to drive expression of megakaryocytic differentiation markers such as NF-E2 and CD41 as well as Mpl. Furthermore, CALR mutants undergo accelerated protein degradation that involves the secretory pathway and/or protein glycosylation.",20
"Established tumors build a stressful and hostile microenvironment that blocks the development of protective innate and adaptive immune responses. Different subsets of immunoregulatory myeloid populations, including dendritic cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and macrophages, accumulate in the stressed tumor milieu and represent a major impediment to the success of various forms of cancer immunotherapy. Specific conditions and factors within tumor masses, including hypoxia, nutrient starvation, low pH, and increased levels of free radicals, provoke a state of ""endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress"" in both malignant cells and infiltrating myeloid cells. In order to cope with ER stress, cancer cells and tumor-associated myeloid cells activate an integrated signaling pathway known as the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), which promotes cell survival and adaptation under adverse environmental conditions. However, the UPR can also induce cell death under unresolved levels of ER stress. Three branches of the UPR have been described, including the activation of the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), the pancreatic ER kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), and the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). In this minireview, we briefly discuss the role of ER stress and specific UPR mediators in tumor development, growth and metastasis. In addition, we describe how sustained ER stress responses operate as key mediators of chronic inflammation and immune suppression within tumors. Finally, we discuss multiple pharmacological approaches that overcome the immunosuppressive effect of the UPR in tumors, and that could potentially enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies by reprogramming the function of tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells.",33
"Change detection is one of the most important applications of remote sensing technology. It is a challenging task due to the obvious variations in the radiometric value of spectral signature and the limited capability of utilizing spectral information. In this paper, an improved sparse coding method for change detection is proposed. The intuition of the proposed method is that unchanged pixels in different images can be well reconstructed by the joint dictionary, which corresponds to knowledge of unchanged pixels, while changed pixels cannot. First, a query image pair is projected onto the joint dictionary to constitute the knowledge of unchanged pixels. Then reconstruction error is obtained to discriminate between the changed and unchanged pixels in the different images. To select the proper thresholds for determining changed regions, an automatic threshold selection strategy is presented by minimizing the reconstruction errors of the changed pixels. Adequate experiments on multispectral data have been tested, and the experimental results compared with the state- of- the- art methods prove the superiority of the proposed method. Contributions of the proposed method can be summarized as follows: 1) joint dictionary learning is proposed to explore the intrinsic information of different images for change detection. In this case, change detection can be transformed as a sparse representation problem. To the authors' knowledge, few publications utilize joint learning dictionary in change detection; 2) an automatic threshold selection strategy is presented, which minimizes the reconstruction errors of the changed pixels without the prior assumption of the spectral signature. As a result, the threshold value provided by the proposed method can adapt to different data due to the characteristic of joint dictionary learning; and 3) the proposed method makes no prior assumption of the modeling and the handling of the spectral signature, which can be adapted to different data.",94
"Background: Individual studies have demonstrated the potential of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI-MRI) for identifying inflamed bowel segments. However, these studies were conducted with rather small patient cohorts and in most cases by means of MR enterography only. Purpose: To demonstrate the feasibility of detecting inflamed bowel segments in a large collective of patients with Crohn's disease using DWI in MR enteroclysis and MR enterography and to compare the results of both techniques, also considering clinical parameters by means of the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI). Material and Methods: Ninety-six patients underwent MRI enteroclysis and 35 patients MR enterography, both with additional DWI. The HBI as well as apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) in areas of inflamed and normal bowel wall were determined. Thus resulting in 208 bowel segments that were visualized and subsequently statistically analyzed. Results: There were no significant differences in ADC values in MR enteroclysis and MR enterography (P = 0.383 in inflammation, P = 0.223 in normal wall). Areas of inflammation showed statistically highly significant lower ADC values than areas of normal bowel wall (P < 0.001). An ADC threshold of 1.56 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s can distinguish between normal and inflamed bowel segments with a sensitivity of 97.4% and a specificity of 99.2%. A highly significant correlation could be shown between ADC and HBI values (P = 0.001). Conclusion: DWI-MRI facilitates recognition of inflamed bowel segments in patients with Crohn's disease and the ADC values show an excellent correlation to the HBI. There were no significant differences in ADC values in MR enteroclysis and MR enterography. An ADC threshold of 1.56 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s differentiates between normal and inflamed bowel wall.",118
"The aim of this analysis is to assess (1) self-reported chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) symptoms; (2) its association with sociodemographic and clinical characteristics; and (3) treatment dose modifications and its influence on the magnitude of neurotoxicity in a population-based cohort of patients with multiple myeloma (MM). MM patients (n = 156), diagnosed between 2000 and 2014, filled out the EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 (65% response). Data on treatment, outcomes, and dose modifications were extracted from the medical files. Fifty-three percent of patients reported at least one and on average three neuropathy symptoms that bothered them the most during the past week, with tingling toes/feet as most reported. In multivariate analysis, thalidomide, especially higher cumulative dose, was associated with neuropathy (beta = 0.26, CI 95% 0.27-15.34, p = 0.04) and CIPN was not associated with age, sex, time since last course of therapy, number of prior therapies, osteoarthritis, or diabetes. Dose modifications were often applied (65%). Although not statistically significant, a trend towards higher sensory (22 vs. 15 vs. 12, p = 0.22) and motor neuropathy scores (21 vs. 15 vs. 11, p = 0.36) was observed among patients receiving dose modification because of CIPN (31%) compared to those receiving a dose modification for another reason or no dose modification, without altering treatment response. CIPN is a common dose limiting side effect in patients with MM. Severity of CIPN was mainly affected by treatment with thalidomide. In spite of dose modifications, patients still reported somewhat higher neuropathy scores without altered response rates. Early dose modification based on a more reliable tool for CIPN measurements may prove value.",15
"Prescribed burning (PB) is a widespread management technique for wildfire hazard abatement. Understanding PB effects on tree ecophysiology is key to defining burn prescriptions aimed at reducing fire hazard in Mediterranean pine plantations, such as Pinus pinea L. stands. We assessed physiological responses of adult P. pinea trees to PB using a combination of dendroecological, anatomical, hydraulic and isotopic analyses. Tree-ring widths, xylem cell wall thickness, lumen area, hydraulic diameter and tree ring delta C-13 and delta O-18 were measured in trees on burned and control sites. Vulnerability curves were elaborated to assess tree hydraulic efficiency or safety. Despite the relatively intense thermal treatment (the residence time of temperatures above 50 degrees C at the stem surface ranged between 242 and 2239 s), burned trees did not suffer mechanical damage to stems, nor significant reduction in radial growth. Moreover, the PB did not affect xylem structure and tree hydraulics. No variations in C-13-derived water use efficiency were recorded. This confirmed the high resistance of P. pinea to surface fire at the stem base. However, burned trees showed consistently lower 6180 values in the PB year, as a likely consequence of reduced competition for water and nutrients due to the understory burning, which increased both photosynthetic activity and stomatal conductance. Our multi-approach analysis offers new perspectives on post-fire survival strategies of P. pinea in an environment where fires are predicted to increase in frequency and severity during the 21st century.",83
"The water footprint (WF) has been developed within the water resources research community as a volumetric measure of freshwater appropriation. The concept is used to assess water use along supply chains, sustainability of water use within river basins, efficiency of water use, equitability of water allocation and dependency on water in the supply chain. With the purpose of integrating the WF in life cycle assessment of products, LCA scholars have proposed to weight the original volumetric WF by the water scarcity in the catchment where the WF is located, thus obtaining a water-scarcity weighted WF that reflects the potential local environmental impact of water consumption. This paper provides an elaborate critique on this proposal. The main points are: (1) counting litres of water use differently based on the level of local water scarcity obscures the actual debate about water scarcity, which is about allocating water resources to competing uses and depletion at a global scale; (2) the neglect of green water consumption ignores the fact that green water is scarce as well; (3) since water scarcity in a catchment increases with growing overall water consumption in the catchment, multiplication of the consumptive water use of a specific process or activity with water scarcity implies that the resultant weighted WF of a process or activity will be affected by the WFs of other processes or activities, which cannot be the purpose of an environmental performance indicator; (4) the LCA treatment of the WF is inconsistent with how other environmental footprints are defined; and (5) the Water Stress Index, the most cited water scarcity metric in the LCA community, lacks meaningful physical interpretation. It is proposed to incorporate the topic of freshwater scarcity in LCA as a ""natural resource depletion"" category, considering depletion from a global perspective. Since global freshwater demand is growing while global freshwater availability is limited, it is key to measure the comparative claim of different products on the globe's limited accessible and usable freshwater flows.

"To date, only a few reports described the potential factors influencing the position of conus medullaris. One previous study revealed no significant change of conus locations in patients with idiopathic scoliosis; however, the effect of ankylosing spondylitis (AS)-related thoracolumbar kyphosis on conus position remains unexplored. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the variation of conus medullaris terminations in patients with thoracolumbar kyphosis secondary to AS when compared with normal subjects, and evaluated the relationship between conus positions and the magnitude of kyphosis. In this study, MR images of 96 AS patients with thoracolumbar kyphosis, including 86 males and 10 females with an average of 34.6 years (range, 17-65 years), and 100 age-matched normal controls were reviewed to determine the conus terminations in relation to spinal levels. Sagittal parameters of the AS group measured on radiograph included: global kyphosis (GK), thoracic kyphosis (TK), lumbar lordosis (LL), and thoracolumbar junction (TLJ). Finally, conus tips located at the mean level of the lower 3rd of L1 in both groups, there was no significant difference of the conus distributions between AS and control group (P = 0.49). In addition, conus medullaris displayed similar positions in AS patients among various apical region groups (P = 0.88), and no significant difference was found when AS population was stratified into GK ranges of 30 degrees (P = 0.173). Also, no remarkable correlation of the conus positions with GK (r= -0.15, P= 0.15), TK (r= -0.10, P= 0.34), LL (r= -0.10, P= 0.32), and TLJ (r= -0.06, P= 0.54) was identified. This study showed the conus terminations displayed a wide range of distributions in AS patients with thoracolumbar kyphosis, which was similar to normal subjects. Moreover, the conus located at a relatively fixed position and would not be affected by the change of kyphosis magnitude, which is an important knowledge that surgeons should acquire in surgical correction of the deformity in these patients.",107
"Negative attitudes are a major barrier to the equality of people with disabilities. Governments and other organizations have implemented numerous programmes to change attitudes towards people with disabilities. We analyse published evidence about the effectiveness of such programmes using a framework of the interrelationship among three levels of policy intervention to change attitudes: personal level directed at changing the attitudes of individuals; organizational level concerning attitudinal barriers in domains such as employment, education and health; and government level - legally mandating behaviour change. The analysis finds that the following policy types can be effective if used together: policies that involve direct contact with people with disability; information and awareness campaigns; education and training about disability; and antidiscrimination enforcement. Policy characteristics that contribute to effectiveness include a positive programme experience for participants; multifaceted and prolonged interventions; and adequate programme resources. Policy effectiveness to change attitudes relies on corresponding reinforcement at all three policy levels.",61
"Individuals with a growth mindset believe that all failures are opportunities and that their baseline intelligence and talent can be used for continuous improvement. Individuals with a fixed mindset believe that baseline intelligence and talent cannot be developed. A growth mindset is associated with greater academic success and greater resilience in the face of failure or stress. Second-year veterinary students completed three surveys to determine mindset, perceived levels of stress, and life change score. Of 57 students, 70% had a strong growth mindset or a growth mindset with some fixed ideas. No students had a strong fixed mindset. Mindset was not correlated with GPA or perceived stress level. Colleges of veterinary medicine can assist students by providing resources and training for stress management, including training in how to further develop a growth mindset.",29
"Appraisal research has traditionally focused on negative emotions but has not addressed issues concerning the relationships between several positive emotions and appraisals in daily life and the extent to which co-occurrence of positive emotions can be explained by overlap in appraisals. Driven by a priori hypotheses on appraisal-emotion relationships, this study investigated 12 positive emotions and 13 appraisal dimensions using Ecological Momentary Assessment. The results provide strong evidence that positive emotions and appraisals correlate significantly in daily life. Importantly, we found that the positive emotions' overlap on theoretically relevant, as compared to irrelevant, appraisals was stronger and more predictive of their co-occurrence. Furthermore, appraisal overlap on theoretically relevant appraisals predicted the co-occurrence of positive emotions even when the appraisal of pleasantness was excluded, indicating that positive emotions do not co-occur just by virtue of their shared valence. Our findings affirmed and refined the appraisal profiles of positive emotions and underscore the importance of appraisals in accounting for the commonality and differences among positive emotions.",65
"In order to meet the requirement of high sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), this study develops and optimizes a piezoresistive pressure sensor by using double silicon nanowire (SiNW) as the piezoresistive sensing element. First of all, ANSYS finite element method and voltage noise models are adopted to optimize the sensor size and the sensor output (such as sensitivity, voltage noise and SNR). As a result, the sensor of the released double SiNW has 1.2 times more sensitivity than that of single SiNW sensor, which is consistent with the experimental result. Our result also displays that both the sensitivity and SNR are closely related to the geometry parameters of SiNW and its doping concentration. To achieve high performance, a p-type implantation of 5 x 10(18) cm(3) and geometry of 10 mu m long SiNW piezoresistor of 1400 nm x 100 nm cross area and 6 mu m thick diaphragm of 200 mu m x 200 mu m are required. Then, the proposed SiNW pressure sensor is fabricated by using the standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) lithography process as well as wet-etch release process. This SiNW pressure sensor produces a change in the voltage output when the external pressure is applied. The involved experimental results show that the pressure sensor has a high sensitivity of 495 mV/V.MPa in the range of 0-100 kPa. Nevertheless, the performance of the pressure sensor is influenced by the temperature drift. Finally, for the sake of obtaining accurate and complete information over wide temperature and pressure ranges, the data fusion technique is proposed based on the back-propagation (BP) neural network, which is improved by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The particle swarm optimization-back-propagation (PSO-BP) model is implemented in hardware using a 32-bit STMicroelectronics (STM32) microcontroller. The results of calibration and test experiments clearly prove that the PSO-BP neural network can be effectively applied to minimize sensor errors derived from temperature drift.",51
"Human brain is extraordinarily complex and yet its origin is a simple tubular structure. Its development during the fetal period is characterized by a series of accurately organized events which underlie the mechanisms of dramatic structural changes during fetal development. Revealing detailed anatomy at different stages of human fetal brain development provides insight on understanding not only this highly ordered process, but also the neurobiological foundations of cognitive brain disorders such as mental retardation, autism, schizophrenia, bipolar and language impairment. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and histology are complementary tools which are capable of delineating the fetal brain structures at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. In this review, the structural development of the fetal brains has been characterized with DTI and histology. Major components of the fetal brain, including cortical plate, fetal white matter and cerebral wall layer between the ventricle and subplate, have been delineated with DTI and histology. Anisotropic metrics derived from DTI were used to quantify the microstructural changes during the dynamic process of human fetal cortical development and prenatal development of other animal models. Fetal white matter pathways have been traced with DTI-based tractography to reveal growth patterns of individual white matter tracts and corticocortical connectivity. These detailed anatomical accounts of the structural changes during fetal period may provide the clues of detecting developmental and cognitive brain disorders at their early stages. The anatomical information from DTI and histology may also provide reference standards for diagnostic radiology of premature newborns. (C) 2013 ISDN. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Melatonin is a methoxyindole synthesized and secreted principally by the pineal gland at night under normal light/dark conditions. The endogenous rhythm of secretion is generated by the suprachiasmatic nuclei and entrained to the light/dark cycle. Light is able to either suppress or synchronize melatonin production according to the light schedule. The nycthohemeral rhythm of this hormone can be evaluated by repeated measurement of plasma or saliva melatonin or urine sulfatoxymelatonin, the main hepatic metabolite. The primary physiological function of melatonin, whose secretion adjusts to night length, is to convey information concerning the daily cycle of light and darkness to body structures. This information is used for the organisation of functions, which respond to changes in the photoperiod such as the seasonal rhythms. Seasonal rhythmicity of physiological functions in humans related to possible alteration of the melatonin message remains, however, of limited evidence in temperate areas under field conditions. Also, the daily melatonin secretion, which is a very robust biochemical signal of night, can be used for the organisation of circadian rhythms. Although functions of this hormone in humans are mainly based on correlations between clinical observations and melatonin secretion, there is some evidence that melatonin stabilises and strengthens coupling of circadian rhythms, especially of core temperature and sleep-wake rhythms. The circadian organisation of other physiological functions depend also on the melatonin signal, for instance immune, antioxidant defences, haemostasis and glucose regulation. The difference between physiological and pharmacological effects of melatonin is not always clear but is based upon consideration of dose and not of duration of the hormone message. It is admitted that a ""physiological"" dose provides plasma melatonin levels in the same order of magnitude as a nocturnal peak. Since the regulating system of melatonin secretion is complex, following central and autonomic pathways, there are many pathophysiological situations where melatonin secretion can be disturbed. The resulting alteration could increase the predisposition to disease, add to the severity of symptoms or modify the course and outcome of the disorder. Since melatonin receptors display a very wide distribution in the body, putative therapeutic indications of this compound are multiple. Great advances in this field could be achieved by developing multicentre trials in a large series of patients, in order to establish efficacy of melatonin and absence of long-term toxicity.

"Mott cells are atypical plasmacytes recognized microscopically by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) distensions (Russell bodies) a result of retained secretory product (antibody). Originally associated with parasitism, they are observed in a broad spectrum of immunopathology, sometimes involving hypergammaglobulinemia. Few descriptions of Mott cells appear in avian literature. The purpose of the manuscript is to provide examples identified by light microscopy in three poultry species. Transmission electron micrographs (TEM) of plasmacytes from the turkey oviduct mucosa are included for comparison with Mott cell light microscopic images. Wright's stained blood and bone marrow from commercial and specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens, ducks, and turkeys are the sources. Mott cell positive samples commonly occurred with leukocytosis or leukemoid reactions, polymicrobial bacteremia, and fungemia. Atypical granulocytes and leukocytes regularly accompanied Mott cells. It is proposed that circulating Mott cells are ""sentinels"" indicative of stress, dyscrasia, and pathology. Moreover, Mott cells, like other atypia, complicate the interpretation of simple heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratios. As Mott cells are defective plasmacytes these observations address hematology, immunology, pathology, and welfare issues.",33
"Background: The literature has shown good results with partial repairs of large and massive tears of rotator cuff but the role of factors that affect reparability is less clear. The purpose of this study was twofold, 1) to examine clinical outcomes following complete or partial repair of large or massive full-thickness rotator cuff tear, and 2) to explore the value of clinical and surgical factors in predicting reparability. Methods: This was a secondary data analysis of consecutive patients with large or massive rotator cuff tear who required surgical treatment (arthroscopic complete or partial repair) and were followed up for two years. Disability measures included the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), the relative Constant-Murley score (CMS) and the shortened version of the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (ShortWORC). The relationship between predictors and reparability was examined through logistic regressions and chi-square statistics as appropriate. Within group change over time and between group differences in disability outcomes, range of motion and strength were examined by student's T-tests and non-parametric statistics. Results: One hundred and twenty two patients (41 women, 81 men, mean age 64, SD = 9) were included in the analysis. There were 86 large (39 fully reparable, 47 partially reparable) and 36 (10 fully reparable, 26 partially reparable) massive tears. Reparability was not associated with age, sex, or pre-operative active flexion or abduction (p >0.05) but the fully reparable tear group showed a better pre-operative ASES score (p = 0.01) and better active external rotation in neutral (p = 0.01). Reparability was associated with tear shape (p < 0.0001), size (p = 0.002), and tendon quality (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Reparability of large or massive tears is affected by a number of clinical and surgical factors. Patients whose tears could not be fully repaired showed a statistically significant improvement in range of motion, strength and disability at 2 years, although they had slightly inferior results compared to those with complete repairs.",97
"Scarcity of water, pollution load, political issues and rising population have drawn great attention for proper management of water resources such as groundwater in the 21st century. The evaluation of groundwater quality is a critical element in the assessment of water resources. The quality/potability of water that is consumed defines the baseline of protection against many diseases and infections. The present study aims to calculate the water quality index (WQI) by the analysis of seven physicochemical parameters according to the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) to assess the suitability of water for drinking, irrigation purposes and other human uses. In the present investigation, ten groundwater samples were collected from various parts of Seraidi municipality area located in the north-east of Algeria, Physico-chemical parameters such as pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, phosphates, nitrates, turbidity and fecal coliforms were analyzed. The overall WQI values for all the samples were found to be in the range of 68-86, which reveals the fact that the quality of all the samples is only medium to good and could be used for drinking and other domestic uses only after proper treatment.",96
"Important steps during the prenatal development of the bovine uterus are described using conventional hematoxylineosin staining of fetuses from different developmental stages [crown-rump length (CRL) 9.2-94.0 cm]. Additionally, a number of intermediate filaments (keratin 7, 8, 14, 18, 19; and vimentin), the basement membrane protein laminin, smooth-muscle marker (SMA), and S100 were studied to further characterize certain differentiation processes. During early development, the uterine epithelium is simple or (pseudo) stratified with bud-like protrusions. Developing caruncles can be observed in the corpus uteri at a CRL of 15.8 cm onwards, showing a simple, keratin-positive epithelium. In contrast, the intercaruncular areas are characterized by a (pseudo) stratified epithelium, which also shows positive staining in a different manner for the investigated keratins. A differentiation of smooth muscle cell layers can be observed from a CRL of 24.4 cm onwards. Intense SMA-positive cells/fibers, arranged perpendicularly to the developing circular SMA-positive muscle cell layer, can be found preferentially located in the developing caruncles. Lymphocytes occur in the uterine epithelium and stroma in the corpora and cornua of fetuses with a CLR of 15.8 cm and higher. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel",75
"In this paper, we propose a client-server based framework that alleviates the dissemination of XSS worms from the OSN. The framework initially creates the views corresponding to retrieved request on the server-side. Such views indicate that which part of the generated web page on the server can be accessed by user depending on the generated Access Control List (ACL). Secondly, JavaScript attack vectors are retrieved from the HTTP response by referring the blacklist repository of attack vectors. Finally, injection of sanitization primitives will be done on the client-side in place of extracted JavaScript attack vectors. The framework will perform the sanitization on such attack vectors strictly in a context-aware manner. The experimental testing of our framework has performed on the two platforms of open source OSN-based web applications. The observed detection rate of JavaScript attack vectors was effective and acceptable as compared to other existing XSS defensive methodologies. The proposed framework has optimized the method of auto-context-aware sanitization in contrast to other existing approaches and hence incurs a low and acceptable performance overhead.",46
"N-6-Methyladenosine (m(6)A) is a prevalent modification present in the mRNAs of higher eukaryotes. YTH domain family 2 (YTHDF2), an m(6)A reader protein, can recognize mRNA m(6)A sites to mediate mRNA degradation. However, the regulatory mechanism of YTHDF2 is poorly understood. To this end, we investigated the post-transcriptional regulation of YTHDF2. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that the microRNA miR-145 might target the 3-untranslated region (3-UTR) of YTHDF2 mRNA. The levels of miR-145 were negatively correlated with those of YTHDF2 mRNA in clinical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues, and immunohistochemical staining revealed that YTHDF2 was closely associated with malignancy of HCC. Interestingly, miR-145 decreased the luciferase activities of 3-UTR of YTHDF2 mRNA. Mutation of predicted miR-145 binding sites in the 3-UTR of YTHDF2 mRNA abolished the miR-145-induced decrease in luciferase activity. Overexpression of miR-145 dose-dependently down-regulated YTHDF2 expression in HCC cells at the levels of both mRNA and protein. Conversely, inhibition of miR-145 resulted in the up-regulation of YTHDF2 in the cells. Dot blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining revealed that the overexpression of miR-145 strongly increased m(6)A levels relative to those in control HCC cells, and this increase could be blocked by YTHDF2 overexpression. Moreover, miR-145 inhibition strongly decreased m(6)A levels, which were rescued by treatment with a small interfering RNA-based YTHDF2 knockdown. Thus, we conclude that miR-145 modulates m(6)A levels by targeting the 3-UTR of YTHDF2 mRNA in HCC cells.",42
"A novel low voltage high power multi-phase inverter is presented. Based on an already designed ISCAD machine the specification of an electrical power up to 240 kW at a dc-link voltage below 60 V has to be achieved. For spreading the high currents and the corresponding power losses a 60 phase machine is built up. Each phase is connected with one dedicated half-Bridge, which includes power components and the driver circuit. The requirements on electrical circuits and components are investigated to ensure a safe operation of the system against voltage transients. Further simulations show the electrical and thermal behavior of the printed circuit boards. Experimental results validate the simulations and show the system boundaries.",45
"Several studies in our lab and others have demonstrated age-related declines in mnemonic discrimination during a recognition memory paradigm using repeated items, similar lures, and novel foils. In particular, older adults exhibit a shift in lure discriminability, identifying similar lures as old items at a greater rate than young adults. This shift likely reflects deficits in pattern separation processing as a result of underlying changes in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Here, we explored whether alterations in the task design could rescue the age-related impairment or whether it was ubiquitous as one might expect if the neurobiological mechanisms were truly disturbed by typical aging. Despite overt instructions to study item details during encoding, we replicated the age-related deficit in mnemonic discrimination. We established reliable effects with short lists of stimuli and with repeated testing. Altering the task design from a study/test to a continuous recognition paradigm replicated the age-related shift in lure discrimination as well. Modifying the task to an old/new response (rather than old/similar/new) showed the same effect and a d' analysis showed that lure items were more akin to target items in older adults. Finally, we varied the test instructions in order to promote gist or veridical responses in the old/new task. Even these overt veridical test instructions did not ameliorate older adults' lure discrimination problems. Together, these findings demonstrate the robust nature of this age-related deficit and support the hypothesis that typical aging results in neurobiological changes that underlie this impairment.",78
"The study of the classification of Apples and Oranges in a warehouse has been undertaken in a three-qubit system using the method of repeated iterations in Grover's algorithm and Ventura's algorithm separately. Operator describing an inversion about average has been constructed as a square matrix of order eight, the phase inversion operators and corresponding iteration operators for patterns separately representing Apples and Oranges have been derived, and various possible superpositions as the choice for search states for the classification of these patterns have been obtained for starting states consisting of two patterns and a single pattern, respectively. It has been demonstrated that on the second iteration of the exclusion superposition by the corresponding iteration operators, the patterns Apples and Oranges, respectively, are most suitably classified using the Grover's algorithm. The probabilities of classifications of Apples have also been calculated by using Ventura's algorithm (Ventura and Martinez in Inf Sci 124: 273-296, 2000; Found Phys Lett 12: 547-559, 1999) for all the possible superpositions as the search states, and the results have been compared with those of Grover's algorithm and it has been demonstrated that in general for classification of a given pattern (Apples) in three-qubit system, the Grover's and Ven-tura's algorithms are effective in the cases where the number of patterns in the stored database is larger or smaller, respectively.",57
"Water is a precious resource. Its demand is rising rapidly and has already exceeded the supply capacity of natural sources in many cities. Airports are spread over vast areas which are normally free from birds and pollution and thus offer immense opportunities for rainwater harvesting which could, to a large extent, meet their non-potable water requirements. This article reviews rainwater treatment procedures at various airports which not only provide a valuable resource for their own consumption but also prevent the entry of pollutants directly into the environment. It also discusses the models and approaches to assess the rainwater harvesting potential of airports on parameters of cost and reliability. It explains the stages involved in the rainwater harvesting systems and how some airports have implemented rainwater treatment systems. Finally, it identifies the gaps at various stages and discusses possible improvements in the near future.",95
"Paper describes experiences obtained during the construction of high soil reinforced retaining wall. Such walls are now used during the foundation of large logistic and distribution centres on inclined terrain. First problems appeared roughly 2 years after the wall construction, when wide tensile cracks on the fill surface were observed behind the zone of reinforcement. First step of problem evaluation showed that this crack is connected to wall overturning. Therefore the reconstruction was recommended, upper part was removed and constructed under new evaluation of all relevant limit states and design situations. Phase of reconstruction was monitored and was used as an approval of the safe design. Experiences obtained during all described phases create an important know-how for next similar applications.",93
"Urinary incontinence (UI) and overactive bladder (OAB) are health conditions that have higher prevalence rates later in life and can lead to a profound negative effect on UI-related quality of life. Evidence is lacking on the effects of conservative multimodal physical therapy (PT) interventions for UI and OAB in the older population. This case study presents a multimodal PT intervention for a 71-year-old woman with UI and OAB. After 4 sessions, the patient demonstrated improved UI-related quality of life and significantly decreased urinary symptoms. Urinary Distress Index Short Form (UDI-6) scores improved from 54.6 to 16.67. Pelvic floor muscle performance improved with increased strength, endurance, and coordination. This case supports the use of multimodal PT interventions for older patients with UI and OAB.",17
"In this article, the new exact travelling wave solutions of the nonlinear space-time fractional Burger's, the nonlinear space-time fractional Telegraph and the nonlinear space-time fractional Fisher equations have been found. Based on a nonlinear fractional complex transformation, certain fractional partial differential equations can be turned into ordinary differential equations of integer order in the sense of the Jumarie's modified Riemann-Liouville derivative. The (G'/G)-expansion method is effective for constructing solutions to the nonlinear fractional equations, and it appears to be easier and more convenient by means of a symbolic computation system.

"Changes in the levels of three structurally and functionally different important thermoprotectant molecules, namely small heat shock proteins (sHsps), trehalose, and lipids, have been investigated upon heat shock in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Both alpha-crystallin-type sHsps (Hsp15.8 and Hsp16) were induced after prolonged high-temperature treatment but with different kinetic profiles. The shsp null mutants display a weak, but significant, heat sensitivity indicating their importance in the thermal stress management. The heat induction of sHsps is different in wild type and in highly heat-sensitive trehalose-deficient (tps1 Delta) cells; however, trehalose level did not show significant alteration in shsp mutants. The altered timing of trehalose accumulation and induction of sHsps suggest that the disaccharide might provide protection at the early stage of the heat stress while elevated amount of sHsps are required at the later phase. The cellular lipid compositions of two different temperature-adapted wild-type S. pombe cells are also altered according to the rule of homeoviscous adaptation, indicating their crucial role in adapting to the environmental temperature changes. Both Hsp15.8 and Hsp16 are able to bind to different lipids isolated from S. pombe, whose interaction might provide a powerful protection against heat-induced damages of the membranes. Our data suggest that all the three investigated thermoprotectant macromolecules play a pivotal role during the thermal stress management in the fission yeast.",29
"Among all RNAs, tRNA exhibits the largest number and the widest variety of post-transcriptional modifications. Modifications within the anticodon stem loop, mainly at the wobble position and purine-37, collectively contribute to stabilize the codon-anticodon pairing, maintain the translational reading frame, facilitate the engagement of the ribosomal decoding site and enable translocation of tRNA from the A-site to the P-site of the ribosome. Modifications at the wobble uridine (U34) of tRNAs reading two degenerate codons ending in purine are complex and result from the activity of two multi-enzyme pathways, the IscS-MnmA and MnmEG pathways, which independently work on positions 2 and 5 of the U34 pyrimidine ring, respectively, and from a third pathway, controlled by TrmL (YibK), that modifies the 2'-hydroxyl group of the ribose. MnmEG is the only common pathway to all the mentioned tRNAs, and involves the GTP- and FAD-dependent activity of the MnmEG complex and, in some cases, the activity of the bifunctional enzyme MnmC. The Escherichia coli MnmEG complex catalyzes the incorporation of an aminomethyl group into the C5 atom of U34 using methylene-tetrahydrofolate and glycine or ammonium as donors. The reaction requires GTP hydrolysis, probably to assemble the active site of the enzyme or to carry out substrate recognition. Inactivation of the evolutionarily conserved MnmEG pathway produces a pleiotropic phenotype in bacteria and mitochondrial dysfunction in human cell lines. While the IscS-MnmA pathway and the MnmA-mediated thiouridylation reaction are relatively well understood, we have limited information on the reactions mediated by the MnmEG, MnmC and TrmL enzymes and on the precise role of proteins MnmE and MnmG in the MnmEG complex activity. This review summarizes the present state of knowledge on these pathways and what we still need to know, with special emphasis on the MnmEG pathway. (c) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

"The analysis and interpretation of skeletal lead is relatively common in anthropological research employing chemical analyses of human tissues. To provide an additional dimension to such research, this paper presents the rationale for, and a case study illustrating the use of skeletal lead isotope data to address problems of group affinity. The radiogenic origin of three of the four stable lead isotopes give lead from any given geologic deposit (source) a characteristic isotopic ''signature''. As lead does not fractionate measurably in biological systems, including human metabolism, the isotopic composition of skeletal lead reflects the source(s) of lead to which individuals were exposed. It is assumed that different cultural groups will be exposed to different sources of lead through natural processes and cultural practices. Given this assumption, lead isotope analysis of eight unidentified skeletons (two Native North Americans and six Fur Traders) from a 19th century fur trade cemetery was conducted. The results indicate that, as predicted, the Native North American and Fur Trader skeletal remains have different skeletal lead isotopic compositions. The differences are generally congruent with the two primary sources of lead available. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited",32
"Context A number of systematic literature reviews and mapping studies (SLRs) covering numerous primary research studies on various aspects of agile software development (ASD) exist. Objective: The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the SLRs on ASD research topics for software engineering researchers and practitioners. Method: We followed the tertiary study guidelines by Kitchenham et al. to find SLRs published between late 1990s to December 2015. Results: We found 28 SLRs focusing on ten different ASD research areas: adoption, methods, practices, human and social aspects, CMMI, usability, global software engineering (GSE), organizational agility, embedded systems, and software product line engineering. The number of SLRs on ASD topics, similar to those on software engineering (SE) topics in general, is on the rise. A majority of the SLRs applied standardized guidelines and the quality of these SLRs on ASD topics was found to be slightly higher for journal publications than for conferences. While some individuals and institutions seem to lead this area, the spread of authors and institutions is wide. With respect to prior review recommendations, significant progress was noticed in the area of connecting agile to established domains such as usability, CMMI, and GSE; and considerable progress was observed in focusing on management-oriented approaches as Scrum and sustaining ASD in different contexts such as embedded systems. Conclusion: SLRs of ASD studies are on the rise and cover a variety of ASD aspects, ranging from early adoption issues to newer applications of ASD such as in product line engineering. ASD research can benefit from further primary and secondary studies on evaluating benefits and challenges of ASD methods, agile hybrids in large-scale setups, sustainability, motivation, teamwork, and project management; as well as a fresh review of empirical studies in ASD to cover the period post 2008.

"Changes in retrovirus acquisition/transmission behaviors have been reported in Brazil, with a concerning increase in HIV-1-infected individuals aged 15-39 years. In Sao Paulo, HIV-1/HTLV-1 and HIV-1/HTLV-2 coinfections have been associated with intravenous drug use and failure to detect HTLV-1/2 (human T cell lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2) with immunosuppression and the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Negative results for HTLV serologic [western blotting (WB)] and molecular [real-time PCR pol (qPCR)] confirmatory assays have been reported, whereas the best sensitivity has been found for INNO-LIA (LIA). In this study, we expand our previous data by analyzing a group of young patients (n = 1,383; median age 35.6 years) who recently acquired HIV by sexual contact, the majority of whom were HAART naive, and comparing the performances of four HTLV confirmatory assays: LIA, WB, qPCR, and PCR-RFLP (tax). We confirmed HTLV infection in 58 (4.2%) blood samples: 29 HTLV-1, 24 HTLV-2, 1 HTLV-1+HTLV-2, and 4 HTLV. LIA, WB, qPCR, and PCR-RFLP sensitivities were 94.8%, 82.8%, 79.2%, and 74.5%, respectively. Associations of HTLV infection with female gender (OR = 2.28, 1.31-4.00) and age >40 years (p < .0001) were detected. The results confirm the low sensitivities of molecular assays and the best performance of LIA in detecting HTLV-1/2 in such patients. We hypothesize that the negative PCR results are due to the presence of defective provirus and/or low proviral load circulating in such patients, with inconclusive WB coinciding with the seroconversion period. Corroborating the associations obtained, repeated exposure is required for HTLV sexual transmission/acquisition, which is more efficient from male to female.",132
"Semiconductor photocatalysis is a promising approach to combat both environmental pollution and the global energy shortage. Advanced TiO2-based photocatalysts with novel photoelectronic properties are benchmark materials that have been pursued for their high solar energy conversion efficiency. Among the different morphological TiO2 nanostructures, TiO2 nanobelts (NBs) attract more attention due to their unique physical properties and ideal ID ribbon-like morphology that is favorable for constructing heterostructures by assembling second-phase nanoparticles on the surface of the NBs. A large number of studies have proven that well-designed TiO2 NB heterostructures can not only broaden the photocatalytically active light band of TiO2 but also enhance the light absorption performance and the photo-induced carrier separation ability. The TiO2 NB heterostructure has become a versatile and powerful tool for building high-performance TiO2-based photocatalysts, which has stimulated intense research activities focused on the growth, properties, and applications of the 1D TiO2 NB and its heterostructures. This review attempts to cover all these aspects, including the underlying principles and key functional features of TiO2 NBs and TiO2 NB heterostructures in a comprehensive way and also discuss the prospects of this type of novel hybrid photocatalyst.

"Computer Programming is a core subject of almost all degrees of Engineering that is perceived as a very complex matter for the students, because it is very different from the other core subjects (Physics, Calculus, Algebra, Chemistry, Graphics Expression) that are more familiar to students. Programming combines in a balanced way the two fundamental steps when developing an Engineering product, design and implementation (coding), but with the important difference in the lower costs of the implementation phase, which permits students building and testing the proposed designs. Besides, the new European Higher Education Area (EHEA) is based both in the acquisition of competencies and skills by the student rather than in the accumulation of knowledge, and in the use of the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS), which supposes an important challenge for the teaching model. In this paper we show our eight years experience in developing a hybrid methodology for teaching Computer Programming in the degrees of Mechanical, Electrical, Electronic and Chemistry Engineering at the University of Almeria (Spain). We integrate traditional teaching methods (participative master class for transmission of information) with modern methods (problem-based learning, collaborative-team working, autonomous working, or tutoring). The different methods of teaching are supported by a hardware-software infrastructure of virtual teaching (Blackboard platform) and a very detailed planning where activities are highly focused and weekly organized. It includes periodical tests for the evaluation of the progress of the student. We think that the adoption and tuning of these learning methods will enhance the skills of the future engineers in the computer programming area.",40
"How to develop a trust management model and then to efficiently control and manage nodes is an important issue in the scope of social network security. In this paper, a trust management model based on a cloud model is proposed. The cloud model uses a specific computation operator to achieve the transformation from qualitative concepts to quantitative computation. Additionally, this can also be used to effectively express the fuzziness, randomness and the relationship between them of the subjective trust. The node trust is divided into reputation trust and transaction trust. In addition, evaluation methods are designed, respectively. Firstly, the two-dimension trust cloud evaluation model is designed based on node's comprehensive and trading experience to determine the reputation trust. The expected value reflects the average trust status of nodes. Then, entropy and hyper-entropy are used to describe the uncertainty of trust. Secondly, the calculation methods of the proposed direct transaction trust and the recommendation transaction trust involve comprehensively computation of the transaction trust of each node. Then, the choosing strategies were designed for node to trade based on trust cloud. Finally, the results of a simulation experiment in P2P network file sharing on an experimental platform directly reflect the objectivity, accuracy and robustness of the proposed model, and could also effectively identify the malicious or unreliable service nodes in the system. In addition, this can be used to promote the service reliability of the nodes with high credibility, by which the stability of the whole network is improved.",46
"The use of caffeine, nicotine and some major metabolites was investigated by wastewater analysis in 13 sewage treatment plants (STPs) across Italy, and their suitability was tested as qualitative and quantitative biomarkers for assessing population size and dynamics. A specific analytical method based on mass spectrometry was developed and validated in raw urban wastewater, and included two caffeine metabolites, 1-methylxanthine and 7-methylxanthine, never reported in wastewater before. All these compounds were found widely at the mu g/L level. Mass loads, calculated by multiplying concentrations by the wastewater daily flow rate and normalized to the population served by each plant, were used to compare the profiles from different cities. Some regional differences were observed in the mass loads, especially for nicotine metabolites, which were significantly higher in the south than in the center and north of Italy, reflecting smoking prevalences from population surveys. There were no significant weekly trends, although the mean mass loads of caffeine and its metabolites were slightly lower during the weekend. Most caffeine and nicotine metabolites fulfilled the requirements for an ideal biomarker for the assessment of population size, i.e. being easily detectable in wastewater, stable in sewage and during sampling, and reflecting human metabolism. Nicotine metabolites were tested as quantitative biomarkers to estimate population size and the results agreed well with census data. Caffeine and its metabolites were confirmed as good qualitative biomarkers, but additional information is needed on the caffeine metabolism in relation to the multiple sources of its main metabolites. This exploratory study opens the way to the routine use of nicotine metabolites for estimating population size and dynamics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",32
"This study aims to investigate the use of metacognitive online reading strategies among Iraqi students. The research seeks to answer the following research questions: (i) What are the metacognitive online reading strategies of Iraqi fourth year undergraduate students when they read online academic text? (ii) What are the difficulties faced by Iraqi fourth year undergraduates when they read online academic text?. Using a quantitative approach, the study deployed questionnaires which were administered on 50 fourth year students of Al-Salam University College, Baghdad Iraq. The response of the metacognitive online reading strategies among the students was assessed differently. The students adopt online dictionaries, reading e-books and online journal articles are some of the ways to increase the students' reading ability and enhance online reading among English as foreign language (EFL) students from Iraq. The researcher analyzed students metacognitive reading strategies usage and their problems. Based on the quantitative analysis of the students' responses to the SORS questionnaire, the students showed that problem-solving reading strategies (mu= 3.59) is the most frequently used strategy followed by support reading strategies (mu= 3.49) and global reading strategies (mu= 3.42). All these identified themes provide and help the students to improve their reading skills. The researcher recommends that future research examine other reading strategies with online or even print text. Moreover, reading strategies should be taught to English as foreign language (EFL) students.",81
"Pulmonary exposure to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) may cause fibrosing lesions in animal lungs, raising health concerns about such exposure in humans. The mechanisms underlying fibrosis development remain unclear, but they are believed to involve the dysfunction of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Using a mouse model of MWCNT exposure, we found that the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (Timp1) gene was rapidly and highly induced in the lungs by MWCNTs in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Concomitantly, a pronounced elevation of secreted TIMP1 was observed in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and serum. Knockout (KO) of Timp1 in mice caused a significant reduction in fibrotic focus formation, collagen fiber deposition, recruitment of fibroblasts and differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts in the lungs, indicating that TIMP1 plays a critical role in the pulmonary fibrotic response to MWCNTs. At the molecular level, MWCNT exposure significantly increased the expression of the cell proliferation markers Ki-67 and PCNA and a panel of cell cycle-controlling genes in the lungs in a TIMP1-dependent manner. MWCNT-stimulated cell proliferation was most prominent in fibroblasts but not myofibroblasts. Furthermore, MWCNTs elicited a significant induction of CD63 and integrin 1 in lung fibroblasts, leading to the formation of a TIMP1/CD63/integrin 1 complex on the surface of fibroblasts in vivo and in vitro, which triggered the phosphorylation and activation of Erk1/2. Our study uncovers a new pathway through which induced TIMP1 critically modulates the pulmonary fibrotic response to MWCNTs by promoting fibroblast activation and proliferation via the TIMP1/CD63/integrin 1 axis and ERK signaling.",3
"Introduction: TREM2 is a lipid-sensing activating receptor on microglia known to be important for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but whether it plays a beneficial or detrimental role in disease pathogenesis is controversial. Methods: We analyzed AD risk of TREM2 variants in the NIMH AD Genetics Initiative Study and AD Sequencing Project. We compared each variant's risk and functional impact by a reporter assay. Finally, we analyzed expression of TREM2 on human monocytes. Results: We provide more evidence for increased AD risk associated with several TREM2 variants, and show that these variants decreased or markedly increased binding to TREM2 ligands. We identify HDL and LDL as novel TREM2 ligands. We also show that TREM2 expression in human monocytes is minimal compared to monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Discussion: Our results suggest that TREM2 signaling helps protect against AD but can cause harm in excess, supporting the idea that proper TREM2 function is important to counteract disease progression.

"This paper deals with the thermodynamic analysis of an absorption refrigeration cycle used to cool down the temperature of the intake air in an Internal Combustion Engine using as a heat source the exhaust gas of the engine. The solution of ammonia-water has been selected due to the stability for a wide range of operating temperatures and pressures and the low freezing point. The effects of operating temperatures, pressures, concentrations of strong and weak solutions in the absorption refrigeration cycle were examined to achieve proper heat rejection to the ambient. Potential of increasing Internal Combustion Engine efficiency and reduce pollutant emissions was estimated by means of theoretical models and experimental tests. In order to provide boundary conditions for the absorption refrigeration cycle and to simulate its effect on engine performance, a OD thermodynamic model was used to reproduce the engine performance when the intake air is cooled. Furthermore, a detailed experimental work was carried out to validate the results in real engine operation. Theoretical results show how the absorption refrigeration system decreases the intake air flow temperature down to a temperature around 5 degrees C and even lower by using the bottoming waste heat energy available in the exhaust gases in a wide range of engine operating conditions. In addition, the theoretical analysis estimates the potential of the strategy for increasing the engine indicated efficiency in levels up to 4% also at the operating conditions under evaluation. Finally, this predicted benefit in engine indicated efficiency has been experimentally confirmed by direct testing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",87
"Diseases with sex-dependent expressions may have an etiology in prenatal sex hormone exposure, specifically prenatal androgens. This study examined the relationship between prenatal hormone exposure (as evidenced by the 2D4D ratio), with life stress as a potential moderator/mediator, and adult depressive and/or physical health symptoms. Participants were n = 137 undergraduates from diverse backgrounds. Results indicated a more masculine 2D4D ratio was associated with poorer health in males, but the 2D4D ratio seemed to have little explanatory power for female physical/mental health. In males, a lower ratio (i.e., more masculine) ratio was linked to clinical cutoff scores for depression, higher levels of life stress, and greater depression scores. In addition, the relationship was mediated by life stress, indicating the link between a more masculine ratio and depression was dependent on levels of life stress. The 2040 ratio was also moderated by life stress, such that at high levels of stress a more masculine ratio was associated with more physical symptoms. Overall, while life stress seemed to have the largest impact on physical and mental health for female participants, a more masculine ratio emerged as a risk factor for men, but was strongly governed by the context of reported stress levels.

"Fronto-limbic brain networks involved in regulation of impulsivity and aggression are abnormal in Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). However, it is unclear whether, or to what extent, these personality traits actually modulate brain responses during cognitive processing. Using fMRI, we examined the effects of trait impulsivity, aggression, and depressed mood on regional brain responses in 31 female BPD and 25 control subjects during a Go No-Go task using Ekman faces as targets. First-level contrasts modeled effects of negative emotional context. Second-level regression models used trait impulsivity, aggression and depressed mood as predictor variables of regional brain activations. In BPD, trait impulsivity was positively correlated with activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, orbital frontal cortex (OFC), basal ganglia (BG), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, with no areas of negative correlation. In contrast, aggression was negatively correlated with activation in OFC, hippocampus, and BG, with no areas of positive correlation. Depressed mood had a generally dampening effect on activations. Effects of trait impulsivity on healthy controls differed from effects in BPD, suggesting a disorder-specific response. Negative emotional context and trait impulsivity, but not aggression or depression, diminished task performance across both groups. Negative emotional context may interfere with cognitive functioning in BPD through interaction with the neurobiology of personality traits.",70
"In the present study, we investigated the effect of participants' mood on true and false memories of emotional word lists in the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm. In Experiment 1, we constructed DRM word lists in which all the studied words and corresponding critical lures reflected a specified emotional valence. In Experiment 2, we used these lists to assess mood-congruent true and false memory. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three induced-mood conditions (positive, negative, or neutral) and were presented with word lists comprised of positive, negative, or neutral words. For both true and false memory, there was a mood-congruent effect in the negative mood condition; this effect was due to a decrease in true and false recognition of the positive and neutral words. These findings are consistent with both spreading-activation and fuzzy-trace theories of DRM performance and have practical implications for our understanding of the effect of mood on memory.",78
"Output-only modal identification has seen significant activity in recent years, especially in large-scale structures where controlled input force generation is often difficult to achieve. This has led to the development of new system identification methods which do not require controlled input. They often work satisfactorily if they satisfy some general assumptions - not overly restrictive - regarding the stochasticity of the input. Hundreds of papers covering a wide range of applications appear every year related to the extraction of modal properties from output measurement data in more than two dozen mechanical, aerospace and civil engineering journals. In little more than a decade, concepts of blind source separation (BSS) from the field of acoustic signal processing have been adopted by several researchers and shown that they can be attractive tools to undertake output only modal identification. Originally intended to separate distinct audio sources from a mixture of recordings, mathematical equivalence to problems in linear structural dynamics have since been firmly established. This has enabled many of the developments in the field of BSS to be modified and applied to output-only modal identification problems. This paper reviews over hundred articles related to the application of BSS and their variants to output only modal identification. The main contribution of the paper is to present a literature review of the papers which have appeared on the subject. While a brief treatment of the basic ideas are presented where relevant, a comprehensive and critical explanation of their contents is not attempted. Specific issues related to output-only modal identification and the relative advantages and limitations of BSS methods both from theoretical and application standpoints are discussed. Gap areas requiring additional work are also summarized and the paper concludes with possible future trends in this area. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",49
"Using image processing to extract nodular or linear shadows is a key technique of computer-aided diagnosis schemes. This study proposes a new method for extracting nodular and linear patterns of various sizes in medical images. We have developed a morphology filter bank that creates multiresolution representations of an image. Analysis bank of this filter bank produces nodular and linear patterns at each resolution level. Synthesis bank can then be used to perfectly reconstruct the original image from these decomposed patterns. Our proposed method shows better performance based on a quantitative evaluation using a synthesized image compared with a conventional method based on a Hessian matrix, often used to enhance nodular and linear patterns. In addition, experiments show that our method can be applied to the followings: (1) microcalcifications of various sizes in mammograms can be extracted, (2) blood vessels of various sizes in retinal fundus images can be extracted, and (3) thoracic CT images can be reconstructed while removing normal vessels. Our proposed method is useful for extracting nodular and linear shadows or removing normal structures in medical images.",90
"Numerous long-span bridges have been built throughout the world in recent years. These bridges are progressively damaged by continuous usage throughout their long service life. The failure of local structural components is detrimental to the performance of the entire bridge, furthermore, detecting the local abnormality at an early stage is difficult. This paper explores a novel damage detection method for long-span bridges by incorporating stress influence lines (SILs) in control charts, and validates the efficacy of the method through a case study of the Tsing Ma Suspension Bridge. Damage indices based on SILs are subsequently proposed and applied to hypothetical damage scenarios in which one or two critical bridge components are subjected to severe damage. The comparison study suggests that the first-order difference of SIL change is an accurate indicator for location of the damage. To some extent, different levels of damage can be quantified by using SILs incorporating with X-bar control chart. Results of this study indicate that the proposed SIL-based method offers a promising technique for damage detection in long-span bridges.",97
"Context: Previous studies have reported that caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is associated with lung fibrosis. However, the role of Cav-1 expression in pirfenidone-treated idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is unknown. Objective: This study investigated Cav-1 expression in pirfenidone-treated IPF, and compared the effects of pirfenidone with acetylcysteine and prednisone on IPF. Materials and methods: Rat IPF model was established by endotracheal injection of 5 mg/kg bleomycin A5 into the specific pathogen-free Wistar male rats. Pirfenidone (P, 100 mg/kg once daily), prednisone (H, 5mg/kg once daily) and acetylcysteine (N, 4mg/kg 3 times per day) were used to treat the rat model by intragastric administration for 45 consecutive days, respectively. The normal rats without IPF were used as the controls. After 15, 30 and 45 days of drug treatment, lung histopathology was assessed. The expression of Cav-1 was determined using real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot; the expression of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: After 15, 30 and 45 days of drug treatment, comparison of the three drug-treated groups with the model group showed significantly lower (p < 0.05) significance of airsacculitis and fibrosis scores of lung tissues, as well as expression of TGF-beta 1, TNF-alpha and PDGF, but the expression of Cav-1 was higher (p < 0.05). Compared with the N group, the fibrosis score was significantly lower and the protein expression of Cav-1 was significantly higher in the P group (p<0.05). Additionally, the expression of Cav-1 was negatively correlated with the airsacculitis and fibrosis scores (r = -0.506, p<0.01; r =-0.676, p < 0.01) as well as expression of TGF-beta 1, TNF-alpha and PDGF (r = -0.590, p<0.01; r = -0.530, p < 0.01; r = -0.553, p < 0.01). Discussion and conclusion: Pirfenidone, prednisone and acetylcysteine can inhibit airsacculitis and pulmonary fibrosis in rat IPF models, which may be related with enhanced caveolin-1, reduced TNF-alpha, TGF-beta 1, PDGF.",3
"A new deterministic model for HIV/AIDS that incorporates pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is designed and used to assess the population-level impact of the use of PrEP on the transmission dynamics of the disease within an MSM population. Conditions for the effective control (or elimination) and persistence of HIV/AIDS in the MSM population are determined by rigorously analyzing this model. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis is carried out, using data relevant to HIV transmission dynamics in the MSM community in the U.S. State of Minnesota, to determine the effect of the uncertainties in the parameter values on the outcome (response) variable (the associated reproduction number) and to identify the parameters that have the most effect on the disease transmission dynamics. Numerical simulations show that, with the current rate of administration of antiretroviral treatment (to HIV-infected individuals), HIV burden decreases with increasing PrEP coverage. Furthermore, for this setting, this study suggests that HIV can be effectively controlled in the MSM population if, in addition to the current rate of administration of anti-retroviral therapy in the community, at least 61-77% (with mean of about 70%) of the susceptible members of the MSM community are on PrEP (adjusted by PrEP efficacy).

"Context: Emergency contraception (EC) is use of drug or device to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sexual intercourse. Unlike other regular methods of contraception which are taken prior to the sexual act, EC is used after the unprotected sex. Aim: To assess the knowledge and attitude toward use of emergency contraceptives among medical students. Setting and Design: A cross-sectional questionnaire based study was conducted among all the medical students in the Government Medical College in North-West India. Subjects and Methods: A questionnaire seeking information on knowledge and attitude of undergraduate medical students was administered over a period of 4 weeks in the month of February and March 2014. Statistical Analysis: The data were entered in MS excel and expressed using percentages. Chi-square test was used as a test of statistical significance. Results: About 61.6% (247/401) of the participants were aware about the timing of use of EC. Audio visual media (76.6%; 307/401) was the most common source of information for of these medical students. Conclusions: The lack of appropriate in-depth knowledge of EC among future health care professional should alarm the medical teaching system as EC is the only method that can be used to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex or contraceptive accident.",124
"Background: Patient adherence is important with the increasing use of oral anticancer drugs. Recent studies reported different capecitabine adherence rates based on self-reporting and microelectronic monitoring of the medication bottle. Patient's awareness of being monitored may confound these results. Prescription records provide a larger and more objective dataset for adherence investigation. We report the use of computer algorithm and manual review of prescription and medical documentation to determine the rate of capecitabine adherence. Methods: Two years of capecitabine prescription records from five ambulatory cancer centres were reviewed. Prescription data were extracted using a custom Java-based software tool to compare the predicted vs. actual dispensing date. The difference between the dates was the primary adherence measure ( altered treatment date incident) and estimated using a computer algorithm and by manual review of medical charts. Results: Of 4412 refill prescriptions, 45.2% was associated with an altered treatment date incident based on the initial computer algorithm. This was reduced to 29.5% after adjusting for clinic scheduling processes and 10.2% after manual chart review to adjust for valid reasons for delay. The reasons for altered treatment date incident were not identified in 52.2% of prescriptions. Conclusions: Adherence rate of capecitabine based on refill data seem to be high and consistent with other findings based on patient self-report. Population analysis of prescription data with custom computer algorithm may identify trends in capecitabine adherence with some efficiency. Manual review would likely be required to verify these results. The accuracy of using altered prescription refill dates as an adherence measure requires further studies.",14

"Ruxolitinib is a dual janus kinase 1 (JAK1)/JAK2 inhibitor used to treat splenomegaly and symptoms associated with myelofibrosis (MF). Current therapeutic options for symptomatic MF include supportive care, myelosuppressive therapy (such as hydroxycarbamide) and janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (in particular ruxolitinib). Allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only potentially curative treatment for MF, and younger transplant-eligible patients should still be considered for allogeneic stem cell transplantation; however, this is applicable only to a small proportion of patients. There is now increasing and extensive experience of the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib in MF, both in clinical trials and in 'real-world' practice. The drug has been shown to be of benefit in intermediate-1 risk patients with symptomatic splenomegaly or other MF-related symptoms, and higher risk disease. Optimal use of the drug is required to maximise clinical benefit, requiring an understanding of the balance between dose-dependent responses and dose-limiting toxicities. There is also increasing experience in the use of ruxolitinib in the pre-transplantation setting. This paper aims to utilise several 'real-life' cases to illustrate several strategies that may help to optimise clinical practice.",12
"A new approach of energy reclamation from mechanical vibrations is presented in this paper. The conversion from IF mechanical energy into electrical energy is achieved using piezoelectric materials. The originality of the proposed approach is based on a nonlinear treatment of the voltage delivered by a piezoelectric insert embedded in a vibrating structure. This nonlinear processing induces a strong increase of the power conversion capability of the piezoelectric insert. The theoretical principle of the nonlinear treatment is exposed, and the analytical model of an electrical generator a is developed. The results given by the model are compared to those of an experimental set-up. Experimental results C show that the extracted electrical energy may be increased beyond 400%.",52

"Preclinical molecular imaging is an emerging field. Improving the ability of scientists to study the molecular basis of human pathology in animals is of the utmost importance for future advances in all fields of human medicine. Moreover, the possibility of developing new imaging techniques or of implementing old ones adapted to the clinic is a significant area. Cardiology, neurology, immunology and oncology have all been studied with preclinical molecular imaging. The functional techniques of photoacoustic imaging (PAT), fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT), positron emission tomography (PET), and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in association with each other or with the ana-tomic reference provided by computed tomography (CT) as well as with anatomic and functional information provided by magnetic resonance (MR) have all been proficiently applied to animal models of human disease. All the above -mentioned imaging techniques have shown their ability to explore the molecular mechanisms involved in animal models of disease. The clinical translatability of most of the techniques motivates the ongoing study of their possible fields of application. The ability to combine two or more techniques allows obtaining as much information as possible on the molecular processes involved in pathologies, reducing the number of animals necessary in each experiment. Merging molecular probes compatible with various imaging technique will further expand the capability to achieve the best results.",33
"Dementia-friendly communities (DFCs) are a UK policy initiative that aims to enable people with dementia to feel supported and included within their local community. Current approaches to DFC creation rely on stakeholder involvement, often requiring volunteer assistance. There is though a lack of evidence that examines the reality of achieving this. This paper critically assesses the challenges and strategies for achieving stakeholder involvement in DFCs. The evidence base is drawn from an inter-agency project funded by the National Health Service in the South of England where seven DFCs were developed by steering group partners and four part-time project workers (PWs). Data from the independent evaluation undertaken in the first year (2013-2014) of the project were analysed: 14 semi-structured interviews and a focus group examined PWs' experiences; while progress and key milestones are determined from monthly progress forms, good news stories, locality steering group minutes and press releases. Analysis was undertaken using a directed content analysis method, whereby data content for each locality was matched to the analytical framework that was drawn from Alzheimer's Society guidance. Challenges to achieving stakeholder involvement were identified as: establishing networks and including people representative of the local community; involving people affected by dementia; and gaining commitment from organisations. Strategies for achieving stakeholder involvement were recognised as: a sustainable approach; spreading the word; and sharing of ideas. By highlighting these challenges and the approaches that have been used within communities to overcome them, these findings form the foundation for the creation of DFC initiatives that will become embedded within communities. Stakeholder involvement is unpredictable and changeable; therefore, reliance on this approach questions the long-term sustainability of DFCs, and must be considered in future policies designed to enhance quality of life for people affected by dementia.",119
"Togo Y, Otsuka T, Goto M, Furuse M, Yasuo S. Photoperiod regulates dietary preferences and energy metabolism in young developing Fischer 344 rats but not in same-age Wistar rats. Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab 303: E777-E786, 2012. First published July 17, 2012; doi:10.1152/ajpendo.00209.2012.-The effects of photoperiod on dietary preference were examined using young growing Fischer 344 and Wistar rats, which are seasonal and nonseasonal breeders, respectively. Rats were provided a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet (LFD: 66/10/24% energy as carbohydrate/fat/protein) and high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet (HFD: 21/55/24% energy as carbohydrate/fat/protein) simultaneously under long- (LD: 16 h light/day) and shortday (SD: 8 h light/day) conditions for 3 wk. Fischer 344 rats preferred the LFD to the HFD under the LD condition, whereas preference for both diets was equivalent under the SD condition. Consequently, their body weight and total energy intake exhibited 11-15 and 10-13% increases, respectively, under the LD condition. Calculation of energy intake from macronutrients revealed that rats under the LD condition consumed 20-24 and 9-13% higher energy of carbohydrates and proteins, respectively, than those under the SD condition. In contrast, Wistar rats preferred the LFD to the HFD irrespective of photoperiod and exhibited no photoperiodic changes in any parameters examined. Next, Fischer 344 rats were provided either the LFD or HFD for 3 wk under LD or SD conditions. Calorie intake was 10% higher in the rats fed the LFD than those fed the HFD under SD condition. However, rats under LD condition exhibited 5-10, 14, and 64% increases in body weight, epididymal fat mass, and plasma leptin levels, respectively, compared with those under the SD condition irrespective of dietary composition. In conclusion, photoperiod regulates feeding and energy metabolism in young growing Fischer 344 rats via the interactions with dietary macronutrient composition.",71
"Objective: The aim of the study was to understand the association between women's reproductive history and their risk of developing type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that characteristics signifying lower cumulative endogenous estrogen exposure would be associated with increased risk. Methods: Prospective cohort analysis of 124,379 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). We determined age of menarche and final menstrual period, and history of irregular menses from questionnaires at baseline, and calculated reproductive length from age of menarche and final menstrual period. Presence of new onset type 2 diabetes was from self-report. Using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, we assessed associations between reproductive variables and incidence of type 2 diabetes. Results: In age-adjusted models, women with the shortest (<30 y) reproductive periods had a 37% (95% CI, 30-45) greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes than women with medium-length reproductive periods (36-40 y). Women with the longest (45+ y) reproductive periods had a 23% (95% CI, 12-37) higher risk than women with medium-length periods. These associations were attenuated after full adjustment (HR 1.07 [1.01, 1.14] for shortest and HR 1.09 [0.99, 1.22] for longest, compared with medium duration). Those with a final menstrual period before age 45 and after age 55 had an increased risk of diabetes (HR 1.04; 95% CI, 0.99-1.09 and HR 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.14, respectively) compared to those with age of final menstrual period between 46 and 55 years. Timing of menarche and cycle regularity was not associated with risk after full adjustment. Conclusions: Reproductive history may be associated with type 2 diabetes risk. Women with shorter and longer reproductive periods may benefit from lifestyle counseling to prevent type 2 diabetes.",9
"Background: Respiratory morbidity in Australian Indigenous children is higher than their non-Indigenous counterparts, irrespective of urban or remote residence. There are limited studies addressing acute respiratory illness (ARI) in urban Indigenous children, particularly those that address the upper airway microbiome and its relationship to disease. We aimed to describe the prevalence of upper airway viruses and bacteria in symptomatic and asymptomatic urban-based Australian Indigenous children aged less than 5 years. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of data collected at baseline in an ongoing prospective cohort study of urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children registered with a primary health care service in the northern suburbs of Brisbane, Australia. Clinical, demographic and epidemiological data and bilateral anterior nasal swabs were collected on enrolment. Polymerase chain reaction was performed on nasal swabs to detect 17 respiratory viruses and 7 bacteria. The primary outcome was the prevalence of these microbes at enrolment. Logistic regression was performed to investigate differences in microbe prevalence between children with and without acute respiratory illness with cough as a symptom (ARIwC) at time of specimen collection. Results: Between February 2013 and October 2015, 164 children were enrolled. The median age at enrolment was 18. 0 months (IQR 7.2-34.3), 49.4% were boys and 56 children (34.2%) had ARIwC. Overall, 133/164 (81%) nasal swabs were positive for at least one organism; 131 (79.9%) for any bacteria, 59 (36.2%) for any virus and 57 (34.8%) for both viruses and bacteria. Co-detection of viruses and bacteria was more common in females than males (61.4% vs 38.6%, p = 0.044). No microbes, alone or in combination, were significantly associated with the presence of ARIwC. Conclusions: The prevalence of upper airways microbes in asymptomatic children is similar to non-Indigenous children with ARIwC from the same region. Determining the aetiology of ARIwC in this community is complicated by the high prevalence of multiple respiratory pathogens in the upper airways.",37
"ability to design metal forming processes requires knowledge of continuum mechanics and materials engineering. The papers presents the results of research on the complete analysis of the forging process of microalloyed steel. The forging process assessment was performed based on thermomechanical calculations and using microstructural modeling. Hardness tests were employed for the verification of computed results. A method of predicting the relation between quality of final product and history of metal forming as well as microstructural development using an FEM simulation is also presented here. The results of the FEM-simulation for the forging process and material are compared with experimental data to show the feasibility of the proposed method. Finally, it is stated that by using properly built software it is possible to eliminate brittle cracking in the forged products, especially at low temperatures.",89
"Background: Angioedema is a vascular reaction involving the lower dermis, subcutis and/or submucosal tissue and causing a temporary localized swelling in any part of the body. For many health care professionals, the diagnosis presents an ongoing challenge; several disorders may manifest with subcutaneous or submucosal swelling and falsely be assumed to be angioedema. The clinicians at the emergency department and in the immunology/allergy clinics must be skilled at recognizing the features of angioedema and its differential diagnosis. Methods: The review is based on a literature search with specific indexing terms in PubMed, a review of bibliographies and the authors' clinical experience. Results: The most essential diseases that mimic angioedema, the so-called pseudoangioedemas, will each be discussed and illustrated by clinical photos, pointing out key features that help clarify the diagnoses and differentiate these from classic angioedema. Conclusions: A variety of dermatologic conditions can cause swelling that resembles angioedema, some with a potentially fatal outcome if misdiagnosed. Knowledge of pseudoangioedema is fundamental in the emergency setting when handling patients with edema and should be kept in mind when assessing an atypical angioedema case. (C) 2016 S.

"Hadoop has become a widely used open source framework for large scale data processing. MapReduce is the core component of Hadoop. It is this programming paradigm that allows for massive scalability across hundreds or thousands of servers in a Hadoop cluster. It allows processing of extremely large video files or image files on data nodes. This can be used for implementing Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) algorithms on Hadoop to compare and match query images to the previously stored terabytes of an image descriptors databases. This work presents the implementation for one of the well-known CBIR algorithms called Scale Invariant Feature Transformation (SIFT) for image features extraction and matching using Hadoop platform. It gives focus on utilizing the parallelization capabilities of Hadoop MapReduce to enhance the CBIR performance and decrease data input\output operations through leveraging Partitioners and Combiners. Additionally, image processing and computer vision tools such as Hadoop Image Processing (HIPI) and Open Computer Vision (OpenCV) are integration is shown.",0
"Nanoscale electronic devices like field-effect transistors have long promised to provide sensitive, label-free detection of biomolecules. In particular, single-walled carbon nanotubes have the requisite sensitivity to detect single molecule events and sufficient bandwidth to directly monitor single molecule dynamics in real time. Recent measurements have demonstrated this premise by monitoring the dynamic, single-molecule processivity of three different enzymes: lysozyme, protein Kinase A, and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. In each case, recordings resolved detailed trajectories of tens of thousands of individual chemical events and provided excellent statistics for single-molecule events. This electronic technique has a temporal resolution approaching 1 microsecond, which provides a new window for observing brief, intermediate transition states. In addition, the devices are indefinitely stable, so that the same molecule can be observed for minutes and hours.

"This paper argues that mind-reading hypotheses (MRHs), of any kind, are not needed to best describe or best explain basic acts of social cognition. It considers the two most popular MRHs: one-ToM and two-ToM theories. These MRHs face competition in the form of complementary behaviour reading hypotheses (CBRHs). Following Buckner (Mind Lang 29: 566-589, 2014), it is argued that the best strategy for putting CBRHs out of play is to appeal to theoretical considerations about the psychosemantics of basic acts of social cognition. In particular, need-based accounts that satisfy a teleological criterion have the ability to put CBRHs out of play. Yet, against this backdrop, a new competitor for MRHs is revealed: mind minding hypothesis (MMHs). MMHs are capable of explaining all the known facts about basic forms of social cognition and they also satisfy the teleological criterion. In conclusion, some objections concerning the theoretical tenability of MMHs are addressed and prospects for further research are canvassed.",62
"The transcription factor encoded by the gene Knotted1 is a nuclear homeodomain protein, regulating meristematic cells at the shoot apical meristem. It has been demonstrated that Knotted1 (KN1) expression specifies stem cell fate in adventitious shoot induction in herbaceous plants. This gene may thus potentially identify the initiation of meristem development in adventitious shoot induction in difficult-to-regenerate plants such as Prunoideae. We isolated an almond (Prunus dulcis Mill.) KN1-type gene using degenerate primers targeting the most conserved regions of Knotted1 gene. The 5' and 3' ends of the isolated sequence were obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends-polymerase chain reaction (RACE-PCR), and the gene was named P. dulcis Knotted1-like (PdKn1). PdKn1 transcripts were detected by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR mainly in shoot apical and axillary meristems. The RT-PCR and RT-quantitative PCR PdKn1 expression in almond leaf explants was found to anticipate the organization of adventitious shoot meristems. Apricot RNA isolated from induced leaf explants cross-hybridized with the almond probe PdKn1 in Northern blotting. We suggest that almond PdKn1 may be a useful marker to study the adventitious regeneration system by revealing the potential organogenic conditions, not only in almond but also in other Prunoideae.",38
"The battery energy storage systems (BESSs) have been increasingly installed in the power system, especially with the growing penetration rate of the renewable energy sources. However, it is difficult for BESSs to be profitable due to high capital costs. In order to boost the economic value of BESSs, this paper proposes a hierarchical energy management system (HiEMS) to aggregate multiple BESSs, and to achieve multimarket business operations. The proposed HiEMS optimizes the multimarket bids considering a realistic BESS performance model, and coordinates the BESSs and manages their state of charge values, according to their price penalties based on dynamically generated annualized cost. By taking part in the energy market and regulation market at the same time, the cost-performance index (CPI) of the BESS aggregation is greatly improved. The impact of photovoltaic generation on system performance and CPI is also studied.",43
"A neglected tropical disease, melioidosis is known to have variability in clinical presentations. Here, we described clinical features that should alert the physicians on the possibility of melioidosis. In this review of 86 cases from 2001 to 2011, the common presentations of melioidosis in the Emergency Department (ED), Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia were; male gender (79.1 %), in working age group (47.8 +/- 15.2 year-old), worked in contact with soil (73.3 %), presented with fever (91.9 %), in rainy season (55.8 %), have underlying diabetes mellitus (79.1 %), have leukocytosis (67.4 %) and high blood glucose (62.8 %) during presentation. In 34.9 % of cases, the antimicrobials were initiated at the ED and only 10.5 % include antimelioid drugs. Thirty-one patients (36.0 %) died due to melioidosis and 51.6 % of this were within 48 h of admission. Despite high mortality rate, the clinical awareness on the possibility of melioidosis among emergency physicians is still low and need to be strengthened.",120
"This paper presents a phenomenographic analysis of perceptions of individuals with Asperger's syndrome in the Republic of Armenia. The primary objective was to apply and develop existing theory in a unique national context and across a broader respondent group than in previous studies. As such, the research compares and contrasts the views expressed by individuals with special educational needs and/or disabilities (SEN/D), the parents of individuals with SEN/D and lay members of the public. Social comparison models developed by Hedley and Young (2006), Huws and Jones (2015) and Locke (2014) are utilised as lenses through which to analyse the conceptions, attitudes and beliefs of each respondent group. The particular social, cultural and political history of Armenia offers an insight into the challenges of, and opportunities for, autism research in the former Soviet Union.",113
"Mothers, fathers, and siblings from 87 multiplex (M-mothers, M-fathers, and M-siblings) and 41 simplex (S-mothers, S-fathers, and S-siblings) Autism spectrum disorder families were assessed using the Broader Phenotype Autism Symptom Scale. S-mothers, S-fathers, and S-siblings showed more social interest and were more expressive in their use of nonverbal communication compared to M-mothers, M-fathers, and M-siblings. Conversational skills were also improved in S-fathers and S-siblings compared to M-fathers and M-siblings. S-siblings showed significantly lower rigidity and intense interests compared to M-siblings. The decreased number and intensity of broader autism phenotype traits observed in parents and siblings within simplex families provide behavioral evidence consistent with findings of increased de novo genetic events in simplex families.",64
"For the Green Village at the campus of Delft University of Technology, an autarkic water circuit was developed. The aim was to avoid connections to the public water supply system, the sewerage, the electricity grid and cable systems. It should produce its own drinking water and electricity, and clean its organic waste streams in a sustainable way. Due to the strict Dutch drinking water regulations, only one water quality will be supplied: drinking water. Drinking water will be produced from greywater (53%) supplemented with rainwater (47%). In the treatment scheme, the multiple barrier approach will be used to comply with the Dutch drinking water quality standards. For greywater treatment, a triple barrier is suggested: ozonation - ultrafiltration - UV disinfection. For rainwater treatment a dual barrier is suggested: ultrafiltration - UV disinfection. By separating wastewater streams at the point of origin into greywater and blackwater, and by replacing conventional toilets with low water consumption vacuum systems as part of the water conservation measures, it will be possible to collect a concentrated blackwater stream suitable for recovery energy. For this purpose the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor is suggested. The proposed water circuit results in an autarkic water management, but not in an autarkic energy management.",95
"This study considers linear precoding for secure transmission in a multiuser peer-to-peer relay network with finite alphabet input. Under the assumption that the global channel-state-information is available, the achievable secrecy rate is derived. However, the computational complexity to evaluate the achievable secrecy rate grows exponentially with respect to the number of pair users. To reduce the computational complexity caused by the multiuser interference, an accurate approximation of the achievable secrecy rate is derived. Based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker analysis, necessary conditions for the optimal precoder which maximises the approximated achievable secrecy rate are presented. In light of this, an iterative gradient method is developed to find the optimal precoder. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves significant gains in terms of the secrecy rate over schemes designed for Gaussian input.",46
"With the development of home area network, residents have the opportunity to schedule their power usage at the home by themselves aiming at reducing electricity expenses. Moreover, as renewable energy sources are deployed in home, an energy management system needs to consider both energy consumption and generation simultaneously to minimize the energy cost. In this paper, a smart home energy management model has been presented that considers both energy consumption and generation simultaneously. The proposed model arranges the household electrical and thermal appliances for operation such that the monetary expense of a customer is minimized based on the time-varying pricing model. In this model, the home gateway receives the electricity price information as well as the resident desired options in order to efficiently schedule the appliances and shave the peak as well. The scheduling approach is tested on a typical home including variety of home appliances, a small wind turbine, PV panel and a battery over a 24-h period. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"Introduction: Hypogonadism in men is often associated with poor libido, erectile dysfunction, irritability, fatigue, and psychological and relationship problems. Many of these symptoms can be best assessed through patient report. The 28-item Hypogonadism Impact of Symptoms Questionnaire (HIS-Q) was developed to evaluate hypogonadism symptoms in men with low testosterone in the context of clinical trials. Aim: To develop a briefer version of the HIS-Q that could be practical for use in treatment settings. Methods: Participants with low testosterone levels and symptoms consistent with hypogonadism were recruited through clinical sites. Focus groups and interviews were conducted to elicit symptom concepts and identify those that were most relevant to patients, including changes as a consequence of treatment. Main Outcome Measures: Systematic analysis of the qualitative data and expert clinician input were used to develop the HIS-Q short form (HIS-Q-SF). One-on-one cognitive interviews were conducted to confirm the content validity of the HIS-Q-SF. Results: Thirty-five men participated in this qualitative research. Concept elicitation was conducted through focus group discussions (n = 18) and telephone interviews (n = 2); then, the draft HIS-Q-SF was evaluated through cognitive interviews (n = 15). The mean age of total sample was 53.2 +/- 6.8 years, and the mean serum total testosterone level was 184.9 +/- 55.2 ng/dL. Results suggest that the HIS-Q-SF has demonstrated content validity, including the content coverage, comprehensibility, and the appropriateness of the response options and recall period. The final version of the HIS-Q-SF includes 17 items and is aligned with the original longer version of the instrument. Conclusion: The HIS-Q-SF is a comprehensive measurement of hypogonadism symptom severity in men. Content coverage and content validity were confirmed. The instrument will be evaluated further to establish the psychometric characteristics and to assess the utility of the measurement in clinical treatment settings. Copyright (C) 2016, The Authors.

"Purpose of reviewMicrobial dysbiosis is receiving increasing attention as possibly being important in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome. This review will summarize the most recent literature addressing attempts to explore and target the microbiome in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.Recent findingsManipulation of the intestinal microbiota in irritable bowel syndrome is receiving increasing attention. Traditionally, dietary manipulation has been utilized. There is now evidence that a low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols diet has not only been able to improve symptoms, but may have an effect on the gut microbiota. Probiotics are a safe and attractive option for the manipulation of the microbiota. There have been a number of well-designed trials examining the efficacy of certain strains of bacteria, and even yeasts are receiving attention. The role of antibiotics remains controversial and it seems likely that their use should currently be limited to those individuals with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Interest in the role of faecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of a number of gastrointestinal conditions has intensified and irritable bowel syndrome is no exception.SummaryThe manipulation of the microbial dysbiosis is gaining momentum. Further research, however, is required in order to identify the most appropriate treatment option for each individual patient.",4
"Breakthrough performances have been achieved in computer vision by utilizing deep neural networks. In this paper we propose to use random forest to classify image representations obtained by concatenating multiple layers of learned features of deep convolutional neural networks for scene classification. Specifically, we first use deep convolutional neural networks pre-trained on the large-scale image database Places to extract features from scene images. Then, we concatenate multiple layers of features of the deep neural networks as image representations. After that, we use random forest as the classifier for scene classification. Moreover, to reduce feature redundancy in image representations we derived a novel feature selection method for selecting features that are suitable for random forest classification. Extensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets, i.e. MIT-Indoor and UIUC-Sports. Obtained results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. The contributions of the paper are as follows. First, by extracting multiple layers of deep neural networks, we can explore more information of image contents for determining their categories. Second, we proposed a novel feature selection method that can be used to reduce redundancy in features obtained by deep neural networks for classification based on random forest. In particular, since deep learning methods can be used to augment expert systems by having the systems essentially training themselves, and the proposed framework is general, which can be easily extended to other intelligent systems that utilize deep learning methods, the proposed method provide a potential way for improving performances of other expert and intelligent systems.

The main aim of this cross-sectional study was to analyse the degree to which coping may act as a mediator between disability and psychosocial loss in people with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Participants (N=158) completed measures of psychosocial loss and ways of coping. Disability status was evaluated by attending neurologists. Coping partially mediated the relationship between disability and psychosocial loss. Disability leads to the experience of psychosocial loss but it is not the sole factor determining the formation of psychosocial loss. Coping is also associated with such losses in multiple sclerosis.,11
"This paper provides a brief introduction to CEOS theory, a comprehensive theory for understanding hard to maintain behaviour change. The name CEOS is an acronym for Context, Executive, and Operational Systems theory. Behaviour is theorised to be the result of the moment by moment interaction between internal needs (operational processes) in relation to environmental conditions, and for humans this is augmented by goal-directed, executive action which can transcend immediate contingencies. All behaviour is generated by operational processes. Goal-directed behaviours only triumph over contingency-generated competing behaviours when operational processes have been sufficiently activated to support them. Affective force can be generated around executive system (ES) goals from such things as memories of direct experience, vicarious experience, and emotionally charged communications mediated through stories the person generates. This paper makes some refinements and elaborations of the theory, particularly around the role of feelings, and of the importance of stories and scripts for facilitating executive action. It also sketches out how it reconceptualises a range of issues relevant to behaviour change. CEOS provides a framework for understanding the limitations of both informational and environmental approaches to behaviour change, the need for self-regulatory strategies and for taking into account more basic aspects of human functioning.",26
"Previous studies have suggested that real-time person perception relies on continuous competition, in which partially active categories smoothly compete over time. Here, two studies demonstrated the involvement of a different kind of competition. In Study 1, before participants selected the correct sex category for morphed faces, their mouse trajectories often exhibited a continuous attraction toward the incorrect category that increased with sex-category ambiguity, indicating continuous competition. On other trials, however, trajectories initially pursued the incorrect category and then abruptly redirected toward the correct category, suggesting early incorrect category activation that was rapidly reversed later in processing. These abrupt category reversals also increased with ambiguity. In Study 2, participants were presented with faces containing a sex-typical or sex-atypical hair cue, in a context in which the norm was either sex-typical targets (normative context) or sex-atypical targets (counternormative context). Sex-atypical targets induced greater competition in the normative context, but sex-typical targets induced greater competition in the counternormative context. Together, these results demonstrate that categorizing others involves both smooth competition and abrupt category shifts, and that these flexibly adapt to the social context.",63
"Purpose of review Dermatologic findings may be the first signs of a neonatal viral infection. This review provides an update of the diagnostic features and therapies for selected viral illnesses [herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus, enterovirus, and Zika virus] that present with cutaneous manifestations in the neonate. Recent findings HSV DNA polymerase chain reaction of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, routinely used in the diagnosis of neonatal HSV, may have expanded utility in assessing prognosis and acyclovir therapeutic efficacy. Maternal antiviral suppressive therapy may alter the clinical appearance of congenital HSV, resulting in delayed diagnosis and treatment. VariZIG, a varicella zoster immune globulin, is a US Food and Drug Administration approved form of prophylaxis for varicella. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has expanded the period of VariZIG eligibility for preterm infants, a group particularly susceptible to severe varicella infection. For severe neonatal enterovirus sepsis, the results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of pleconaril, a viral capsid inhibitor, suggest that this compound is an effective therapy. Human Parechovirus type 3, a strain within a newly formed viral genus, has a similar, and potentially underestimated, clinical presentation to enterovirus sepsis. However, a distinctive erythematous palmoplantar rash may be specific to human Parechovirus type 3 infection. Perinatal Zika virus infection in the neonate may present with a nonspecific macular and papular rash. As this rash is not specific, obtaining a maternal travel history and, if appropriate, requesting additional diagnostic testing are critical for early diagnosis. Summary Neonatal rashes may be harmless and transient, whereas others may reflect the presence of a severe systemic illness. Recognizing key cutaneous features of viral-associated rashes may aid in the prompt and accurate diagnosis and treatment of neonatal viral illnesses.",37
"Synthetic azo dyes with aromatic rings have become an important source of water pollution worldwide due to its high color, high toxicity and non biodegradability. In this study, Microbial fuel cell coupled constructed wetlands (CW-MFCs) were constructed for azo dye degradation. The performance of X-3B degradation, COD removal and electricity generation in the CW-MFCs were investigated. Experimental results showed that COD removal rate with co-substrate was consistently higher than that of without co-substrate, with the removal rates of 76.2% and 51.7%, respectively. X-3B removal efficiencies with different hydraulic retention time (HRT) (24, 48 and 72 h) were 19.7%, 39.1% and 84.7% without co substrate. The highest detected power density was 0.043 W m(-3) at the external resistance of 600 Omega. UVvis absorption spectra analyze indicated that the degradation of reactive brilliant red X-3B first occurred at the conjugation system, and later at the naphthalene rings and the benzene rings. The best X 3B degradation effect was achieved with additional co-substrate and longer HRT. However, the extension of HRT may affect the internal resistance on the contrary.",96
"Mycotoxins, the secondary metabolites of fungal species, are the most frequently occurring natural food contaminants in human and animal diets. Risk assessment of mycotoxins focused as yet on their mutagenic, genotoxic and potential carcinogenic effects. Recently, there is an increasing awareness of the adverse effects of various mycotoxins on vulnerable structures in the intestines. In particular, an impairment of the barrier function of the epithelial lining cells and the sealing tight junction proteins has been noted, as this could result in an increased translocation of luminal antigens and pathogens and an excessive activation of the immune system. The current review aims to provide a summary of the available evidence regarding direct effects of various mycotoxins on the intestinal epithelial barrier. Available data, based on different cellular and animal studies, show that food-associated exposure to certain mycotoxins, especially trichothecenes and patulin, affects the intestinal barrier integrity and can result in an increased translocation of harmful stressors. It is therefore hypothesized that human exposure to certain mycotoxins, particularly deoxynivalenol, as the major trichothecene, may play an important role in etiology of various chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, and in the prevalence of food allergies, particularly in children.",105
"The present study aimed to investigate the effects of mood stabilizers, specifically lithium (Li) and valproate (VPA), on the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in the brains of rats subjected to the ouabain (OUA)-induced animal model of mania. In addition, the effects of AR-A014418, a GSM-3 beta inhibitor, on manic-like behavior induced by OUA were evaluated. In the first experimental protocol Wistar rats received a single ICV injection of OUA or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). From the day following ICV injection, the rats were treated for 6 days with intraperitoneal injections of saline, Li or VPA twice a day. In the second experimental protocol, rats received OUA, aCSF, OUA plus AR-A014418, or aCSF plus AR-A014418. On the 7th day after OUA injection, locomotor activity was measured using the open-field test. In addition, we analyzed the levels of p-PI3K, p-MAPK, p-Akt, and p-GSK-3 beta in the brain of rats by immunoblot. Li and VPA reversed OUA-related hyperactivity. OUA decreased p-PI3K, p-Akt and p-GSK-3 beta levels. Li and VPA improved these OUA-induced cellular dysfunctions; however, the effects of the mood stabilizers were dependent on the protein and brain region analyzed. In addition, AR-A014418 reversed the manic-like behavior induced by OUA. These findings suggest that the manic-like effects of ouabain are associated with the activation of GSK-3 beta, and that Li and VPA exert protective effects against OUA-induced inhibition of the GSM-3 beta pathway.

"Many women with an elevated risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer have previously tested negative for pathogenic mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Among them, a subset has hereditary susceptibility to cancer and requires further testing. We sought to identify specific groups who remain at high risk and evaluate whether they should be offered multi-gene panel testing. We tested 300 women on a multi-gene panel who were previously enrolled in a long-term study at UCSF. As part of their long-term care, all previously tested negative for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 either by limited or comprehensive sequencing. Additionally, they met one of the following criteria: (i) personal history of bilateral breast cancer, (ii) personal history of breast cancer and a first or second degree relative with ovarian cancer, and (iii) personal history of ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal carcinoma. Across the three groups, 26 women (9%) had a total of 28 pathogenic mutations associated with hereditary cancer susceptibility, and 23 women (8%) had mutations in genes other than BRCA1 and BRCA2. Ashkenazi Jewish and Hispanic women had elevated pathogenic mutation rates. In addition, two women harbored pathogenic mutations in more than one hereditary predisposition gene. Among women at high risk of breast and ovarian cancer who have previously tested negative for pathogenic BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, we identified three groups of women who should be considered for subsequent multi-gene panel testing. The identification of women with multiple pathogenic mutations has important implications for family testing.",14
"A new state space approach is proposed to model the time-dependence in an extreme value process. The generalized extreme value distribution is extended to incorporate the time-dependence using a state space representation where the state variables either follow an autoregressive (AR) process or a moving average (MA) process with innovations arising from a Gumbel distribution. Using a Bayesian approach, an efficient algorithm is proposed to implement Markov chain Monte Carlo method where we exploit an accurate approximation of the Gumbel distribution by a ten-component mixture of normal distributions. The methodology is illustrated using extreme returns of daily stock data. The model is fitted to a monthly series of minimum returns and the empirical results support strong evidence of time-dependence among the observed minimum returns. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"Although dyslipidemia increases the risk for ischemic stroke, previous studies reported conflicting data regarding the association between lipid levels and stroke severity and outcome. To evaluate the predictive value of major lipids in patients with acute ischemic stroke. We prospectively studied 790 consecutive patients who were admitted with acute ischemic stroke (41.0 % males, age 79.4 +/- 6.8 years). The severity of stroke was assessed at admission with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Moderate/severe stroke was defined as NIHSS >= 5. The outcome was assessed with dependency rates at discharge (modified Rankin scale between 2 and 5) and with in-hospital mortality. Independent predictors of moderate/severe stroke were age (relative risk (RR) 1.05, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.08, p < 0.001), atrial fibrillation (RR 1.71, 95 % CI 1.19-2.47, p < 0.005), heart rate (RR 1.02, 95 % CI 1.01-1.04, p < 0.001), log-triglyceride (TG) levels (RR 0.24, 95 % CI 0.08-0.68, p < 0.01) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (RR 0.97, 95 % CI 0.95-0.98, p < 0.001). Major lipids did not predict dependency at discharge. Independent predictors of in-hospital mortality were atrial fibrillation (RR 2.35, 95 % CI 1.09-5.04, p < 0.05), diastolic blood pressure (RR 1.05, 95 % CI 1.02-1.08, p < 0.001), log-TG levels (RR 0.09, 95 % CI 0.01-0.87, p < 0.05) and NIHSS at admission (RR 1.19, 95 % CI 1.14-1.24, p < 0.001). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were not associated with stroke severity or outcome. Lower TG and HDL-C levels are associated with more severe stroke. Lower TG levels also appear to predict in-hospital mortality in patients with acute ischemic stroke.",111
"Since Eutrophication has become a serious water pollution problem on urban lake in China. Therefore, more accurate and efficient methods are necessary for water quality assessment. Although Bayesian methods are widely used in water quality modelling and uncertainty analyses, the algorithm efficiency often limits their application in multi-parameter eutrophication models. In this study, a genetic algorithm was integrated into a Bayesian method to improve sampling performance during the parameter calibration process. An eutrophication model of an urban lake in north China (Tianjin) is established based on biological processes and external loads. A Markov chain Monte Carlo method coupled with a genetic algorithm (MCMC-GA) is developed to sample the posterior parameter distributions and calculate the simulation results. Then, the performances of the MCMC-GA and classical MCMC are compared and analyzed. Finally, a water quality assessment is conducted for eutrophication management. The results are as follows: (1) the MCMC-GA displays a better convergence efficiency during parameter sampling, higher Markov chain quality, and narrower 95% upper and lower confidence intervals than the classical MCMC method; and (2) rainwater runoff nutrient loading must be controlled for urban lake restoration.

"The aim of this study was to improve thermal stability, mechanical, and surface properties of bisphenol A dicyanate ester (BADCy) with the addition of bisphenol P dicyanate ester (BPDCy) and colemanite. The cyanate esters (BADCy and BPDCy) were prepared from diphenol compound (bisphenol A or bisphenol P) and cyanogen bromide in the presence of triethylamine. The chemical structure of the synthesized cyanate esters was investigated by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-NMR and C-13-NMR) techniques. The cyanate esters/colemanite composites having various ratios of BADCy, BPDCy, and colemanite were prepared. Thermal stability of the samples was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. The samples were characterized with the following analyses: gel content, water absorption capacity, and stress-strain test. Hydrophobicity of the samples was determined by the contact angle measurements. Moreover, the surface morphology of the samples was investigated by a scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectrometer mapping. Finally, the obtained results prove that the prepared composites have good thermal, mechanical, and surface properties and that they can be used in many applications such as the electronic devices, materials engineering, and other emergent.",89
"Background. Fatigue is a common, persistent complaint following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Effective treatment is not well established. Objective. The current study aimed to investigate the efficacy of 4 weeks of light therapy for fatigue in patients with TBI. Methods. We undertook a randomized, placebo-controlled study of 4-week, 45 min/morning, home-based treatment with short wavelength (blue) light therapy ((max) = 465 nm, 84.8 mu W/cm(2), 39.5 lux, 1.74 x 10(14) photons/cm(2)/s) compared with yellow light therapy ((max) = 574 nm, 18.5 mu W/cm(2), 68 lux, 1.21 x 10(12) photons/cm(2)/s) containing less photons in the short wavelength range and a no treatment control group (n = 10 per group) in patients with TBI who self-reported fatigue and/or sleep disturbance. Assessments of fatigue and secondary outcomes (self-reported daytime sleepiness, depression, sleep quality, and sustained attention) were conducted over 10 weeks at baseline (week -2), midway through and at the end of light therapy (weeks 2 and 4), and 4 weeks following cessation of light therapy (week 8). Results. After controlling age, gender, and baseline depression, treatment with high-intensity blue light therapy resulted in reduced fatigue and daytime sleepiness during the treatment phase, with evidence of a trend toward baseline levels 4 weeks after treatment cessation. These changes were not observed with lower-intensity yellow light therapy or no treatment control conditions. There was also no significant treatment effect observed for self-reported depression or psychomotor vigilance performance. Conclusions. Blue light therapy appears to be effective in alleviating fatigue and daytime sleepiness following TBI and may offer a noninvasive, safe, and nonpharmacological alternative to current treatments.",71
"Using GPUs as general-purpose processors has revolutionized parallel computing by providing, for a large and growing set of algorithms, massive data-parallelization on desktop machines. An obstacle to their widespread adoption, however, is the difficulty of programming them and the low-level control of the hardware required to achieve good performance. This paper proposes a programming approach, SafeGPU, that aims to make GPU data-parallel operations accessible through high-level libraries for object-oriented languages, while maintaining the performance benefits of lower-level code. The approach provides data-parallel operations for collections that can be chained and combined to express compound computations, with data synchronization and device management all handled automatically. It also integrates the design-by-contract methodology, which increases confidence in functional program correctness by embedding executable specifications into the program text. We present a prototype of SafeGPU for Eiffel, and show that it leads to modular and concise code that is accessible for GPGPU non-experts, while still providing performance comparable with that of hand-written CUDA code. We also describe our first steps towards porting it to C#, highlighting some challenges, solutions, and insights for implementing the approach in different managed languages. Finally, we show that runtime contract-checking becomes feasible in SafeGPU, as the contracts can be executed on the GPU. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",101
"Objective Polymorphisms in ADAM33 gene have been implicated in susceptibility to the risk of childhood asthma. However, the results remain controversial. We performed meta-analyses to clarify the relationship between them. Methods Relevant articles were searched in PubMed, Embase, Wanfang, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure. The Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to assess the strength of the associations. Results Fourteen studies with five ADAM33 polymorphisms (F + 1, T1, T2, S2, and V4) were identified, involving 2687 cases and 2996 controls. ADAM33 F + 1, T2, and T1 polymorphisms showed significant associations with asthma risks in the overall and Caucasian children, Asian children, and Caucasian and Chinese children, respectively; however, these significant results were unstable in sensitivity analysis. T1 revealed significant and stable associations with asthma risks among Asian children in the dominant (OR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.40-2.87, P = 0.0002) and codominant (OR = 3.06, 95% CI = 1.71-5.50, P = 0.0002) models; in cumulative meta-analyses, these significant results were robust. Concerning S2 or V4 polymorphism, no significant associations were observed. Conclusion These findings demonstrate that ADAM33 T1 polymorphism might be a potential susceptible predictor of asthma for Asian children. Further functional studies between this polymorphism and asthma risks are warranted.",109
"Objective: Adolescents with conduct disorder (CD) are at high risk for developing adult antisocial personality disorder. However, the underlying neuropathophysiology of CD remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that the microstructure of white matter (WM) of males with CD may differ from that of healthy control subjects (HCs). Method: Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and quantitative tractography were used to assess WM microstructural differences between 36 teenaged boys with CD and 33 demographically matched HCs. Results: The CD group behavioral scale scores were significantly higher than those of the HCs on the Barratt Impulsivity Scale, the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire, and the Antisocial Process Screening Device total scales. TBSS revealed that, relative to HCs, the CD group had higher fractional anisotropy (FA) in the corpus callosum (CC) region, bilaterally, including the genu and body of the CC, as well as in some projection fibers in the region of the left anterior coronal radiate and right superior coronal radiate. Tractography confirmed higher FA of fibers passing through the regions with significant differences in the TBSS results. Exploratory analysis revealed that impulsivity associated positively with the FA of these fibers in the CD group. Conclusions: Maturation of WM microstructure in CD subjects differed from that in HCs, mainly in the CC. The abnormal maturation of WM structures may play an important role in the impulsivity and aggression of teenagers with CD.",73
"Secure parent-child attachment may help children to overcome the challenges of growing up with a visual or visual-and-intellectual impairment. A large literature exists that provides a blueprint for interventions that promote parental sensitivity and secure attachment. The Video-feedback Intervention to promote Positive Parenting (VIPP) is based on that blueprint. While it has been adapted to several specific at risk populations, children with visual impairment may require additional adjustments. This study aimed to identify the themes that should be addressed in adapting VIPP and similar interventions. A Delphi-consultation was conducted with 13 professionals in the field of visual impairment to select the themes for relationship-focused intervention. These themes informed a systematic literature search. Interaction, intersubjectivity, joint attention, exploration, play and specific behavior were the themes mentioned in the Delphi-group. Paired with visual impairment or vision disorders, infants or young children (and their parents) the search yielded 74 articles, making the six themes for intervention adaptation more specific and concrete. The rich literature on six visual impairment specific themes was dominated by the themes interaction, intersubjectivity, and joint attention. These themes need to be addressed in adapting intervention programs developed for other populations, such as VIPP which currently focuses on higher order constructs of sensitivity and attachment.",80
"The tongue is an elaborate complex of heterogeneous tissues with taste organs of diverse embryonic origins. The lingual taste organs are papillae, composed of an epithelium that includes specialized taste buds, the basal lamina, and a lamina propria core with matrix molecules, fibroblasts, nerves, and vessels. Because taste organs are dynamic in cell biology and sensory function, homeostasis requires tight regulation in specific compartments or niches. Recently, the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway has emerged as an essential regulator that maintains lingual taste papillae, taste bud and progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation, and neurophysiological function. Activating or suppressing Hh signaling, with genetic models or pharmacological agents used in cancer treatments, disrupts taste papilla and taste bud integrity and can eliminate responses from taste nerves to chemical stimuli but not to touch or temperature. Understanding Hh regulation of taste organ homeostasis contributes knowledge about the basic biology underlying taste disruptions in patients treated with Hh pathway inhibitors.",31
"A broadband graphene absorber with simple structure is proposed in this paper. The substrate used in this paper is 1.3 mm in thickness and constructed with 0.6 mm depth grooves periodically, which can be treated as substrates with a thickness of 1.3 mm and 0.7 mm arranging periodically. The combination of quartz substrate with different heights can realize the superposition of two adjacent frequency bands which leads to broad band characteristic of the absorber. The absorption rate of the absorber is obtained by software High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) 14.0. The relative bandwidth for the absorption rate above 90% is 27.1%, from 134 GHz to 176 GHz. The graphene absorber proposed has potential in the development of stealth technology.",98
"Reinforcement learning is an appealing approach for allowing robots to learn new tasks. Relevant literature reveals a plethora of methods, but at the same time makes clear the lack of implementations for dealing with real life challenges. Current expectations raise the demand for adaptable robots. We argue that, by employing model-based reinforcement learning, the-now limited-adaptability characteristics of robotic systems can be expanded. Also, model-based reinforcement learning exhibits advantages that makes it more applicable to real life use-cases compared to model-free methods. Thus, in this survey, model-based methods that have been applied in robotics are covered. We categorize them based on the derivation of an optimal policy, the definition of the returns function, the type of the transition model and the learned task. Finally, we discuss the applicability of model-based reinforcement learning approaches in new applications, taking into consideration the state of the art in both algorithms and hardware.",1
"Background: The 17-alpha-alkylated derivatives of testosterone are often used for the prevention of oedematous episodes in hereditary angioedema with C1-inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-HAE). However, these agents can have many adverse effects, including erythrocytosis and polyglobulia. Our aim was to investigate occurrence of erythrocytosis and polyglobulia after long-term danazol prophylaxis in C1-INH-HAE. Methods: During the initial stage of our retrospective study, we explored whether C1-INH-HAE is associated with susceptibility to erythrocytosis and/or polyglobulia. In the second stage, we analyzed the haematological parameters of 39 C1-INH-HAE patients before, as well as after treatment with danazol for 1, 3, or 5 years. In the third stage, we studied the incidence of erythrocytosis and of polyglobulia after dosing with danazol for more than 5 years. Results: We did not find any significant difference between C1-INH-HAE patients not receiving danazol and healthy controls as regards the occurrence of erythrocytosis or polyglobulia. The haematological parameters did not change after treatment with danazol for 1, 3, or 5 years. Platelet count was an exception-it decreased significantly (p = 0.0115) versus baseline, but within the reference range. Treatment-related polyglobulia did not occur. We observed erythrocytosis in a single female patient after 1-year-and in three female patients after more than 5-year long-treatment with danazol. Erythrocytosis did not require intervention or the discontinuation of danazol therapy. Conclusions: We conclude that neither erythrocytosis, nor polyglobulia occurs more often in C1-INH-HAE patients than in healthy individuals; it can be observed only sporadically even after treatment with danazol.",131
"This study investigated transactional pathways between organizational stressors and their underpinning situational properties, appraisals, coping, perceived coping effectiveness and performance satisfaction in athletes. Ten high-level field hockey players were interviewed. Data relating to stressors, situational properties, appraisals and coping were analysed using directed content analysis. Mean perceived coping effectiveness scores were calculated and subjective performance satisfaction data were categorized as satisfied, neutral or dissatisfied. A variety of organizational stressors was reported, which were underpinned by five situational properties. Challenge, threat and harm/loss appraisals were experienced and problem solving was the most commonly reported family of coping. High perceived coping effectiveness was not always associated with performance satisfaction. Performance satisfaction was, however, linked to the appraisal experienced. A battery of stress management techniques and ways of coping is useful for optimizing appraisals and alleviating negative outcomes of stress.",81
"Determination of conserved regions that plays vital roles on regulation of transcription and translation processes is one of the most challenging problems in bioinformatics. However, with the increasing power of distributed computing systems, solving these types of combinatorial problems by utilizing parallelized brute force or exhaustive search algorithms recently has gained popularity. In this paper, we investigated the parallelized implementation of a search tree based brute force technique to find motifs with different lengths. Experimental studies showed that parallelization of the brute force techniques with less communication overhead is significantly increased the usability of them to analyze long nucleotide sequences.",2
