"Background: The short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-sf) is a validated questionnaire used to assess physical activity (PA) in healthy adults and commonly used in both apparently healthy adults and cancer patients. However, the IPAQ-sf has not been previously validated in cancer patients undergoing oncologic treatment. The objective of the present study was to compare IPAQ-sf with objective measures of physical activity (PA) in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Methods: The present study was part of a 12-month prospective individualized lifestyle intervention focusing on diet, PA, stress management and smoking cessation in 100 cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. During the first two months of the lifestyle intervention, participants were wearing an activity monitor (SenseWear (TM) Armband (SWA)) for five consecutive days while receiving chemotherapy before completing the IPAQ-sf. From SWA, Moderate-to-Vigorous intensity PA (MVPA) in bouts >= 10 min was compared with self-reported MVPA from the IPAQ-sf. Analyses both included and excluded walking in MVPA from the IPAQ-sf. Results were extrapolated to a wearing time of seven days. Results: Sixty-six patients completed IPAQ-sf and wore the SWA over five days. Mean difference and limit of agreement between the IPAQ-sf and SWA including walking was 662 (+/- 1719) min. wk(-1). When analyzing time spent in the different intensity levels separately, IPAQ-sf reported significantly higher levels of moderate (602 min. wk(-1), p = 0.001) and vigorous (60 min. wk(-1), p = 0.001) PA compared to SWA. Conclusions: Cancer patients participating in a lifestyle intervention during chemotherapy reported 366 % higher MVPA level from the past seven days using IPAQ-sf compared to objective measures. The IPAQ-sf appears insufficient when assessing PA level in cancer patients undergoing oncologic treatment. Activity monitors or other objective tools should alternatively be considered, when assessing PA in this population.",29
"All modern governments are concerned with population and its management; they pursue a variety of policies in order to deal with demographic conditions adequately. One of the countries that seriously adopted population policies-especially birth control policy-in the late 20th century is Iran. Different studies stress that the population growth policy in the first half of the 1980s and the population control policy in the late 1980s and 1990s in Iran were influenced by the predicament the country found itself in during the war with Iraq and after the war, as well as the necessity of population management to renew human resources during the war and perform development and reconstruction plans properly after the war. This study claims that adopting such policies has not been due to a full understanding of real situations, but largely has been influenced by meta-forces i.e. political and ideological discourses that governed the country. In fact governing discourses actually determine the policies and their courses, rather than changes in policy-makers' understanding of real conditions in the society. This study indicates that since the Islamic Revolution, different discourses, including Islamic Idealism, Islamic Pragmatism, Islamic realism and Principlism, have governed Iran; consequently different population policies consistent with these discourses have been followed. In other words, this study tries to show that discursive attitudes seem to account more adequately for population policies in Iran than positivistic attitudes.",116
"This paper presents an innovative approach based on hardware and software to develop a multichannel seismic monitoring and data acquisition embedded system. The hardware was designed by using basic electronic components and integrated circuits. It consists of two parts, signal processing and microcontroller circuits. The signal processing circuit is a combination of preamplifier, low-pass filter, gain control, high-pass filter, dc offset, and clipper circuits. The proposed data acquisition system is able to record data at a sampling rate of 300 mu s, with 10-bit resolution. It has three modes: real-time monitoring, continuous recording, and seismic refraction. The detected seismic signals were filtered using analog filters, which are low pass with 1 kHz and high pass with 2 Hz. A universal serial bus was utilized to communicate between the hardware and the personal computer. A graphical user interface based on windows operating system was developed using Microsoft. NET Framework for transferring, processing, and analyzing the data. The system was tested and experimental results showing the performance of the proposed system were presented. Earth scientists can use this system for educational seismic experiments. It can be easily modified and used for other engineering applications.",51
"Nucleophosmin (NPM) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (Her-2) are abnormally expressed in various types of human malignant tumors, including gastric cancer, and have been closely associated with cancer chemoresistance. However, their interaction and roles in oxaliplatin resistance are not fully understood. Therefore, the present study aimed to elucidate the relationship between NPM and Her-2 in gastric cancer cell lines and clinical samples, and further investigated their role in the resistance of gastric cancer to oxaliplatin. Western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction confirmed that NPM and Her-2 expression were significantly upregulated in gastric cancer cells and clinical samples, and that their expression levels were strongly correlated. However, Her-2 expression was not affected by upregulation or downregulation of NPM expression in gastric cancer cells. Cell counting kit-8 assays demonstrated that the cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin decreased simultaneously with an increase in NPM expression. Furthermore, inhibition of Her-2 expression using trastuzumab significantly increased the sensitivity of the cells to oxaliplatin, which occurred simultaneously with the downregulation of NPM. These results indicated that inhibition of NPM, as a Her-2 downstream signal, may be a novel strategy to overcome oxaliplatin-resistant gastric cancer, and that trastuzumab and oxaliplatin may exhibit a synergistic antitumor effect in Her-2-positive gastric cancer cells.",37
The present research is aimed at analyzing the professional gestures of a museum educator in a specific situation: the demonstration of the Foucault Pendulum in the Arts et Metiers Museum in Paris. What professional gestures can give him the ability to present this object to a mixed audience in a museum space open to visitor circulation? How does he manage to capture the attention of his audience and make scientific knowledge accessible? Does the educator work like a teacher? Such are the questions that the research team had in mind and which allowed them to conceive the scientific museum educator's action from the point of view of professional gestures.,80
"Introduction The aim of this study was to evaluate results of surgical stabilisation of hyperextension injuries of the thoracolumbar spine in patients with ankylosing spinal disorders using two different treatment strategies: the conventional open rigid posterior instrumentation and percutaneous less rigid posterior instrumentation. Surgical and non-surgical complications, the postoperative radiological course, and clinical outcome at final follow-up were comparatively assessed. Moreover, we sought to discuss important biomechanical and surgical aspects specific to posterior instrumentation of the ankylosed thoracolumbar spine as well as to elaborate on the advantages and limitations of the proposed new treatment strategy involving percutaneous less rigid stabilisation and fracture reduction by postoperative mobilisation. Materials and methods Between January 2006 and June 2012, a consecutive series of 20 patients were included in the study. Posterior instrumentation was performed either using an open approach with rigid 6.0 mm bars (open rigid (OR) group) or via a percutaneous approach using softer 5.5 mm bars (percutaneous less rigid (PLR) group). Complications as well as the radiological course were retrospectively assessed, and patient outcome was evaluated at final follow-up using validated outcome scores (VAS Spine Score, ODI, RMDQ, Parker Mobility Score, Barthel Score and WHOQOL-BREF). Results Surgical complications occurred more frequently in the OR group requiring revision surgery in two patients,while there was no revision surgery in the PLR group. The rate of postoperative complications was lower in the PLR group as well (0.7 vs. 1.3 complications per patient, respectively). Fracture reduction and restoration of pre-injury sagittal alignment by postoperative mobilisation occurred within the first 3 weeks in the PLR group, and within 6 months in the OR group. The clinical outcome at final follow-up was very good in both groups with no relevant loss in VAS Spine Score (pain and function), Parker Mobility Score (mobility), and Barthel Index (social independency) compared to pre-operative values. Conclusions This study indicates that the proposed treatment concept involving percutaneous less rigid posterior instrumentation and fracture reduction by postoperative mobilisation is feasible, seems to facilitate adequate reduction and restoration of pre-injury sagittal alignment, and might have the potential to reduce the rate of complications in the management of hyperextension injuries of the ankylosed thoracolumbar spine.",107
"Since the introduction of SPICE non-linear controlled voltage and current sources, they have become a central feature in the interactive development of behavioural device models and circuit macromodels. The current generation of SPICE-based open source general public license circuit simulators, including Qucs, Ngspice and Xyce (c), implements a range of mathematical operators and functions for modelling physical phenomena and system performance. The Qucs equation-defined device is an extension of the SPICE style non-linear B type controlled source which adds dynamic charge properties to behavioural sources, allowing for example, voltage and current dependent capacitance to be easily modelled. Following, the standardization of Verilog-A, it has become a preferred hardware description language where analogue models are written in a netlist format combined with more general computer programming features for sequencing and controlling model operation. In traditional circuit simulation, the generation of a Verilog-A model from a schematic, with embedded non-linear behavioural sources, is not automatic but is normally undertaken manually. This paper introduces a new approach to the generation of Verilog-A compact device models from Qucs circuit schematics using a purpose built analogue module synthesizer. To illustrate the properties and use of the Qucs Verilog-A module synthesiser, the text includes a number of semiconductor device modelling examples and in some cases compares their simulation performance with conventional behavioural device models.

"Both historical clinical and recent preclinical data suggest that the M-1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor is an exciting target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and the cognitive and negative symptom clusters in schizophrenia; however, early drug discovery efforts targeting the orthosteric binding site have failed to afford selective M-1 activation. Efforts then shifted to focus on selective activation of M-1 via either allosteric agonists or positive allosteric modulators (PAMs). While M-1 PAMs have robust efficacy in rodent models, some chemotypes can induce cholinergic adverse effects (AEs) that could limit their clinical utility. Here, we report studies aimed at understanding the subtle structural and pharmacological nuances that differentiate efficacy from adverse effect liability within an indole-based series of M-1 ago-PAMs. Our data demonstrate that closely related M-1 PAMs can display striking differences in their in vivo activities, especially their propensities to induce adverse effects. We report the discovery of a novel PAM in this series that is devoid of observable adverse effect liability. Interestingly, the molecular pharmacology profile of this novel PAM is similar to that of a representative M-1 PAM that induces severe AEs. For instance, both compounds are potent ago-PAMs that demonstrate significant interaction with the orthosteric site (either bitopic or negative cooperativity). However, there are subtle differences in efficacies of the compounds at potentiating M-1 responses, agonist potencies, and abilities to induce receptor internalization. While these differences may contribute to the differential in vivo profiles of these compounds, the in vitro differences are relatively subtle,and highlight the complexities of allosteric modulators and the need to focus on in vivo phenotypic screening to identify safe and effective M-1 PAMs.",72
"This study investigated the perspective of international patients on individual symptoms of atopic dermatitis (eczema) in determining treatment response. A questionnaire was developed to evaluate the importance of symptoms from the patient's perspective. Patients were asked: ""How important are these features in deciding whether or not a treatment is working?"", and rated symptoms on a 5-point Likert scale. Patients were approached via Harmonising Outcome Measures for Eczema (HOME) collaborators and self-selected to take part in the on-line survey. Patients from 34 countries (n = 1,111) completed the survey; of these, 423 (38.3%) were parents of children with eczema. Ten items were rated as being ""quite important"" or ""very important"" by more than 80% of the respondents: itch, pain/soreness, skin feels hot or inflamed, bleeding, involvement of visible or sensitive body sites, cracks, sleep difficulties, amount of body affected, and weeping/oozing. These results may be of use in determining the face validity of scales from a cross-cultural patients' perspective.",110
"This paper proposes a new operation and control strategy for Power-Assisted Wheelchairs (PAW) using one brushless DC (BLDC) motor. The conventional electrical wheelchairs are too heavy and large for one person to move because they have two electric motor wheels. On the other hand, the proposed PAW system has a small volume and is easy to move due to the presence of a single wheel motor. Unlike the conventional electric wheelchairs, this structure for a PAW does not have a control joystick to reduce its weight and volume. To control the wheelchair without a joystick, a special control system and algorithm are needed for proper operation of the wheelchair. In the proposed PAW system uses only one sensor to detect the acceleration and direction of PAW's movement. By using this sensor, speed control can be achieved. With a speed control system, there are three kinds of operations that can be done on the speed of a PAW: the increment of PAW speed by summing external force, the decrement of PAW speed by subtracting external force, and emergency breaking by evaluating the time duration of external force. The validity of the proposed algorithm is verified through experimental results.",53
"Being a powerful instrument for modelling, analysing, and simulating dynamic systems, Petri Nets have been used many times in the past to solve software engineering problems and to model different aspects of information system. However, none of these research attempts have succeeded in modelling complete information system's behaviour in formal and executable way, at the same time. In the field of requirement specification and modelling of the information systems, it is usual to find object-oriented (OO) methodologies (UML) instead of some formal methods such as Petri Nets. In this paper, we propose a model based on extension of Petri Nets for creating formal static and dynamic models of information systems. The proposed model was designed as an executable replacement of the UML dynamic diagrams. For modelling static structure of the system we still suggest using OO methods, but proposed Petri Nets extension provides complete integration of the OO static elements into Petri Nets used as a dynamic model. The main contribution of the proposed Petri Nets extension is that we get the formal model that is, unlike other known formal models, directly and completely executable. More precisely, we created a model of a Petri Net that represents real information system with all its functionalities. Moreover, we created a CASE tool that allows modelling and execution of a system using the proposed model.",123
"A new mathematical formula referred to as the Planckian distribution equation (PDE) has been found to fit long-tailed histograms generated in various fields of studies, ranging from atomic physics to single-molecule enzymology, cell biology, brain neurobiology, glottometrics, econophysics, and to cosmology. PDE can be derived from a Gaussian-like equation (GLE) by non-linearly transforming its variable, x, while keeping the y coordinate constant. Assuming that GLE represents a random distribution (due to its symmetry), it is possible to define a binary logarithm of the ratio between the areas under the curves of PDE and GLE as a measure of the non-randomness (or order) underlying the biophysicochemical processes generating long-tailed histograms that fit PDE. This new function has been named the Planckian information, IP, which (i) may be a new measure of order that can be applied widely to both natural and human sciences and (ii) can serve as the opposite of the Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy, S, which is a measure of disorder. The possible rationales for the universality of PDE may include (i) the universality of the wave-particle duality embedded in PDE, (ii) the selection of subsets of random processes (thereby breaking the symmetry of GLE) as the basic mechanism of generating order, organization, and function, and (iii) the quantity-quality complementarity as the connection between PDE and Peircean semiotics.",36
"This research aimed to determine the effect of food insecurity on sexual HIV risk with clients among youth sex workers (YSWs) < 30 years in Metro Vancouver, Canada. Data were drawn from a prospective community cohort of sex workers (2010-2013). We examined the independent relationship between YSWs' food insecurity and being pressured into sex without a condom by clients (""client condom refusal""). Of 220 YSWs, 34.5 % (n = 76) reported client condom refusal over the 3.5-year study period and 76.4 % (n = 168) reported any food insecurity. Adjusting for other HIV risk pathways, food insecurity retained an independent effect on client condom refusal (AOR 2.08, 95 % CI 1.23-3.51), suggesting that food insecurity is significantly associated with HIV risk among YSWs. This study indicates a critical relationship between food insecurity and HIV risk, and demonstrates YSWs' particular vulnerability. Public policies for food assistance as a harm reduction measure may be key to addressing this disparity.",132
"Interest on the enrichment of eggs and poultry meat with omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FA) has increased given their important role in human metabolism. The inclusion of n-3 FA into eggs and poultry meat is achieved by feeding ingredients such as flaxseed, fish oil, fish meal, marine algae and canola to birds. However, problems in various production parameters and sensory quality of eggs and meat may arise. The former possibly caused by antinutritional and physiological effects and the latter influenced by the interaction of volatile substances. Possible increases in formulation costs also deserve attention. Strategies to ameliorate these undesirable effects include limiting the inclusion levels of n-3 FA sources, time of feeding, mixing different n-3 FA sources in commercial rations, and including high levels of vitamin E along with high-quality ingredients. A mild heat treatment may eliminate some of the drawbacks of feeding flaxseed to birds.",32
"Cell division is a fascinating and fundamental process that sustains life. By this process, unicellular organisms reproduce and multicellular organisms sustain development, growth, and tissue repair. Division of a mother cell gives rise to two daughter cells according to an ordered set of events within four successive phases called G1 (gap1), S (DNA S ynthesis), G2 (gap2), and M (Mitosis) phase. How these different phases are orchestrated to ensure the physical separation of the two daughter cells is a tightly regulated process. Indeed, inappropriate cell division could lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and ultimately to cancer. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an excellent model system for unraveling the secrets of cell division. A large community of researchers has chosen budding yeast as a model because of its advantages: rapid growth in simple and economical media, tractable genetics, powerful biochemistry, cell biology, and proteomics approaches. Furthermore, the cell cycle mechanisms, as elucidated in yeast, are conserved in higher eukaryotes. The ability to synchronize and get large numbers of cells in a particular stage of the cell cycle is crucial to properly explore the mechanisms of the cell cycle. An overview of the most common yeast synchronization techniques has been compiled in this chapter.",31
"Any useful object is commonly made from selected engineering materials with proper shape and dimension. The selection of materials and manufacturing processes is an important criterion towards the production of useable and affordable objects. The technologies behind this knowledge are needed to acquire through study, proper education, practical training and scientific research related to Materials and Manufacturing Engineering (MME). Allah (swt), the sources of all power and knowledge, has bestowed the Guide Book, the Holy Qur'an through His beloved Messenger Prophet Mohammad (pbuh) to the mankind. Allah (swt) narrated various stories in many Surahs of the noble Qur'an related to applied science and technology. This paper is an attempt to view the integration between the revealed knowledge and the science and technology based knowledge related to engineering materials and manufacturing processes. Finally, stresses have been given to acquire knowledge on science and technology based education and understanding, and disseminate it for the cause of humanity.",84
"The international contest has strongly influenced the historiography of demographic policies in Romania, Bulgaria and the former Yugoslavia. Before 1989, national regimes justified their severe birth control policies as necessary to the productive system and their healthcare. At the time, most Western scholars considered this an expression of an attempt to extend a widespread control over all aspects of society. The peculiarity of the demographic policy of Yugoslavia, which was far more liberal than those of Romania and Bulgaria, was considered proof of the heterodoxy of its regime. The end of Cold War and the dramatic events of the Nineties in the former Yugoslavia fostered the development of a new, domestic historiography, which actively supported the policies of population growth promoted in the region, and particularly in Serbia. On the contrary, with the exception of some anthropological and sociological works, interest has declined for what concerns many of the states of the former Soviet bloc.",116
"A framework for developing a product involving manufacturing processes was developed with integrated computational materials engineering approach. The key component in the framework is a process modeling tool which includes a thermal model, a microstructure model, a thermo-mechanical, and a property model. Using friction stir welding (FSW) process as an example, development of the process modeling tool was introduced in detail. The thermal model and the microstructure model of FSW of steels were validated with the experiment data. The model can predict reasonable temperature and hardness distributions as observed in the experiment. The model was applied to predict residual stress and joint strength of a pipe girth weld.",89
"A wide-swing optical modulator driver is implemented in 0.13-mu m SiGe-BiCMOS using a three-stage distributed amplifier with a digital input line. Measurements demonstrate 6-Vp-p differential output, symmetric 6-ps (min) rise/fall times, 333-fs (rms) additive jitter, and better than 20-dB output return loss (S-11) below 58 GHz. Full output swing with adjustable (6-12 ps) rise/fall times is realized after a three-step calibration sequence facilitated by an on-chip energy detector and digital control. The circuit supports 28-48-Gb/s external data sources, or 2(11) -1 PRBS and 1-0 internal data generators for calibration and characterization respectively. The 3-mm(2) driver IC (1.8-mm(2) active area) consumes 1.92 W from + 5/-2.5-V supplies.",48
"Intranasal infection with vaccine strain of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (TC83) caused persistent viral infection in the brains of mice without functional a beta T-cells (a beta-TCR -/-). Remarkably, viral kinetics, host response gene transcripts and symptomatic disease are similar between a beta-TCR -/- and wild-type C57BL/6 (WT) mice during acute phase of infection [0-13 days post-infection (dpi)]. While WT mice clear infectious virus in the brain by 13 dpi, a beta-TCR -/- maintain infectious virus in the brain to 92 dpi. Persistent brain infection in a beta-TCR -/- correlated with inflammatory infiltrates and elevated cytokine protein levels in the brain at later time points. Persistent brain infection of a beta-TCR -/- mice provides a novel model to study prolonged alphaviral infection as well as the effects and biomarkers of long-term viral inflammation in the brain.",33
"Glazing transmittance variation with clearness index has higher influence than incident angle for soar energy application. This work presents variation of vacuum glazing transmittance with clearness index. Clearness index and transmittance was calculated from measured one year (2014) solar radiation and glazing transmittance data in Dublin, Ireland. Clearness index below 0.5 offer single value of transmittance whereas above 0.5 clearness index glazing transmittance varies with clearness index. For different azimuthal orientation, clearness index associated with vertical plane glazing transmittance has been proposed. In Dublin for south facing vertical plane, vacuum glazing has 35% transmittance below 0.5 clearness index. Yearly usable single transmitted solar energy and solar heat gain coefficient for vertical plane south facing vacuum glazing are 87 W/m(2) and 0.22 respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"It is well known that multipath effect remains a dominant error source that affects the positioning accuracy of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers. Significant efforts have been made by researchers and receiver manufacturers to mitigate multipath error in the past decades. Recently, a multipath mitigation technique using dual-polarization antennas has become a research hotspot for it provides another degree of freedom to distinguish the line-of-sight (LOS) signal from the LOS and multipath composite signal without extensively increasing the complexity of the receiver. Numbers of multipath mitigation techniques using dual-polarization antennas have been proposed and all of them report performance improvement over the single-polarization methods. However, due to the unpredictability of multipath, multipath mitigation techniques based on dual-polarization are not always effective while few studies discuss the condition under which the multipath mitigation using a dual-polarization antenna can outperform that using a single-polarization antenna, which is a fundamental question for dual-polarization multipath mitigation (DPMM) and the design of multipath mitigation algorithms. In this paper we analyze the characteristics of the signal received by a dual-polarization antenna and use the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to assess the theoretical performance of DPMM in different received signal cases. Based on the assessment we answer this fundamental question and find the dual-polarization antenna's capability in mitigating short delay multipath-the most challenging one among all types of multipath for the majority of the multipath mitigation techniques. Considering these effective conditions, we propose a dual-polarization sequential iterative maximum likelihood estimation (DP-SIMLE) algorithm for DPMM. The simulation results verify our theory and show superior performance of the proposed DP-SIMLE algorithm over the traditional one using only an RHCP antenna.",35
"In this paper, a new CMOS four-quadrant analog multiplier circuit is proposed, based on a pair of dual-translinear loops. The significant features of the circuit are its high accuracy and high linearity as well as its body effect-free operation, owing to the fact that the circuit relies on a new dual-translinear topology. In addition, harmonic distortions are precisely discussed due to their conceivable mismatches, including transconductance and threshold voltage of the transistors. HSPICE postlayout simulation results are presented to verify the validity of the theoretical analysis, where under a supply voltage of 2.8 V, the bandwidth of the proposed multiplier is 137 MHz, and the corresponding maximum linearity error remains as low as 1.12%. Moreover, the power dissipation of the proposed circuit is found to be 521 mu W. The presented multiplier is expected to be useful in the design of various analog signal processing applications such as modulators and frequency doublers, as illustrated in this paper.",52
"Bringing quantum science and technology to the space frontier offers exciting prospects for both fundamental physics and applications such as long-range secure communication and space-borne quantum probes for inertial sensing with enhanced accuracy and sensitivity. But despite important terrestrial pathfinding precursors on common microgravity platforms and promising proposals to exploit the significant advantages of space quantum missions, large-scale quantum test beds in space are yet to be realised due to the high costs and lead times of traditional Big Space' satellite development. But the small space' revolution, spearheaded by the rise of nanosatellites such as CubeSats, is an opportunity to greatly accelerate the progress of quantum space missions by providing easy and affordable access to space and encouraging agile development. We review space quantum science and technology, CubeSats and their rapidly developing capabilities and how they can be used to advance quantum satellite systems.",57
"Objective The purpose of this study was to have an overview of the current approach to psoriatic arthritis (PsA) by a group of Italian rheumatologists. Methods Rheumatologists from all around Italy were asked to participate in a survey to give their opinion on a number of statements made by a panel of rheumatologists who are experts in PsA. The survey was conducted through two rounds using a Delphi-like method. The two rounds yielded a consensus on the management of PsA. Results Fifty rheumatologist from 50 rheumatology centres participated in the survey. Of the 117 proposed statements, only 10 did not reach the 66% concordance threshold. The main results of the survey were that diagnosis of PsA should be made using both the CASPAR criteria and clinical judgment, that all of the features of the psoriatic disease are relevant in the assessment and therapy of PsA, that treatment recommendations are taken into account, that all of the available biological agents may be used in bio-naive patients, that anti-drug antibody testing is still not used in daily practice, that both switching or swapping are useful options in the case of bio-failure because of lack or loss of efficacy, and that swapping is considered the best choice in the case of bio-failure due to adverse events. Conclusion The results of this survey showed that a comprehensive evaluation of the patient and a therapy choice based on both patient clinical features and evidence of drug efficacy and safety are considered the current best of care for PsA patients.",22
"The pre-mRNA of the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1) is subject to exon skipping and alternative splice site selection, which can generate up to 12 isoforms. The expression and function of these variants in vivo has not yet been fully explored. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of Fmr1 exon 12 and exon 15 isoforms. Exon 12 encodes an extension of KH2 domain, one of the RNA binding domains in the FMR1 gene product (FMRP) and we show that exon 12 variant proteins differentially interact with kissing complex RNA. Alternative splicing at exon 15 produces FMRPs differing in RNA binding ability and each is distinguished by unique post-translational modifications. Using semiquantitative RT-PCR and Northern blotting, we found that particular Fmr1 exon 12 and exon 15 isoforms change during neuronal differentiation. Interestingly, Fmr1 exon 12 variants display tissue-specific and developmental differences, while exon 15-containing transcripts vary less. Altogether, the spatio-temporal plasticity of FMR1 mRNA is consistent with complex RNA processing that is mis-regulated in fragile X syndrome. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",38
"Similarly to inorganic memristors, the organic memristive devices reveal a variation of the hysteresis loop upon the frequency of the applied bias voltage. The on/off ratio of the conductivity increases from 4 to 1000 Limes for the variation of time delay (equilibration after the application of the voltage increment) from 5 to 60 s. Being implemented in multi-element electrical circuits memristive devices provide a cross-talk, leading to an equilibration trend of the conductivity values. This effect is mainly related to the formation of stable signal pathways. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",45
"Background The aim of this study was to compile nationally representative statistics describing inpatient hospital care for patients with work-related injuries and illnesses covered under workers' compensation (WC) insurance in the United States. Methods Three years of data (1997-1999)from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) were used to describe WC inpatient stays with respect to patient and hospital characteristics, principal diagnoses, number and type of procedures provided, total charges, length of stay, and time from admission to administering of the principal procedure. Results Approximately 209,139 WC hospitalizations occurred annually, representing 0.62% of all inpatient admissions. The average total charge per WC hospitalization was $14,966. After adjusting for the type of diagnosis and other factors, WC hospital care was found to involve 13-24% more procedures, have a slightly longer (4%) length of stay, and take 23-54% less time from admission to the principal procedure than inpatient care for comparable diagnoses paid by other sources. Inpatient care for disc and spinal disorders paid by WC had 16% higher charges than similar non-WC cases. Three-year trends showed a steady decline in the number of WC hospitalizations between 1997 and 1999 but a sharp 16% rise in total charges per WC stay. Conclusions This research provides an initial foundation for understanding the extent and nature of hospitalized care for injured workers in the US and identifying significant trends in the delivery of care.

"Renal fibrosis is a progressive pathological change characterized by tubular cell apoptosis, tubulointerstitial fibroblast proliferation, and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). miR-21 has been implicated in transforming growth factor- (TGF-)-stimulated tissue fibrosis. Recent studies showed that sphingosine kinase/sphingosine-1-phosphate (SphK/S1P) are also critical for TGF--stimulated tissue fibrosis; however, it is not clear whether SphK/S1P interacts with miR-21 or not. In this study, we hypothesized that SphK/S1P signaling is linked to upregulation of miR-21 by TGF-. To verify this hypothesis, we first determined that miR-21 was highly expressed in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) stimulated with TGF- by using qRT-PCR and Northern blotting. Simultaneously, inhibition of miR-21, mediated by the corresponding antimir, markedly decreased the expression and deposition of type I collagen, fibronectin (Fn), cysteine-rich protein 61 (CCN1), -smooth muscle actin, and fibroblast-specific protein1 in TGF--treated TECs. ELISA and qRT-PCR were used to measure the S1P and SphK1 levels in TECs. S1P production was induced by TGF- through activation of SphK1. Furthermore, it was observed that TGF--stimulated upregulation of miR-21 was abolished by SphK1 siRNA and was restored by the addition of exogenous S1P. Blocking S1PR(2) also inhibited upregulation of miR-21. Additionally, miR-21 overexpression attenuated the repression of TGF--stimulated ECM deposition and epithelial-mesenchymal transition by SphK1 and S1PR(2) siRNA. In summary, our study demonstrates a link between SphK1/S1P and TGF--induced miR-21 in renal TECs and may represent a novel therapeutic target in renal fibrosis.",38
"Salinity is an adverse environmental stress that limits the yield and quality of maize. As one of the most important osmolytes present in higher plants, glycinebetaine helps stabilize metabolism in plant cells and protects the constituents of cells from damage. In this study, a gene from Atriplex micrantha that encodes betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase was introduced by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation into maize inbred lines Zheng58 and Qi319 under the control of the maize ubiquitin promoter. Putative transgenic plants were confirmed by PCR and Southern blotting analysis. The transgenic maize plants expressed higher amounts of betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase activity and also grew better than the WT plants under NaCl stress. Compared with the wild type, the transgenic plants had increased fresh weight, lower malondialdehyde content, lower relative electrical conductivity, higher chlorophyll content, taller plant height, and higher grain yield under salt stress, which indicated that the expression of BADH gene in maize seedlings enhanced the salt tolerance of these plants.",39
"Background: The mechanism of T(H)2/T(H)17-predominant and T(H)2/T(H)17-low asthma is unknown. Objective: We sought to study the immune mechanism of T(H)2/T(H)17-predominant and T(H)2/T(H)17-low asthma. Methods: In a previously reported cohort of 60 asthmatic patients, 16 patients were immunophenotyped withT(H)2/T(H)17-predominant asthma and 22 patients with T(H)2/T(H)17-low asthma. We examined bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid leukocytes, cytokines, mediators, and epithelial cell function for these asthma subgroups. Results: Patients with T(H)2/T(H)17-predominant asthma had increased IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-23, C3a, and serum amyloid A levels in BAL fluid, and these correlated with IL-1 beta and C3a levels. T(H)2/T(H)17 cells expressed higher levels of the IL-1 receptor and phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist protein, inhibited BALT(H)2/T(H)17 cell counts. T(H)2/T(H)17-low asthma had 2 distinct subgroups: neutrophilic asthma (45%) and pauci-inflammatory asthma (55%). This contrasted with patients with T(H)2/T(H)17-predominant and T(H)2-predominant asthma, which included neutrophilic asthma in 6% and 0% of patients, respectively. BAL fluid neutrophils strongly correlated with BAL fluid myeloperoxidase, IL-8, IL-1a, IL-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and GM-CSF levels. Sixty percent of the patients with neutrophilic asthma had a pathogenic microorganism in BAL culture, which suggested a subclinical infection. Conclusion: We uncovered a critical role for the IL-1 beta pathway in patients with T(H)2/T(H)17-predminant asthma. A subgroup of patients with T(H)2/T(H)17-low asthma had neutrophilic asthma and increased BAL fluid IL-1 alpha, IL-6, IL-8, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and GM-CSF levels. IL-1 alpha was directly involved in IL-8 production and likely contributed to neutrophilic asthma. Sixty percent of neutrophilic patients had a subclinical infection.",109
"ObjectivesTo determine whether there are racial and ethnicity group differences in Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health (REACH II) intervention delivery. DesignRandomized controlled trial. SettingCommunity-based intervention delivered at five sites across the United States. ParticipantsFamily caregivers of persons with dementia who were randomized to the active intervention condition (N = 323). InterventionNine in-home sessions (90 minutes each) and three telephone sessions (30 minutes each) were intended to be delivered and designed to reduce caregiver burden and depression, improve caregiver self-care and social support, and help caregivers manage behavior problems in persons with dementia. MeasurementsInterventionists recorded the type of intervention (home or telephone), start and stop times, and whether specific intervention content modules (e.g., stress management, social support) were administered in each session. ResultsOverall, REACH II intervention delivery was high, with more than 80% of randomized caregivers completing at least five in-home sessions and receiving eight or more hours of intervention contact, but black caregivers completed fewer in-home sessions (mean 6.98) than Hispanics (mean 7.84) or whites (mean 8.25) and received less total intervention contact time (mean 683 minutes) than Hispanics (mean 842 minutes) or whites (mean 798 minutes). No significant differences in exposure to content according to race or ethnicity were found after controlling for demographic covariates. ConclusionBlacks in REACH II received significantly less intervention contact. Similar multicomponent interventions should examine whether there are systematic differences in intervention delivery across specific demographic subgroups and explore implications for treatment outcomes.",29
"Background: Basophil activation tests (BATs) have promise for research and for clinical monitoring of patients with allergies. However, BAT protocols vary in blood anticoagulant used and temperature and time of storage before testing, complicating comparisons of results from various studies. Objective: We attempted to establish a BAT protocol that would permit analysis of blood within 24 hours of obtaining the sample. Methods: Blood from 46 healthy donors and 120 patients with peanut allergy was collected into EDTA or heparin tubes, and samples were stored at 4 degrees C or room temperature for 4 or 24 hours before performing BATs. Results: Stimulation with anti-IgE or IL-3 resulted in strong upregulation of basophil CD203c in samples collected in EDTA or heparin, stored at 4 degrees C, and analyzed 24 hours after sample collection. However, a CD63(hi) population of basophils was not observed in any conditions in EDTA-treated samples unless exogenous calcium/magnesium was added at the time of antiIgE stimulation. By contrast, blood samples collected in heparin tubes were adequate for quantification of upregulation of basophil CD203c and identification of a population of CD63 hi basophils, irrespective of whether the specimens were analyzed by means of conventional flow cytometry or cytometry by time-of- flight mass spectrometry, and such tests could be performed after blood was stored for 24 hours at 4 degrees C. Conclusion: BATs to measure upregulation of basophil CD203c and induction of a CD63 hi basophil population can be conducted with blood obtained in heparin tubes and stored at 4 degrees C for 24 hours.",105
"Progress in biomechanical modelling of human soft tissue is the basis for the development of new clinical applications capable of improving the diagnosis and treatment of some diseases (e.g. cancer), as well as the surgical planning and guidance of some interventions. The finite element method (FEM) is one of the most popular techniques used to predict the deformation of the human soft tissue due to its high accuracy. However, FEM has an associated high computational cost, which makes it difficult its integration in real-time computer-aided surgery systems. An alternative for simulating the mechanical behaviour of human organs in real time comes from the use of machine learning (ML) techniques, which are much faster than FEM. This paper assesses the feasibility of ML methods for modelling the biomechanical behaviour of the human liver during the breathing process, which is crucial for guiding surgeons during interventions where it is critical to track this deformation (e.g. some specific kind of biopsies) or for the accurate application of radiotherapy dose to liver tumours. For this purpose, different ML regression models were investigated, including three tree-based methods (decision trees, random forests and extremely randomised trees) and other two simpler regression techniques (dummy model and linear regression). In order to build and validate the ML models, a labelled data set was constructed from modelling the deformation of eight ex-vivo human livers using FEM. The best prediction performance was obtained using extremely randomised trees, with a mean error of 0.07 mm and all the samples with an error under 1 mm. The achieved results lay the foundation for the future development of some real-time software capable of simulating the human liver deformation during the breathing process during clinical interventions.

"Magnesium is an essential chemical element in all organisms, intervening in most cellular enzymatic reactions; thus, its importance in homeostasis and as a therapeutic tool in highly challenging patients such as pediatrics. The primary purpose of this paper was to review the role of magnesium sulfate as an adjuvant drug in pediatric anesthesia. This compound already has the scientific backing in certain aspects such as analgesia or muscle relaxation, but only theoretical or empirical backing in others such as organ protection or inflammation, where it seems to be promising. The multitude of potential applications in pediatric anesthesia, its high safety, and low cost make magnesium sulfate could be considered a Super Adjuvant.",109
"This paper presents the development of a fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) system for use with a diesel internal combustion engine (ICE) valve train. A novel feature is generated for each of the valve closing and combustion impacts. Deformed valve spring faults and abnormal valve clearance faults were seeded on a diesel engine instrumented with one accelerometer. Five classification methods were implemented experimentally and compared. The FDD system using the Naive-Bayes classification method produced the best overall performance, with a lowest detection accuracy (DA) of 99.95% and a lowest classification accuracy (CA) of 99.95% for the spring faults occurring on individual valves. The lowest DA and CA values for multiple faults occurring simultaneously were 99.95% and 92.45%, respectively. The DA and CA results demonstrate the accuracy of our FDD system for diesel ICE valve train fault scenarios not previously addressed in the literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",87
"Background: Mothers In Motion (MIM), a randomized controlled trial, aimed to help young, low- income overweight and obese mothers prevent weight gain by promoting stress management, healthy eating, and physical activity. This paper describes MIM recruitment challenges and reports demographic characteristics affecting enrollment. Methods: Participants who were African American or Non- Hispanic White were recruited from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) in Michigan. We faced numerous recruitment challenges and learned that several strategies facilitated recruitment. Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine demographic characteristics that affect enrollment. Results: Women who had a higher body mass index (BMI, OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.10); were at late postpartum, (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.10-1.40), were breastfeeding (OR 5.0, 95% CI 2.34-10.65); or were at early postpartum and breastfeeding (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.22-0.81) were more likely to enroll than their counterparts. Compared to African American women, Non- Hispanic White women were more likely to enroll (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.29-2.42). Also, women who were non- smokers (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.40-0.73) or had a higher education were more likely to enroll (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.04-1.42) than those who smoked or had a lower education. Conclusion: Future lifestyle behavioral intervention studies for similar target audiences may consider tailoring their recruitment messages based on relevant participant demographic characteristics identified as potential determinants of enrollment in this study.

"Natural killer cells (NK cells) are traditionally attributed to the innate immune system. It is considered that previously received stimuli have little effect on the functioning of these immune cells. Indeed, NK cells even without prior sensitization provide a rapid effector response against tumor, virus-infected, or otherwise damaged cells. They have a limited repertoire of receptors, the expression of which does not require somatic recombination. However, recent data indicate that NK cells may acquire the properties specific to adaptive immune cells. In particular, NK cells have been shown to possess the features of immunological memory, namely, the ability to more quickly and effectively respond to a repeated stimulus. The mechanisms of memory acquisition in NK cells differ from those implemented in T and B lymphocytes and are still rather vague. Presumably, some of these mechanisms underlie the significant phenotypic and functional NK cell diversity emerging during their differentiation. The recent data accumulated in this area considerably change the existing immunology paradigm, which postulates a clear delineation of the adaptive and innate immune cells. The published data on phenotypic and functional characteristics of NK cells and particular changes in these characteristics during NK cell differentiation and generation of memory-like NK cells are reviewed.",33
"Background: Ocular allergy is a growing public health problem that greatly impacts the day-to-day life of sufferers and their families. Other aspects of their activities of daily living such as schooling, professional, and social life are affected hence an increased awareness and knowledge of ocular allergies, their detection and treatment is paramount. This study was to assess the level of knowledge and awareness of ocular allergy among undergraduate students of public universities in Ghana. Methods: A descriptive cross sectional survey was conducted among 1000 students from three selected public universities in Ghana. Each respondent completed a questionnaire that had questions concerning awareness and knowledge of ocular allergy. Results: Out of the 1000 students, 347 (34.7 %) were aware of ocular allergy. Of these 347 students, the level of knowledge of ocular allergy was generally low. Majority of the students had their source of information about ocular allergy from the media and the internet. There was statistical significant association among awareness of ocular allergy, sources of information and programme of study (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Level of awareness among university students is generally low. Students' programmes of study influenced their knowledge of ocular allergy. Public health measures are recommended to help educate students on the prevention and control of ocular allergy as well as the complications associated with this condition.",105
"Australian education service provision includes the delivery of quality educational programmes to rural and remote living children. However, according to their parents, many children with developmental disabilities (such as Down Syndrome and Autism Spectrum Disorders) who are living in rural country areas in New South Wales (NSW) still do not have access to an acceptable education programme. This study aimed to use quality of life factors via a family quality of life scale to explore 51 parents' experience of educational service provision for their children with developmental disabilities in rural NSW. The results indicated that successful engagement with the school system is strongly affected by the views, assumptions, expertise and prejudices of teaching and care professionals. Further research into how local educational service providers may assist rural Australian families with a child with IDD in rural and remote locations is warranted.",113
"The transparent plates (such as organic glass, plastic plate) are widely used in the construction industry, high-tech products and scientific research applications, and its parallelism and uniformity measurement in the manufacture and quality control become more and more inevitable. Interferometer is a label-free, high-precision, and high-efficient device that can be used in many fields. According to a single-element interferometer, we demonstrate a measurement for the parallelism and uniformity of transparent medium. Beam-splitter cube is a key component. Half of plane wave laser source passes through the measured medium and the remaining half directly passes through the air, then these two halves with different optical paths meet in the beam-splitter cube. The parallelism or uniformity is determined by calculating interference fringe shift number during rotating the measured sample. The coherent beam is divided into two parts by a beam-splitter, one passes through the lens and then arrives at a photoelectric counter, and the other arrives at the observation plane of the charge-coupled device. The photoelectric counter is used to count the integer part of fringe shift number during rotating the sample; and the decimal part can be detected by calculating the phase difference of the two interferograms captured before and after rotation. The measurement principle of the proposed device is analyzed in detail, and the numerical simulations of the fringe shift number and the gray level changing with the sample rotation angle, the thickness and the refractive index of the sample are carried out. The simulation results show that the bigger the rotation angle, thickness and refractive index of the sample, the greater the fringe shift number will be. Therefore, the measurement accuracy can be improved by increasing the rotation angle and the thickness of the sample. In addition, we also simulate the measurement processes of two kinds of samples, which are unparallel and inhomogeneous transparent plates. The simulation results prove the feasibility and high accuracy of the proposed method. Finally, the optical experiment is conducted to demonstrate the practicability of the present device. The parallelism of a cuvette used for more than one year, is tested by our device. The results show that the difference in thickness between the cuvettes is on a micron scale, the peak-valley (PV) value is 9.92 mu m, and the root mean square (RMS) value is 2.2 mu m. And the difference between the contrast test results and the results from the proposed method is very small, the PV value is 0.569 mu m, and the RMS value is 0.131 mu m. The stability and repeatability of the proposed setup are tested in the experimental condition. The mean value and standard deviation of the fringe shift number during 30 min are 0.0012 and 0.0008, respectively. These results further testify the high accuracy and stability of our method. In conclusion, the performance of our measurement method is demonstrated with numerical simulation and optical experiment.",90
"The case study presented in this paper aimed at discovering opportunities for ambient intelligence and new interaction methods for a future remote crane-operating environment. The theoretical objective was to carry out an experience-driven research project in an industrial work context, and the practical objective was to create and evaluate a future-oriented science fiction prototype. The work was carried out in close co-operation with an industrial partner who was a domain expert in the field of crane industry. The aim was to focus on clearly defined user experience goals to which the industrial partner committed. The consequent immediate objective was to focus on two explicit experiences relating to 'Feeling of being motivated' and to 'Sense of community' that were placed at the core of the design investigations. These experiences were deliberated into a science fiction prototype entitled 'Remote operator's day in a future control center'. The science fiction prototype was further introduced to users by twofold means: as a plain, simple short story and through an interactive experience path. The main contribution of the paper is to demonstrate how an emerging technology research of a new domain may employ science fiction prototyping method as a primary means of experience design investigations.",92

"Fluidic artificial muscles are popular in robotics and function as biomimetic actuators. Their pneumatic version has been widely investigated. A novel water hydraulic artificial muscle (WHAM) with high strength is developed in this study. WHAMs can be applied to underwater manipulators widely used in ocean development because of their environment-friendly characteristics, high force-to-weight ratio, and good bio-imitability. Therefore, the strength of WHAMs has been improved to fit the requirements of underwater environments and the work pressure of water hydraulic components. However, understanding the mechanical behaviors of WHAMs is necessary because WHAMs use work media and pressure control that are different from those used by pneumatic artificial muscles. This paper presents the static and dynamic characteristics of the WHAM system, including the water hydraulic pressure control circuit. A test system is designed and built to analyze the drive characteristics of the developed WHAM. The theoretical relationships among the amount of contraction, pressure, and output drawing force of the WHAM are tested and verified. A linearized transfer function is proposed, and the dynamic characteristics of the WHAM are investigated through simulation and inertia load experiments. Simulation results agree with the experimental results and show that the proposed model can be applied to the control of WHAM actuators.",83
"The physiological and developmental effects of thyroid hormones are mainly due to the control of gene expression after interaction of T-3 with the nuclear receptors. To understand the role of thyroid hormones on cerebral cortex development, knowledge of the genes regulated by T-3 during specific stages of development is required. In our laboratory, we previously identified genes regulated by T-3 in primary cerebrocortical cells in culture. By comparing these data with transcriptomics of purified cell types from the developing cortex, the cellular targets of T-3 can be identified. In addition, many of the genes regulated transcriptionally by T-3 have defined roles in cortex development, from which the role of T-3 can be derived. This review analyzes the specific roles of T-3-regulated genes in the different stages of cortex development within the physiological frame of the developmental changes of thyroid hormones and receptor concentrations in the human cerebral cortex during fetal development. These data indicate an increase in the sensitivity to T-3 during the second trimester of fetal development. The main cellular targets of T-3 appear to be the Cajal-Retzius and the subplate neurons. On the other hand, T-3 regulates transcriptionally genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins, involved in cell migration and the control of diverse signaling pathways.",133
"This paper describes ImAtHome, an iOS application for smart home configuration and management. This application has been built over the framework HomeKit, made available in iOS, for communicating with and controlling home automation accessories. Attention has been put on the design of the interaction with such an application, in order to make the interaction style as much coherent as possible with iOS apps and supporting users without programming skills to unwittingly create event-condition action rules that, in other similar systems, are usually defined through ""if-then"" constructs. The results of a user test demonstrate that ImAtHome is easy to use and well accepted by end users of different age and background.",92
"Intracellular delivery of a functional gene or a nucleic acid sequence to specifically knockdown a harmful gene is a potential approach to precisely treat a critical human disease. The intensive efforts in the last few decades led to the development of a number of viral and non-viral synthetic vectors. However, an ideal delivery tool in terms of the safety and efficacy has yet to be established. Recently, we have developed pH-sensing inorganic nanocrystals of carbonate apatite for efficient and cell-targeted delivery of gene and gene-silencing RNA. Here we show that addition of very low level of fluoride to the particle-forming medium facilitates a robust increase in transgene expression following post-incubation of the particles with HeLa cells. Confocal microscopic observation and Southern blotting prove the cytoplasmic existence of plasmid DNA delivered by likely formed fluoridated carbonate apatite particles while degradation of plasmid DNA presumably by cytoplasmic nucleases was noticed following delivery with apatite particles alone. The beneficial role of fluoride in enhancing carbonate apatite-mediated gene expression might be due to the buffering potential of generated fluoridated apatite in endosomal acidic environment, thereby increasing the half-life of delivered plasmid DNA.

"The present study was aimed to verify if body weight could influence self-perception, in terms of body image, mood states, dissatisfaction with physical appearance and risk of eating disorders. In particular, we evaluated the differences between women of normal weight vs. overweight and obese during the delicate phase of puerperium to verify if there were different emotional structures, linked to BMI. Thirty-two women, 16 normal-weight and 16 overweight or obese, belonging to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of the University Hospital, were individually interviewed. The Body Uneasiness Test (BUT), the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) and the Profile of Mood States (POMS) were used for the evaluation. Findings showed that the BMI in puerperium is significantly correlated to mood states and body perception. Furthermore, significant differences emerged in eating attitudes and behaviours, in specific aspects related to the weight gain phobia and the body shape perception, symptoms classically associated with the risk of developing an eating disorder.",67
"There has been an immense endeavor to mitigate global warming in spite of which it has only been worse. This paper presents the design and implementation of a low power and eco-friendly refrigeration system using the thermoelectric effect. The conventional refrigerators make use of complex mechanisms which involves synchronous operation of various units, namely the compressor, condensers, expansion valves, evaporator, refrigerant and so on. But a thermoelectric refrigerator exploits the principle of the Peltier effect, thus avoiding the utilization of these complex components. This even helps curb the release of harmful chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) into the atmosphere which contributes to the increase in global temperature. Moreover, the temperature can be controlled and set to required values with the help of a microcontroller. Hence, this can be used both for domestic and commercial purposes. The unit does not eject any harmful gases. Therefore, the heat expelled from the unit can be tapped for heating utilities, making the use of this device versatile in its application. Thus this proposal aims not only at reducing the air pollutants by not contributing to it but also at reducing the power consumption.",51
"Background: Patients with chronic illnesses are often required to take lifelong medication to alleviate symptoms and prevent disease progression. Many patients find it difficult to adhere to prescribed medication for various reasons, some of which may link to the way they conceptualise medicines and understand their illness and treatment. This study explores the medicine taking behaviours of patients presenting with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease. We focused particularly on patients' conceptualisation and understanding of medicines within this disease context, against a backdrop of scarce healthcare resources. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 female patients at a rheumatology clinic in South Africa, as well as a review of participants' medical records. We conducted a secondary analysis of the data using thematic analysis and framework analysis principles. Results: Participants reported a range of medicine taking behaviours including self-medicating, adding complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) or traditional remedies, and sometimes acquiring prescribed medicines illegally. Participants provided insights into their understanding of what constitutes a medicine and what substances can be added to a prescribed regimen, which impacted on adherence. Importantly, the majority of participants demonstrated poor understanding of their illness, medications, regimens and dosage instructions. Conclusions: Medicine taking in the context of RA, within the studied demographic, is complex and appears strongly mediated by individual and contextual factors. Poor patient understanding, individual conceptualisation of medicines and medicine taking, and the availability of a range of additional medicines and remedies impact on adherence. Based on these findings, we make some suggestions for how healthcare providers can play a greater role in educating patients living with RA about medicines, CAM and traditional remedies, as well as medicine taking behaviours.",132
"In water treatment, flocculation creates aggregated particles or flocs large enough to be removed by downstream processes of sedimentation and filtration. Fluidized beds of flocs (floc blankets) are sometimes included in upflow sedimentation processes because they can significantly improve sedimentation tank particle removal when plate or tube settlers are used. Overall performance of a sedimentation tank containing a floc blanket is influenced by the characteristics of incoming flocs fromthe flocculator. Floc blankets provide an additional opportunity for aggregation of colloidal particles that enables a reduction in the size of the flocculators, while improving particle removal efficiency. In this study, laminar flow flocculators varying in velocity gradient (G) and residence time (theta) were tested in a laboratory scale water treatment systemwith a floc blanket. Results indicate that increasing G (range of 74-251 s(-1)), while decreasing residence time from 269 to 80 s, and maintaining a constant G theta (similar to 20,000) improved particle removal. These results indicate that velocity gradients greater than existing design recommendations may be used to reduce flocculator residence times (and associated construction costs) when upflow sedimentation with a floc blanket and overlying lamellar plate or tube settlers are employed subsequent to flocculation. Further reduction of the residence time to 24 s with a G of 251 s(-1) resulted in a settled water turbidity of 14 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU). When varying theta at a constant G of 72 s(-1), an apparentminimum in settled effluent turbidity at 0.15 NTU was observed at the middle residence time tested (theta = 211 s), suggesting that long hydraulic flocculator residence times may be suboptimal.",86
"Objectives: The impact of wearing lenses on visual and musculoskeletal complaints in VDU workers is currently unknown. The goal of this study was 1) to evaluate the impact of wearing VDU lenses on visual fatigue and self-reported neck pain and disability, compared to progressive lenses, and 2) to measure the effect of both lenses on head inclination and pressure pain thresholds during the performance of a VDU task. Methods: Thirty-five eligible subjects were randomly assigned to wear progressive VDU lenses (VDU group) (n = 18) or progressive lenses (P group) (n = 17). They were enquired about visual complaints (VFQ), self-perceived pain (NRS) and disability (NDI) at baseline (with old lenses), and 1 week, 3 months and 6 months after wearing their new lenses. In addition, Forward Head Angle (FHA) and PPTs were assessed during and after a VDU task before and 6 months after wearing the new lenses. A short questionnaire concerning the satisfaction about the study lenses was completed at the end of the study. Results: In both groups, visual fatigue and neck pain was decreased at 3 and 6 months follow up, compared to baseline. All PPTs were higher during the second VDU task, independent of the type of lenses. The VDU group reported a significantly higher suitability of the lenses for VDU work. Conclusion: It can be concluded that there is little difference in effect of the different lenses on visual and musculoskeletal comfort. Lenses should be adjusted to the task-specific needs and habits of the participant.",0
"Linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) implies that crack-like flaws would intensify stress in brittle materials with stress intensity scaling up with the square root of the crack size. Therefore, the apparent strength of materials tends to be much smaller than the theoretical value. In this paper, we examine the stress state in nacreous composites and find that in such materials the crack-induced stress intensification and its dependence on crack size can be suppressed greatly. This feature of nacreous composites can be attributed to the unique ""brick-and-mortar"" (B-and-M) structure and a synergistic match of the mechanical properties between ""brick"" (e.g. minerals) and ""mortar"" (e.g. proteins) phases. Our findings not only provide a fundamental insight into the origin of the excellent mechanical properties of nacreous composites such as high strength, high toughness and flaw tolerance, but also will be of great value to the design and synthesis of new structural materials for superior mechanical properties.

"Group call is a major service in TETRA (Terrestrial Trunked Radio) networks, and there are some cases where group call conflict occurs. This paper presents a method to resolve group call conflict by merging the users requesting to initiate an existing group call into the ongoing call. In addition, this paper also comes up with a method to shorten the call set-up time by setting a time delay between call clear and channel release when the same group call is initiated frequently, and by these means user experience and system performance are improved. The state machine design and process design are described in details. The experimental test result proven the effectiveness of our method.",85
"Background: Patients with Ph-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), such as polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), are at increased risk for thrombosis/thromboembolism and major bleeding. Due to the morbidity and mortality of these events, antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant agents are commonly employed as primary and/or secondary prophylaxis. On the other hand, disease-related bleeding complications (i.e., from esophageal varices) are common in patients with MPN. This analysis was performed to define the frequency of such events, identify risk factors, and assess antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy in a cohort of patients with MPN. Methods: The MPN registry of the Study Alliance Leukemia is a non-interventional prospective study including adult patients with an MPN according to WHO criteria (2008). For statistical analysis, descriptive methods and tests for significant differences as well as contingency tables were used to identify the odds of potential risk factors for vascular events. Results: MPN subgroups significantly differed in sex distribution, age at diagnosis, blood counts, LDH levels, JAK2V617F positivity, and spleen size (length). While most thromboembolic events occurred around the time of MPN diagnosis, one third of these events occurred after that date. Splanchnic vein thrombosis was most frequent in post-PV-MF and MPN-U patients. The chance of developing a thromboembolic event was significantly elevated if patients suffered from post-PV-MF (OR 3.43; 95 % CI = 1.39-8.48) and splenomegaly (OR 1.76; 95 % CI = 1.15-2.71). Significant odds for major bleeding were previous thromboembolic events (OR = 2.71; 95 % CI = 1.36-5.40), splenomegaly (OR = 2.22; 95 % CI 1.01-4.89), and the administration of heparin (OR = 5.64; 95 % CI = 1.84-17.34). Major bleeding episodes were significantly less frequent in ET patients compared to other MPN subgroups. Conclusions: Together, this report on an unselected ""real-world"" cohort of German MPN patients reveals important data on the prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment of thromboembolic and major bleeding complications of MPN.",20
"Emergence of new professions and novel approaches to work contribute to newer causes of occupational stress. The current study focuses on one such emergent group namely, the software development professionals. An attempt has been made to examine the role of self-efficacy, collective efficacy and perception of control in the study of occupational stress. The data was collected from 156 software development professionals in India. Variables such as self-efficacy, collective efficacy and perception of control using multiple moderated regression revealed that these variables moderate the negative consequences of stress with respect to work exhaustion, organizational commitment and intent to turnover but not with respect to job satisfaction. The results indicate that self-efficacy and collective efficacy have to be strengthened in order to mitigate the negative consequences of stress. The knowledge pertaining to causes of stress can empower individuals and organizations to plan effective stress management interventions.",29

"Reintroducing native wildlife populations is a common conservation-management approach aimed at reducing the threat of extinction and restoring ecosystem function. Captive-born individuals are sometimes used in reintroductions, but the effectiveness of this strategy is poorly understood due to insufficient post-reintroduction monitoring and evaluation. Our objective was to evaluate the utility of using captive-born individuals of an endangered rodent, the Perdido Key beach mouse (Peromyscus polionotus trissyllepsis) to reestablish a population on the western end of Perdido Key at Gulf State Park, Alabama, from which it was extirpated in 1997. We released 48 captive-born mice in March 2010 and monitored the population through livetrapping across 8 sessions spanning 5 years. We evaluated temporal changes in microsatellite genetic diversity to determine whether mice born in the wild were derived from released mice. The number of mice declined by 73% to 13 individuals in the first 2 weeks after release but increased to an estimated 206 (95% confidence interval = 195-217) individuals after 5 years. Genetic monitoring demonstrated a slight decrease in diversity during the first 3 months but an increase by year 5. Admixture from a neighboring population was detected in year 2 and year 5, which corresponded to the largest increase in population size between trapping sessions. This change in abundance corresponded with a doubling of Ne/N signifying a possible role of admixture in population growth and resilience. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using captive-born beach mice to reestablish populations when wild populations are too small to serve as donors for a translocation. We could not, however, discern how gene flow from an expanding neighboring population affected growth or persistence of the reintroduced population. Our study emphasizes that in future reintroductions, genetics should be monitored together with demographic patterns, because cryptic gene flow could affect how we interpret reintroduction success.",34
"The benefit of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) in smoking cessation remains controversial. Recently, e-cigarettes have been gaining popularity in Japan, without evidence of efficacy on quitting cigarettes. We conducted an online survey to collect information on tobacco use, difficulties in smoking cessation, socio-demographic factors, and health-related factors in Japan. Among the total participants (n = 9055), 798 eligible persons aged 20-69 years who smoked within the previous five years were analyzed to assess the relationship between the outcome of smoking cessation and quitting methods used, including e-cigarettes, smoking cessation therapy, and unassisted. E-cigarette use was negatively associated with smoking cessation (odds ratio (OR) = 0.632; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.414-0.964) after adjusting for gender, age, health-related factors, and other quitting methods. Conversely, smoking cessation therapy (i.e., varenicline) was significantly associated with smoking cessation (OR = 1.885; 95% CI = 1.018-3.492) in the same model. For effective smoking cessation, e-cigarette use appears to have low efficacy among smokers in Japan. Allowing for the fact that this study is limited by its cross-sectional design, follow-up studies are needed to assess the prospective association between e-cigarette use and smoking cessation.",26
"The prevalence of antisocial behavior in school settings is still discouraging. Students that often engage in aggressive acts may lack in the ability to appreciate the emotional consequences of their behaviors and share others' emotions. The Children's Empathic Attitudes Questionnaire (CEAQ) is one of the questionnaires used to assess empathy in children and early adolescents. This study is aimed to validate the Spanish version of CEAQ. The sample comprised 297 children (50% males), aged from 7 to 12 years (M = 9.53, SD = 1.2), from Madrid. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated an excellent fit for a unidimensional model, chi(2)(89) = 110.702, p = .059; CFI = .972; RMSEA = .029, 95% CI [.000,.045]. Multigroup invariance analysis showed no significant gender-related differences in all levels. Results also referred an acceptable reliability (omega = .824, r = .610). These results provide psychometric support for the use of the Spanish version of CEAQ as a valid and reliable instrument to assess empathy in children and youth population, especially for school-based interventions.",65
"Soil degradation is one of the most serious ecological problems in the world. In arid and semi-arid northern China, soil degradation predominantly arises from wind erosion. Trends in soil degradation caused by wind erosion in northern China frequently change with human activities and climatic change. To decrease soil loss by wind erosion and enhance local ecosystems, the Chinese government has been encouraging residents to reduce wind-induced soil degradation through a series of national policies and several ecological projects, such as the Natural Forest Protection Program, the National Action Program to Combat Desertification, the ""Three Norths"" Shelter Forest System, the Beijing-Tianjin Sand Source Control Engineering Project, and the Grain for Green Project. All these were implemented a number of decades ago, and have thus created many land management practices and control techniques across different landscapes. These measures include conservation tillage, windbreak networks, checkerboard barriers, the Non-Watering and Tube-Protecting Planting Technique, afforestation, grassland enclosures, etc. As a result, the aeolian degradation of land has been controlled in many regions of arid and semiarid northern China. However, the challenge of mitigating and further reversing soil degradation caused by wind erosion still remains.",55
"Background/Aims: Endoscopic balloon dilation (EBD) can serve as an alternative to surgery for intestinal stenosis associated with Crohn's disease (CD). However, there has been controversy regarding the efficacy and safety of EBD. Here we sought to determine the therapeutic efficacy and safety of EBD for intestinal stenosis in CD. Materials and Methods: Of 43 patients with CD accompanied by intestinal stenosis, 30 underwent EBD. These 30 patients were examined retrospectively in terms of the scope passage rate, surgery-free rate, and whether or not the observation of the distal intestinal tract influenced the therapeutic strategy. Results: The overall scope passage and surgery-free rates were 90.0% and 76.7%, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in the site of the dilated intestinal tract among groups. Patients who had inflammation in the distal intestinal tract alone after EBD accounted for 56.7%. The rate of re-dilation was 46.7%, and time until re-dilation was 6.6 +/- 3.6 months. Conclusion: EBD was associated with favorable short-term and long-term outcomes and good safety. Observation of the distal intestinal tract influenced the decision-making process for therapeutic strategies. The results of this study suggest that EBD may allow the postponement or even avoidance of surgery, enabling not only intestinal dilation but also the evaluation of mucosal healing to be performed. Thus, EBD is considered to be an effective alternative treatment for intestinal stenotic lesions in patients with CD.",118
"Intersections are known for their integral and complex nature due to a variety of the participants' behaviors and interactions. This paper presents a review of recent studies on the behavior at intersections and the safety analysis for three types of participants at intersections: vehicles, drivers, and pedestrians. This paper emphasizes on techniques which are strong candidates for automation with visual sensing technology. A new behavior and safety classification is presented based on key features used for intersection design, planning, and safety. In addition, performance metrics are introduced to evaluate different studies, and insights are provided regarding the state of the art, inputs, algorithms, challenges, and shortcomings.",0
"Renewable energy sources are likely to become essential due to continuously increasing energy demands together with the depletion of natural resources that are currently used for power generation, such as coal and gas. They are also advantageous in terms of their reduced environmental impact. Here, the generation of electrical power from Vortex-Induced Vibration (VIV) of a cylinder is investigated numerically. The cylinder is free to oscillate in the direction transverse to the incoming flow. The cylinder is attached to a magnet that can move along the axis of a coil made from conducting wire. The magnet and the coil together constitute a basic electrical generator. When the cylinder undergoes VIV, the motion of the magnet creates a voltage across the coil, which is connected to a resistive load. By Lenz's law, induced current in the coil applies a retarding force to the magnet. Effectively, the electrical generator applies a damping force on the cylinder with a spatially varying damping coefficient. For the initial investigation reported here, the Reynolds number is restricted to Re <= 200, so that the flow is laminar and two-dimensional (2D). The incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes equations are solved using an extensively validated spectral-element based solver. The effects of the electromagnetic (EM) damping constant xi(m), coil dimensions (radius a, length L), and mass ratio on the electrical power extracted are quantified. It is found that there is an optimal value of xi(m) (xi(opt)) at which maximum electrical power is generated. As the radius or length of the coil is increased, the value of xi(opt) is observed to increase. Although the maximum average power remains the same, a larger coil radius or length results in a more robust system in the sense that a relatively large amount of power can be extracted when xi(m) is far from xi(opt) unlike the constant damping ratio case. The average power output is also a function of Reynolds number, primarily through the increased maximum oscillation amplitude that occurs with increased Reynolds number at least within the laminar range, although the general qualitative findings seem likely to carry across to high Reynolds number VIV.",52
"Based on the findings of postnatal tactile stimulation (TS), a favorable experience in rats, the present study examined the influence of prenatal TS on juvenile behavior, adult amphetamine (AMPH) sensitization, and structural alteration in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the striatum. Female rats received TS through a baby hair brush throughout pregnancy, and the pups born were tested for open field locomotion, elevated plus maze (EPM), novel object recognition (NOR), and play fighting behaviors. Development and persistence of drug-induced behavioral sensitization in adults were tested by repeated AMPH administration and a challenge, respectively. Structural plasticity in the brain was assessed from the prefrontal cortical thickness and striatum size from serial coronal sections. The results indicate that TS females showed enhanced exploration in the open field. TS decreased the frequency of playful attacks whereas the response to face or evade an attack was not affected. Anxiety-like behavior and cognitive performance were not influenced by TS. AMPH administration resulted in gradual increase in locomotor activity (i.e., behavioral sensitization) that persisted at least for 2 weeks. However, both male and female TS rats exhibited attenuated AMPH sensitization compared to sex-matched controls. Furthermore, the drug-associated alteration in the prefrontal cortical thickness and striatum size observed in controls were prevented by TS experience. In summary, TS during prenatal development modified juvenile behavior, attenuated drug-induced behavioral sensitization in adulthood, and reorganized brain regions implicated in drug addiction.

"Background: Ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) induced immune response is a critical issue in transplantation. Complement and contact system activation are among its key mechanisms. Study design: We investigated the benefits of pre-reperfusion treatment with recombinant human C1INH (rhC1INH), inhibitor of both complement and contact activation, in a pig model of kidney autotransplantation, subjecting the organ to 60 min warm ischemia prior to 24 h static preservation to maximize damage. Results: Serum creatinine measurement showed that treated animals recovered glomerular function quicker than the Vehicle group. However, no difference was observed in tubular function recovery, and elevated level of urinary NGal (Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin) and plasma AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) were detected, indicating that treatment did not influence IRI-mediated tubular cell necrosis. Regarding chronic graft outcome, rhC1INH significantly prevented fibrosis development and improved function. Immunohistochemistry and western blot showed decreased invasion by macrophages and T lymphocytes, and reduction of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. We determined the effect of treatment on complement activation with immunofluorescence analyses at 30 min post reperfusion, showing an inhibition of C4d deposition and MBL staining in treated animals. Conclusions: In this model, the inhibition of complement activation by rhC1INH at reperfusion, while not completely counteracting IRI, limited immune system activation, significantly improving graft outcome on the short and long term.",131
"The algorithm for the symbolic computation of the Aluthge transform of a polynomial matrix is derived in this paper. For this purpose, the well-known PSVD by PQRD algorithm is considered to avoid square roots of polynomials in the Aluthge transform matrix. The algorithm for the symbolic computation of the polar decomposition for polynomial matrices is developed as well. Furthermore, the Aluthge transform for rank-one matrices defined by cross-products of vectors is symbolically calculated and presented in a closed formula.",24
"Background & Aims: Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia is characterized by arterio-venous malformations (AVM). It frequently involves the liver without clinical symptoms, but may lead to biliary ischaemia, portal hypertension, or fatal high-output heart failure. The indication of liver transplantation is controversial. Methods: Herein, we report the case of a 65-year-old female patient with a 'double Osler syndrome' consisting of hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and type I hereditary angioedema diagnosed at the age of 25 and 22 years respectively. Results: Hereditary angioedema was treated with danazol for several decades until multiple hypoechogenic liver masses were detected. Albeit danazol treatment was replaced by C1 esterase inhibitor infusions, hepatocellular carcinoma was diagnosed at the age of 64 and the patient was listed for liver transplantation. HHT was marked by recurrent epistaxis until the age of 63 when severe intestinal bleeding occurred. At the age of 65, severe dyspnoea (NYHA class IV) developed and rapidly progressive high-output cardiac failure was diagnosed. Despite argon plasma coagulation to control bleeding from intestinal angiodysplasia, and treatment with bevacizumab to inhibit angiogenesis, the patient died from severe gastrointestinal bleeding associated with cardiogenic shock at the age of 66 before being transplanted. Conclusion: The indication to list this patient for liver transplantation was debated several times before the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma because of good general condition and low MELD score. Precise guidelines for screening and management of patients with hepatic HHT need to be better defined.",131
"The objective of the study was to assess the magnitude and predictors of first-line antiretroviral treatment failure among HIV-infected children. A retrospective cohort study was conducted between January 2006 and December 2015. All pediatric patients of < 15 years old and who took at least 6 months of ART in Fiche and Kuyu hospitals of Oromia region, Ethiopia were included in the study. Collected data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Multi-variable logistic regression was employed to identify predictors of treatment failure. Data of 269 children were analyzed and majority (53.9%) of the children were males with a mean age of 9.8 +/- 3.64 years. Based on the two WHO criteria, overall ART failure was found to be 51 (18.8%), of which 33 (12.26%) had clinical and 18 (6.69%) had immunologic failures. The mean time to the detection of treatment failure was 41 +/- 24.96 months. Children's age between 6 and 9 years (AOR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.72) was protective toward treatment failure, while lost to follow-up (AOR = 7.54, 95% CI: 2.35, 24.16), died (AOR = 22.22, 95% CI: 3.75, 131.54), transferred out (AOR = 3.34, 95% CI: 1.41, 7.87), suboptimal adherence to ART (AOR = 4.85, 95% CI: 1.82, 12.93), baseline CD4 count of < 50 cells/mm(3) (AOR = 4.28, 95% CI: 3.49, 5.9), and WHO advanced clinical stage (AOR = 2.46, 95% CI: 1.14, 5.31) were found to be predictors of treatment failure. The study revealed that the treatment failure is high and the mean time to develop treatment failure is short. The predictors for treatment failure were suboptimal adherence, lost to follow-up, transferred out, initial CD4 count < 50 cells/mm(3), initial WHO stages 3 and 4. On the other hand, being in the age of 6-9 years is protective from developing treatment failure as compared to the other age category.",132
"Composite materials have fine structure,so their development is high cost and complex. Moreover developing the traditional method that is time-consuming, laborious and costly, is difficult to obtain accurate and systematic scientific conclusions. But the application of the finite element analysis software ANSYS can be optimized for composite design, performance analysis, strength of materials bearing damage by computer simulation process, which can obtaina range of experiment information,substantial cost savings and shorten the development cycle. In this paper, the properties of SiC whisker reinforced polymer composites are researched from the whisker aspect ratio, volume ratio and the interfacial bonding status by meaning of finite element software. The results show that: (1)when the aspect ratio, the interface and the volume ratio of whisker increased the load transfer distance increased at the same time andthe whisker could bear more axial stress from the matrix. (2)as the aspect ratio increased, the shearing stress on the interface reduced; however, when the interface and the volume ratio increased,the shearing stress on the interface increased. the impact of interfacial bonding status on the whiskers to bear axial stress is much larger than one of on the resin matrix.",91
"The canonical set of amino acids leads to an exceptionally wide range of protein functionality. Nevertheless, the set of residues still imposes limitations on potential protein applications. The incorporation of noncanonical amino acids can enlarge this scope. There are two complementary approaches for the incorporation of noncanonical amino acids. For site-specific incorporation, in addition to the endogenous canonical translational machineries, an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA-synthetase-tRNA pair must be provided that does not interact with the canonical ones. Consequently, a codon that is not assigned to a canonical amino acid, usually a stop codon, is also required. This genetic code expansion enables the incorporation of a noncanonical amino acid at a single, given site within the protein. The here presented work describes residue-specific incorporation where the genetic code is reassigned within the endogenous translational system. The translation machinery accepts the noncanonical amino acid as a surrogate to incorporate it at canonically prescribed locations, i.e., all occurrences of a canonical amino acid in the protein are replaced by the noncanonical one. The incorporation of noncanonical amino acids can change the protein structure, causing considerably modified physical and chemical properties. Noncanonical amino acid analogs often act as cell growth inhibitors for expression hosts since they modify endogenous proteins, limiting in vivo protein production. In vivo incorporation of toxic noncanonical amino acids into proteins remains particularly challenging. Here, a cell-free approach for a complete replacement of L-arginine by the noncanonical amino acid L-canavanine is presented. It circumvents the inherent difficulties of in vivo expression. Additionally, a protocol to prepare target proteins for mass spectral analysis is included. It is shown that L-lysine can be replaced by L-hydroxy-lysine, albeit with lower efficiency. In principle, any noncanonical amino acid analog can be incorporated using the presented method as long as the endogenous in vitro translation system recognizes it.",30
"Although aesthetic preferences are known to be important in person perception and can play a significant role in everyday social decisions, the effect of the age of the observer on aesthetic preferences for faces of different ages has not yet been fully investigated. In the present study we investigated whether aesthetic preferences change with aging, with an age-related bias in favoring faces from one's own age group. In addition, we examined the role of age on both the perceptual qualities and the social attributes of faces that may influence these aesthetic judgements. Both younger and older adult observers provided ratings to images of younger, middle-aged and older unfamiliar faces. As well as attractiveness, the rating dimensions included other perceptual (distinctiveness, familiarity) and social (competence, trustworthiness and dominance) factors. The results suggested a consistent aesthetic preference for youthful faces across all ages of the observers but, surprisingly, no evidence for an age-related bias in attractiveness ratings. Older adults tended to provide higher ratings of attractiveness, competence and trustworthiness to the unfamiliar faces, consistent with the positivity effect previously reported. We also tested whether perceptual factors such as face familiarity or distinctiveness affected aesthetic ratings. Only ratings of familiarity, but not distinctiveness, were positively associated with the attractiveness of the faces. Moreover, ratings of familiarity decreased with increasing age of the face. With regard to the social characteristics of the faces, we found that the age of the face negatively correlated with ratings of trustworthiness provided by all observers, but with the competence ratings of older observers only. Interestingly, older adults provided higher ratings of perceived competence and trustworthiness to younger than older faces. However, our results also suggest that higher attractiveness ratings, together with older aged faces, led to more positive evaluations of competence. The results are discussed within the context of an age-related decline in the differentiation of faces in memory. Our findings have important implications for a better understanding of age-related perceptual factors and cognitive determinants of social interactions with unfamiliar others across the adult lifespan.",63
"Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is one of the most popular public key cryptosystems in recent years due to its higher security strength and lower resource consumption. However, the noninvasive side-channel attacks (SCAs) have been proved to be a big threat to ECC systems in many previous researches. In this paper, we propose a low-area-time-product ECC coprocessor for GF(2(m)) with the ability to resist most of the existing noninvasive SCAs. The basic countermeasures are relied on the underlying finite field arithmetics in randomized Montgomery domain, which can blind the intermediate value in the iterations of scalar multiplication to prevent the adversaries from cracking the private key by statistical methods. Meanwhile, we optimize the modular division and modular multiplication algorithms to fix the operating time to resist some certain timing attacks, and the Montgomery Ladder algorithm makes the coprocessor immune against simple SCAs. To efficiently implement our coprocessor, we present a hybrid operation sequence which merely needs one multiplication module and one division module to complete the entire operations. The synthesis results indicate that our design is superior to other related works in area-time product (ATP) and the extra overhead paid for the countermeasures is less than 5%.",57
"Iodine is an essential trace element for the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Excessive, as well as deficient, iodine ingestion adversely affects thyroid function. The major sources of iodine in Japan are edible seaweeds, namely Nori, Wakame and Kombu. The iodine content of Kombu ranges from 1.5 to 5.3 mg/g. Although Japan has been regarded as a non-goitrous or iodine excess country, cases of endemic goiter in the northern island of Hokkaido could be tracked back to 1899. However, few recent data on the relationship between iodine status and thyroid dysfunction is available because there is no surveillance system to monitor iodine intake. A nationwide school-based survey throughout Japan has been conducted from 2013. As of February 2017 the survey had covered 16,193 children from 52 schools across 21 of 47 prefectures. Overall, the median urinary iodine concentration for all the sites combined was 265 mu g/L suggesting iodine sufficiency not excess.",133
"ObjectiveA large body of factor analytic research supports the idea that common mental disorders are organized along correlated latent dimensions termed internalizing and externalizing. Eating disorders (EDs) have been associated with both internalizing (mood and anxiety disorders) and externalizing (substance use, antisocial personality disorder) forms of psychopathology. Previous studies found that EDs are most strongly related to internalizing disorders. However, no previous factor analytic studies of EDs and the internalizing/externalizing dimensions have evaluated if EDs align with these spectra similarly for men and women. We examined the location of anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge eating disorder (BED) symptoms within this model of psychopathology among a sample of veterans, a population traditionally understudied in EDs. MethodData were from two studies of veterans and their intimate partners (N=453 men and 307 women). Participants were administered the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV without skip-outs. Lifetime symptom severity scores were used in confirmatory factor analytic models. ResultsA model with AN, BN, and BED symptoms loading onto the distress subfactor of the internalizing domain fit the data best in the full sample and the male and female subsamples. This model was statistically equivalent for men and women. DiscussionAll three EDs loaded onto distress, indicating that these conditions overlap with psychopathology characterized by negative affect. Investigating latent dimensions of psychopathology is one approach to identifying common factors that partially account for patterns of comorbidity among psychiatric disorders, which may aid in translating research findings into clinical practice.

"Medicine Agency and the Food and Drug Administration. Concerning inhalant allergens, the safety of SLIT is overall superior to that of subcutaneous immunotherapy in terms of systemic adverse events. No fatality has been ever reported, and episodes of anaphylaxis were described only exceptionally. Looking at the historical and recent trials, most (>90%) adverse events are ""local"" and confined to the site of administration. For this reason, a specific grading system has been developed by the World Allergy Organization to classify and describe local adverse events. There is an increasing amount of literature concerning oral desensitization for food allergens, referred to as oral immunotherapy. Also, in this case, local side effects are predominant, although systemic adverse events are more frequent than with inhalant allergens. We review herein the description of local side effects due to SLIT, with a special focus on large trials having a declared sample size calculation. The use of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities nomenclature for adverse events is mentioned in this context, as recommended by regulatory agencies. It is expected that a uniform classification/grading of local adverse events will improve and harmonize the surveillance and reporting on the safety of SLIT.

"There are debates about whether rainwater is suitable as drinking water. A serious shortcoming of the debate is that there are differences in the design and management of rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems. This study is based on the performance of two RWH systems that are used for drinking purposes at a kindergarten and a primary school in Cu Khe, Vietnam. Each system comprised a painted galvanized iron roof, a first-flush diverter, two stainless steel tanks connected in series, a calmed inlet, mosquito screens on open holes, PVC pipelines, filter cartridges, and a UV sterilizer. During 18 months, stored rainwater was sampled five times, and treated rainwater was sampled four times. Twenty-three water quality parameters were analyzed, including pH, total dissolved solids, turbidity, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, hardness, arsenic, iron, cadmium, nickel, chromium, manganese, mercury, selenium, lead, zinc, Escherichia coli, and total coliform. It was found that all the physicochemical qualities of the stored rainwater, prior to treatment, satisfied the World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water guidelines. After physical filtration and UV sterilization, all parameters, including microbiological indicators, satisfied the WHO drinking water guidelines. Further management strategies to stabilize water quality were discussed.",95
"Building on a martingale approach to global optimization, a powerful stochastic search scheme for the global optimum of cost functions is proposed using change of measures on the states that evolve as diffusion processes and splitting of the state-space along the lines of a Bayesian game. To begin with, the efficacy of the optimizer, when contrasted with one of the most efficient existing schemes, is assessed against a family of No-hard benchmark problems. Then, using both simulated and experimental data, potentialities of the new proposal are further explored in the context of an inverse problem of significance in photoacoustic imaging, wherein the superior""reconstruction features of a global search vis-a-vis the commonly adopted local or quasi-local schemes are brought into relief.

"Drogue detection is a fundamental issue during the close docking phase of autonomous aerial refueling (AAR). To cope with this issue, a novel and effective method based on deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is proposed. In order to ensure its robustness and wide application, a deep learning dataset of images was prepared by utilizing real data of ""Probe and Drogue"" aerial refueling, which contains diverse drogues in various environmental conditions without artificial features placed on the drogues. By employing deep learning ideas and graphics processing units (GPUs), a model for drogue detection using a Caffe deep learning framework with CNNs was designed to ensure the method's accuracy and real-time performance. Experiments were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and results based on real AAR data compare its performance to other methods, validating the accuracy, speed, and robustness of its drogue detection ability.

"Background: Several lines of evidence suggest that the dietary isoflavone genistein (Gen) has beneficial effects with regard to cardiovascular disease and in particular on aspects related to blood pressure and angiogenesis. The biological action of Gen may be, at Least in part, attributed to its ability to affect cell signalling and response. However, so far, most of the molecular mechanisms underlying the activity of Gen in the endothelium are unknown. Methods and results: To examine the transcriptional response to 2.5 mu M Gen on primary human endothelial cells (HUVEC), we applied cDNA array technology both under baseline condition and after treatment with the pro-atherogenic stimulus, copper-oxidized LDL. The alteration of the expression patterns of individual transcripts was substantiated using either RT-PCR or Northern blotting. Gen significantly affected the expression of genes encoding for proteins centrally involved in the vascular tone such as endothelin-converting enzyme-1, endothetin-2, estrogen related receptor a and atria[ natriuretic peptide receptor A precursor. Furthermore, Gen countered the effect of oxLDL on mRNA levels encoding for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 165, types 1 and 2. Conclusions: Our data indicate that physiologically achievable levels of Gen change the expression of mRNA encoding for proteins involved in the control of blood pressure under baseline conditions and reduce the angiogenic response to oxLDL in the endothelium.

"Purpose: The purpose of the study was to describe women's experiences of undergoing total knee joint replacement surgery. Design: A qualitative approach was used. Method: A content analysis of the text from interviews with five women was conducted. Findings: The time before surgery was marked by the experience of constant pain, which affected the women negatively in their everyday lives. During surgery, the information provided by the staff gave each woman a sense of security; the women handed over responsibility to the staff and experienced a sensation of relief. The postoperative period was characterized by a feeling of joy when the surgery was over, although a rough and tedious rehabilitation phase then began. Challenges in everyday life were a factor for motivation and confidence, although postoperative pain was experienced as discouraging. Conclusion: Support from health care staff is an important factor for coping with everyday life during the preoperative, perioperative and postoperative phases of undergoing knee joint replacement.",15
"Online consultation is increasingly offered by parenting practitioners, but it is not clear if it is feasible to provide empowerment-oriented support in a single session email consultation. Based on the empowerment theory, we developed the Guiding the Empowerment Process model (GEP model) to evaluate text-based consultation. By content analysis of the email advice (n = 129; 5997 sentences in total), we investigated the feasibility of the newly developed model (inter-observer agreement, internal consistency and factor structure) and its validity. Concurrent validity was evaluated by comparing coding results using the GEP model and a Social Support model that partially intersects with empowerment. Results showed good inter-observer reliability and internal consistency of the GEP model. The results provided evidence for its concurrent validity by a significant correlation of the coding results from the GEP model with the Social Support model, although it was also distinctive. All described techniques which practitioners may employ to guide the parental process towards empowerment were observed in the sample. Also, guidance was provided in all components of the empowerment process. Feasibility of the GEP model for content analysis of email consultation in parental support from a theoretical empowerment perspective has been demonstrated.",18
"Protein secondary structure prediction is an important problem in bioinformatics and transforming biomedical big data into valuable knowledge is also a quite interesting and challenging task. Various machine learning algorithms have been widely applied in bioinformatics to extract knowledge from protein data. In recent years, multilayer perceptron, emerging on the basis of artificial neural networks, is making major advances in many domains. In this paper, we have focused on analysing the machine learning based Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) algorithms in protein secondary structure prediction using different set of input features and network parameters in distributed computing environment. Overall, the MLP analysis results in classifying protein secondary structures are encouraging, the accuracy and performance are overwhelming by passing various input features and it outperforms when it will be implemented in various distributed environment. The experimental result shows that the multilayer perceptron machine learning algorithm models outperforms the other machine learning approaches.",2
"To investigate the patient-reported multidimensional gastrointestinal symptoms predictors of generic health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in pediatric patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (TM) (PedsQL (TM)) Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales and PedsQL (TM) 4.0 Generic Core Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 259 pediatric patients with functional constipation, functional abdominal pain (FAP), or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales measuring stomach pain, stomach discomfort when eating, food and drink limits, trouble swallowing, heartburn and reflux, nausea and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood in poop, and diarrhea were identified as clinically important symptom differentiators from healthy controls based on prior findings, and subsequently tested for bivariate and multivariate linear associations with overall HRQOL. Gastrointestinal symptoms were differentially associated with decreased HRQOL in bivariate analyses for the three FGIDs. In predictive models utilizing hierarchical multiple regression analyses controlling for age, gender, and race/ethnicity, gastrointestinal symptoms differentially accounted for an additional 47, 40, and 60 % of the variance in patient-reported HRQOL for functional constipation, FAP, and IBS, respectively, reflecting large effect sizes. Significant individual gastrointestinal symptoms predictors were identified after controlling for the other gastrointestinal symptoms in the FGID-specific predictive models. Gastrointestinal symptoms represent potentially modifiable predictors of generic HRQOL in pediatric patients with FGIDs. Identifying the condition-specific gastrointestinal symptoms that are the most important predictors from the patient perspective facilitates a patient-centered approach to targeted interventions designed to ameliorate impaired overall HRQOL.",4
"In this work, we demonstrated the successful construction of metal-free zero-dimensional/two-dimensional carbon nanodot (CND)-hybridized protonated g-C3N4 (pCN) (CND/pCN) heterojunction photocatalysts by means of electrostatic attraction. We experimentally found that CNDs with an average diameter of 4.4 nm were uniformly distributed on the surface of pCN using electron microscopy analysis. The CND/pCN-3 sample with a CND content of 3 wt.% showed the highest catalytic activity in the CO2 photoreduction process under visible and simulated solar light. This process results in the evolution of CH4 and CO. The total amounts of CH4 and CO generated by the CND/pCN-3 photocatalyst after 10 h of visible-light activity were found to be 29.23 and 58.82 mu mol . g(catalyst)(-1), respectively. These values were 3.6 and 2.28 times higher, respectively, than the amounts generated when using pCN alone. The corresponding apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) was calculated to be 0.076%. Furthermore, the CND/pCN-3 sample demonstrated high stability and durability after four consecutive photoreaction cycles, with no significant decrease in the catalytic activity. The significant improvement in the photoactivity using CND/pCN-3 was attributed to the synergistic interaction between pCN and CNDs. This synergy allows the effective migration of photoexcited electrons from pCN to CNDs via well-contacted heterojunction interfaces, which retards the charge recombination. This was confirmed by photoelectrochemical measurements, and steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence analyses. The first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were consistent with our experimental results, and showed that the work function of CNDs (5.56 eV) was larger than that of pCN (4.66 eV). This suggests that the efficient shuttling of electrons from the conduction band of pCN to CNDs hampers the recombination of electron-hole pairs. This significantly increased the probability of free charge carriers reducing CO2 to CH4 and CO. Overall, this study underlines the importance of understanding the charge carrier dynamics of the CND/pCN hybrid nanocomposites, in order to enhance solar energy conversion.",100

"Background: To facilitate priority-setting in health policymaking, we compiled the best available information to estimate the adult mortality (>30 years) burden attributable to 13 metabolic, lifestyle, infectious, and environmental risk factors in Taiwan. Methods: We obtained data on risk factor exposure from nationally representative health surveys, cause-specific mortality from the National Death Registry, and relative risks from epidemiological studies and meta-analyses. We applied the comparative risk assessment framework to estimate mortality burden attributable to individual risk factors or risk factor clusters. Results: In 2009, high blood glucose accounted for 14,900 deaths (95% UI: 11,850-17,960), or 10.4% of all deaths in that year. It was followed by tobacco smoking (13,340 deaths, 95% UI: 10,330-16,450), high blood pressure (11,190 deaths, 95% UI: 8,190-14,190), ambient particulate matter pollution (8,600 deaths, 95% UI: 7,370-9,840), and dietary risks (high sodium intake and low intake of fruits and vegetables, 7,890 deaths, 95% UI: 5,970-9,810). Overweight-obesity and physical inactivity accounted for 7,620 deaths (95% UI: 6,040-9,190), and 7,400 deaths (95% UI: 6,670-8,130), respectively. The cardiometabolic risk factors of high blood pressure, high blood glucose, high cholesterol, and overweight-obesity jointly accounted for 12,120 deaths (95% UI: 11,220-13,020) from cardiovascular diseases. For domestic risk factors, infections from hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) were responsible for 6,300 deaths (95% UI: 5,610-6,980) and 3,170 deaths (95% UI: 1,860-4,490), respectively, and betel nut use was associated with 1,780 deaths from oral, laryngeal, and esophageal cancer (95% UI: 1,190-2,360). The leading risk factors for years of life lost were similar, but the impact of tobacco smoking and alcohol use became larger because the attributable deaths from these risk factors occurred among young adults aged less than 60 years. Conclusions: High blood glucose, tobacco smoking, and high blood pressure are the major risk factors for deaths from diseases and injuries among Taiwanese adults. A large number of years of life would be gained if the 13 modifiable risk factors could be removed or reduced to the optimal level.",129
"Background. We describe the recruitment of men for The Testosterone (T) Trials, which were designed to determine the efficacy of T treatment. Methods. Men were eligible if they were >= 65 years, had an average of two morning total T values300 ng/mL, and had symptoms and objective evidence of mobility limitation, sexual dysfunction, and/or low vitality. Men had to be eligible for and enroll in at least one of these three main trials (physical function, sexual function, vitality). Results. Men were recruited primarily through mass mailings in 12 U.S. communities: 82% of men who contacted the sites did so in response to mailings. Men who responded were screened by telephone to ascertain eligibility. Of 51,085 telephone screens, 53.5% were eligible for further screening. Of 23,889 initial screening visits (SV1), 2,781 (11.6%) men were eligible for the second screening visit (SV2), which 2,261 (81.3%) completed. At SV2, 931 (41.2%) men met the criteria for one or more trials, the T level criterion and had no other exclusions. Of these, 790 (84.6%) were randomized; 99 (12.5%) in all three trials and 348 (44%) in two trials. Their mean age was 72 years and mean body mass index (BMI) was 31.0 kg/m(2). Mean (standard deviation) total T (ng/dL) was 212.0 (40.0). Conclusion: Despite the telephone screening to enrollment ratio of 65 to 1, we met the recruitment goals for each trial. Recruitment of symptomatic older men with low testosterone levels is difficult but feasible.",6
"How do young children negotiate conflicts with peers that result in mutually beneficial resolution and peaceful interaction after conflict? A few studies suggest that when children use conciliatory strategies in conflict, socially adaptive outcomes are more likely to be achieved. The present study explores the relative associations of types of children's conciliatory conflict resolution strategies (i.e., prosocial, compliance-oriented, solution-oriented, and verbal clarification/apology) with conflict outcomes to contribute to knowledge of the discrete behaviors that might have salience for conflict resolution training. Socially adaptive conflict outcomes were expected to strongly relate to children's resolution strategies of a prosocial nature as well as to teacher or peer interventions encouraging prosocial behavior or empathy. Sampled conflicts (N=521) were collected through field observations of 107 ethnically/racially and socioeconomically diverse four-to seven-year-old children. Logistic regression analyses with bootstrap-based inference suggested that children's prosocial behaviors in conflict were most strongly tied to mutually beneficial resolution and peaceful postconflict interaction, when controlling for relevant covariates. Other conciliatory strategies varied in their association with socially adaptive outcomes. The hypothesis regarding third-party interventions encouraging prosociability or empathy could not be examined due to infrequent occurrence. Insights for future research on children's socially adaptive conflict negotiations are discussed.",65
"Women are still underrepresented in management and men hold the majority of higher positions. Nonetheless, one often-heard claim in popular media is that female people-centered leadership skills (empathy, communication, etc.) are a better match for the business world - especially in the future. Furthermore, a related idea is that women may use this advantage to take over men's dominant position in leadership. Four studies show that such claims paradoxically maintain gender inequality, by undermining support for affirmative action to reduce female underrepresentation in leadership. Where earlier research shows that positive stereotypes can hurt women by suggesting that they are unqualified for leadership, the current findings show that even positive stereotypes that claim that women are particularly well qualified for leadership can hurt women in their chances for gaining leadership positions. Although it is good to highlight the advantages of female leadership, exaggerated and sensationalist claims contribute to a perpetuation of gender inequality.",61

"The fundamental purpose of sleep remains one of the most compelling questions yet to be answered in the area of neuroscience, if not all of biology. A pervasive behavior among members of the animal kingdom, the functional necessity of engaging regularly in sleep is best demonstrated by showing that failing to do so leads to a broad repertoire of pathological outcomes including cognitive, immunological, hormonal, and metabolic outcomes, among others. Indeed, an absolute requirement for sleep has been shown in studies that have demonstrated that continuous total deprivation of sleep for as short a period as 15 days is generally lethal in some species. The most common clinical sleep disorder, insomnia, is both a principal disease ( primary insomnia) as well as a co-morbidity of a large number of other ostensibly unrelated diseases including chronic pain, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and depression. From a treatment perspective, restoring normal healthy sleep delivers subsequent benefits in waking cognitive function and mood with the potential for beneficial therapeutic impact on daily functioning across multiple diseases for which restorative healthy sleep is compromised. Our remarkable escalation in understanding the anatomy and physiology of sleep/wake control mechanisms provides new opportunities to modify the neurobiology of sleep and wake-related behaviors in novel and exciting ways. In parallel, expansion of sleep research into novel interfaces between sleep-wake biology and disease states is revealing additional extensive implications of lost sleep. Current investigational and conventional pharmacological approaches for the treatment of sleep and wake disorders are discussed based on their mechanism of action within the CNS and their effect on sleep and wake. This review of recent sleep biology and sleep pharmacology peers into the future of sleep therapeutics to highlight both mechanistic safety and functional outcomes as key for differentiating and establishing success for the next generation of arousal modifying therapeutics.",128
"Point vortex models are frequently encountered in conceptual studies in geophysical fluid dynamics, but also in practical applications, for instance, in aeronautics. In spherical geometry, the motion of vortex centres is governed by a dynamical system with a known Poisson structure. We construct Poisson integration methods for these dynamics by splitting the Hamiltonian into its constituent vortex pair terms. From backward error analysis, the method is formally known to provide solutions to a modified Poisson system with the correct bracket, but with a modified Hamiltonian function. Different orderings of the pair wise interactions are considered and also used for the construction of higher order methods. The energy and momentum conservation of the splitting schemes is demonstrated for several test cases. For particular orderings of the pairwise interactions, the schemes allow scalable parallelization. This results in a linear as opposed to quadratic scaling of computation time with system size when scaling the number of processors accordingly. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",101
"Background: With the marked increase in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus, it was the purpose of our study to assess a potential association of time-cumulated exposure to systolic (CumSBP) and of diastolic blood pressure (CumDBP) with onset of impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes mellitus. Methods: The prospective investigation included participants of the longitudinal Kailuan Study with three baseline examinations in 2006-2007, 2008-2009 and 2010-2011, re-examination in 2012-2013, and no diabetes mellitus at baseline. Cumulative blood pressure (BP) was calculated as cumBP = [(BP1 + BP2)/2 x time(1-2)] + [(BP2 + BP3)/2 x time(2-3)]. Based on cumSBP, the study population was stratified into four groups (cumSBP < 480mmHgxyear;n = 15,339; 480mmHgxyear <= cumSBP < 520mmHgxyear;n = 7214; 520mmHgxyears <= cumSBP= 560mmHgxyears; n = 10,576). Results: After adjusting for demographic, anthropomorphic, biochemical, socioeconomic and lifestyle parameters and as compared with the first group, the second, third and fourth group showed a significantly higher incidence of diabetes (P-trend < 0.001; hazard ratio (HR);95% confidence interval (CI):1.28(1.08,1.51),1.54(1.29,1.84), and 2.33(1.98,2.73), respectively), higher incidence of impairment of glucose tolerance (P-trend < 0.001; HR; 95% CI1.17(1.02,1.33), 1.43(1.25,1.64), and 2.09(1.85,2.37), respectively), and higher incidence of diabetes developing out of an impairment of glucose tolerance (P-trend < 0.001; HR; 95% CI:1.22(0.97,1.54), 1.47(1.16,1.86), and 2.01(1.62,2.50), respectively). An increase in cumSBP by 10 mmHg/year or an increase in cumDBP by 5 mmHg/year was associated with a hazard ratio of incident diabetes of 1.04 (95% CI:1.03,1.04) and 1.02(1.02,1.03), respectively, with a hazard ratio of incident impairment of glucose tolerance of 1.04(95% CI:1.03,1.04) and 1.03(95% CI: 1.02,1.03), respectively, and with a hazard ratio of incident diabetes developing from impairment of glucose tolerance of 1.04(95% CI:1.03,1.04) and 1.03(95% CI:1.02,1.03), respectively. Conclusions: Time-cumulated exposure to elevated blood pressure was significantly associated with an elevated incidence of impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes.",120
"The diversity of reactions catalyzed by enzymes reliant on pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) demonstrates the catalytic versatility of this cofactor and the plasticity of the protein scaffolds of the major fold types of PLP-dependent enzymes. The enzymes of the transsulfuration (cystathionine gamma-synthase and cystathionine beta-lyase) and reverse transsulfuration (cystathionine beta-synthase and cystathionine gamma-Iyase) pathways interconvert L-cysteine and L-homocysteine, the immediate precursor of L-methionine, in plants/bacteria and yeast/animals, respectively. These enzymes provide a useful model system for investigation of the mechanisms of substrate and reaction specificity in PLP-dependent enzymes as they catalyze distinct side chain rearrangements of similar amino acid substrates. Exploration of the underlying factors that enable enzymes to control the substrate and reaction specificity of this cofactor will enable the engineering of these properties and the development of therapeutics and antimicrobial compounds. Recent studies probing the role of active-site residues, of the enzymes of the transsulfuration pathways, as determinants of substrate and reaction specificity are the subject of this review.

"Tobacco consumption has become a major public health issue, which has motivated studies to identify and understand the biological processes involved in the smoking behavior for prevention and smoking cessation treatments. CYP2A6 has been identified as the main gene that codifies the enzyme that metabolizes nicotine. Many alleles have been identified after the discovery of CYP2A6, suggesting a wide interethnic variability and a diverse smoking behavior of the allele carrying individuals. The main purpose of this review is to update and highlight the effects of the CYP2A6 gene variability related to tobacco consumption reported from diverse human populations. The review further aims to consider CYP2A6 in future studies as a possible genetic marker for the prevention and treatment of nicotine addiction. Therefore, we analyzed several population studies and their importance at addressing and characterizing a population using specific parameters. Our efforts may contribute to a personalized system for detecting, preventing and treating populations at a higher risk of smoking to avoid diseases related to tobacco consumption.",26
"Purpose:Nonmedical out-of-pocket cost to both patients and their companions of office visits for routine glaucoma care has not been extensively studied in the United States. We evaluate potential key predictors of patient expenditures that are critical to assessing the cost-effectiveness of glaucoma health care delivery.Materials and Methods:In total, 300 patients responded to the survey in 3 clinics in 2 clinical practice settings. Main outcome measures included both average visit and yearly expenditures.Results:Of the 300 patients, the majority were female (n=187, 62.3%) and African American (n=171, 57.0%). The median age was 66 years. The median [range; mean (SD)] expenditure per patient visit was $22.10 ($11.1, $42.9; $44.1 (72.8)). Patients with companions paid $38.77 more in average visit expenditure (: 0.87, P<0.001). The average visit expenditure for retired patients was $17.37 less when compared with nonretired patients (: -0.4, P=0.004). Patients living in a rural or suburban area paid $43.91 and $14.13 more per visit, respectively (: 0.73, P=0.0004; : 0.31, P=0.03), compared with patients living in an urban area. Patients with noncommercial insurance paid $24.01 less in average visit expenditure (: -0.66, P=0.0008). The median yearly patient expenditure was $96.70 [$44.6, $222.7; $210.4 (333.9)]. Patients with companions paid $192.37 more in yearly expenditure (: 0.9, P<0.001) than those without companions, whereas retired patients paid $80.83 less in yearly expenditure (: -0.39, P=0.03) than nonretirees. Patients with noncommercial insurance paid $109.34 less in yearly expenditure (: -0.63, P=0.01).Conclusions:Although a small part of the total cost of glaucoma care, nonmedical out-of-pocket costs constitute a substantial noncovered medical expense to most patients in the United States. Patients who are employed, come with companions, live in nonurban areas, or are on Medicare have greater expenditures.",8
"The transcription factor GATA1 regulates the expression of essential erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation genes through binding to the DNA consensus sequence WGATAR. The GATA1 protein has four functional domains, including two centrally located zinc-finger domains and two transactivation domains at the N- and C-termini. These functional domains play characteristic roles in the elaborate regulation of diversified GATA1 target genes, each of which exhibits a unique expression profile. Three types of GATA1-related hematological malignancies have been reported. One is a structural mutation in the GATA1 gene, resulting in the production of a short form of GATA1 that lacks the N-terminal transactivation domain and is found in Down syndrome-related acute megakaryocytic leukemia. The other two are cis-acting regulatory mutations affecting expression of the Gata1 gene, which have been shown to cause acute erythroblastic leukemia and myelofibrosis in mice. Therefore, imbalanced gene regulation caused by qualitative and quantitative changes in GATA1 is thought to be involved in specific hematological disease pathogenesis. In the present review, we discuss recent advances in understanding the mechanisms of differential transcriptional regulation by GATA1 during erythroid differentiation, with special reference to the binding kinetics of GATA1 at conformation-specific binding sites.",12
"Maternal mammalian toxicity impacts prenatal development, with general systemic maternal toxicity, from reduced weight gain to morbidity, causative for reduced fetal weights/litter and increased fetal variations (especially skeletal)/litter, but not, in the author's opinion, for increased fetal malformations, reduced litter sizes or full litter losses. Increased fetal malformations are likely due to exposure to specific chemicals which alter specific maternal functions at critical point(s) in pregnancy, typically exaggerated effects from higher doses by drugs under development with known, desired pharmacological effects. Malformations can also be from genetic/epigenetic alterations, specific altered proteins, molecular pathways, etc. Full litter losses are triggered by the mother and are rare in rats. Information to inform maternal (and developmental) toxicity includes ovarian corpora lutea counts, uterine implantation profile, degree of litter reduction (if present), timing and extent of maternal toxicity relative to those of adverse embryofetal effects, etc. The view of maternal toxicity as confounding results in in vivo developmental toxicity studies, worldwide concerns about increased research animal usage, increasing time, labor, costs, and new software and hardware sophistication all drive the interest in development, validation, and performance of in vitro/in silico assays. These assays are fast, inexpensive, responsive to animal use concerns and amenable to mechanistic questions. The strength of these in vitro/in silico assays is considered by many to be the absence of the maternal organism/placenta. These assays inform mechanism and hazard, but NOT risk. The Environmental Protection Agency currently estimates that these new assays are approximately 70% accurate versus the whole animal tests. Birth Defects Res (Part B) 95:195-201, 2012.

"In recent years, the survivability of an aircraft has been put to task more than ever before. One of the main reasons is the increase in the usage of Infrared (IR) guided Anti-Aircraft Missiles, especially due to the availability of Man Portable Air Defence System (MANPADS) with some terrorist groups. Thus, aircraft IR signatures are gaining more importance as compared to their radar, visual, acoustic, or any other signatures. The exhaust plume ejected from the aircraft is one of the important sources of IR signature in military aircraft that use low bypass turbofan engines for propulsion. The focus of the present work is modelling of spectral IR radiation emission from the exhaust jet of a typical military aircraft and to evaluate the aircraft susceptibility in terms of the aircraft lock-on range due to its plume emission, for a simple case against a typical Surface to Air Missile (SAM). The IR signature due to the aircraft plume is examined in a holistic manner. A comprehensive methodology of computing IR signatures and its affect on aircraft lock-on range is elaborated. Commercial CFD software has been used to predict the plume thermo-physical properties and subsequently an in-house developed code was used for evaluating the IR radiation emitted by the plume. The LOWTRAN code has been used for modeling the atmospheric IR characteristics. The results obtained from these models are in reasonable agreement with some available experimental data. The analysis carried out in this paper succinctly brings out the intricacy of the radiation emitted by various gaseous species in the plume and the role of atmospheric IR transmissivity in dictating the plume IR signature as perceived by an IR guided SAM.",98
"While horizontal partitioning of traditional relational databases is well studied, there is in comparison very little in the literature about the partitioning of NoSQL databases, especially those that are cloud based, such as Amazon's SimpleDB. In order to optimize the response time of a web application using a cloud based database, it is possible to partition the database for storage on local regional servers. In this work, data mining and cluster analysis of database logs is used in order to partition, thus essentially caching, data on local servers. This work compares the average response times of three partitioning algorithms on a simple web application using a cloud based NoSQL database management system. The experimental study shows that the techniques presented can improve web application performance.",112
"This paper explores the performance of a DC-DC converter based with current mode controller photovoltaic (PV) simulator which emulates the output characteristics of a real PV module. A portable PV simulator prototype of 85 W is examined in terms of its steady state IV curve matching capacity and the convergence time corresponding to step change in current source load, voltage source load, and insolation levels. The current voltage (IV) characteristics of the PV module are implemented as a look-up-table (LUT) which determines the reference output current from measured output voltage. A Thevenin Equivalent Method approach to PV arrays analysis is also included in order to model the small-signal linearized characteristics. Extensive simulation results obtained in MAT LAB are included to show that the PV simulator can work in most situations as a real PV module. Preliminary experimental results verify performance with current-source and voltage-source loads",48
"Structural temperature is an important form of loading for bridges, particularly for long-span steel structures. In this study, the temperature distribution of the Humber Bridge in the United Kingdom is investigated using numerical simulation and field measurements. A two-dimensional fine finite-element model of a typical section of the box girder of this long-span suspension bridge is constructed. The time-dependent thermal boundary conditions are determined using field meteorological measurements with external surface heat-convection coefficients varying according to differing local wind speeds they experience. Preanalysis is adopted to determine the initial thermal condition of the model, then transient heat-transfer analysis is performed and the time-dependent temperature distribution of the bridge is obtained, leading to numerical temperature data at different locations in different times that are in good agreement with the measured counterparts. The vertical and transversal temperature differences (TTDs) of the box girder are also investigated. Both measured and numerical results show that the transversal temperature variation across the streamlined girder is significant. The effects of the box-girder shape, pavement of the upper webs, and bridge orientation on the TTD are finally investigated. (c) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.",97

"The development and manufacturing of gear pairs is determined by a system combining the kinematic basis of the relative motions between workpiece and tool with the necessary production technology. This system unites the two subsystems of theory and technology. Via a multitude of parameters, gears can be assigned to different classes according to the range of existence. The paper describes a mathematical model for determining the range of existence for the general kinematic scheme of gear shaping. This model is based on an analysis of the existing kinematic schemes of theoretical and real shaping. Based on a morphological approach, individual kinematic shaping schemes are classified, and their mathematical models are developed. The shaping schemes, as well as the necessary translational and rotational motion matrices, are exemplarily presented for a gear manufacturing machine using the shaping principle. The modern approaches to the principles of designing equipment and instrumentation systems for gear manufacturing are presented. Methodical basics for selecting the optimal machine configuration depending on the technical and economic requirements for the machining and form of a gear's tooth profile are stated. The system for theoretical and technological optimization synthesis of instrumentation systems for gear manufacturing is presented.",85
"Purpose: The authors aimed to analyze the causes and outcomes of golf-related ocular injuries in this retrospective meta-analysis, literature review, and original case series. Methods: Forty-one articles identified by PubMed search resulted in 11 included studies yielding 102 subjects. Included articles described all ocular golf injuries that presented to an institution during a determined period. Eight factors were analyzed: age, sex, location and mechanism of injury, protective eyewear use, resulting open-globe injury, resulting enucleation, and visual acuity changes. Results: No subjects wore adequate protective eyewear. Significantly more subjects were injured by golf balls (72%) than golf clubs (27%) or foreign body (1%) (P < 0.0001). The ratio of golf ball to club injuries was significantly higher in adults (92%) than in children (23%) (P < 0.0001). Forty-seven of 93 (51%) injuries resulted in an open globe, whereas 27/ 82 (33%) injuries resulted in enucleation. The mean +/- SD logMAR visual acuity improved by 20.641 +/- 0.745 after treatment (. 6 lines of improvement; P = 0.0001). Conclusion: Reported ocular golf injuries occur less frequently than other ocular sports injuries, but may result in devastating outcomes. Supervision of children using golf equipment should be encouraged.",27
"Background: Understanding risk factors that may vary culturally can help improve preventive strategies for obesity. This is the first cross-sectional study aimed to determine the risk factors for overweight/obesity in children aged 2-6 years in a central Anatolian city in Turkey. Methods: A total of 1582 children (1351 healthy, 231 overweight/ obese) aged 2-6 years were included from the Anthropometry of Turkish Children aged 0-6 years database. Age, gender, birth weight, birth order, mother's age, mother's body mass index (BMI), weight gain of mothers during pregnancy, presence of gestational diabetes, breastfeeding duration, history of formula feeding, mother's and father's education, mother's job, monthly income, smoking at home and physical activity, sleep duration and duration of television (TV) watching of the children were evaluated as independent risk factors. Logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate risk factors for overweight/obesity. Results: Having a high family income compared to bad [odds ratio (OR) = 1.96; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.237-3.106], increased the time of watching TV during the weekend (OR = 1.094; 95% CI: 1.032-1.159), and similar physical activity level according to their peers compared to less (OR = 2.957; 95% CI: 1.056-8.282) were found to be significantly associated with a higher risk of overweight/ obesity in children aged 2-6 years old. Conclusions: The early childhood period seems to be important in the establishment of healthy behavioral patterns, especially limitation of TV watching and encouragement of physical activity. Obesogenic environment in families with high incomes need to be revealed.",120
This paper presents the design and experimental validation of a new model-free data-driven iterative reference input tuning (IRIT) algorithm that solves a reference trajectory tracking problem as an optimization problem with control signal saturation constraints and control signal rate constraints. The IRIT algorithm design employs an experiment-based stochastic search algorithm to use the advantages of iterative learning control. The experimental results validate the IRIT algorithm applied to a non-linear aerodynamic position control system. The results prove that the IRIT algorithm offers the significant control system performance improvement by few iterations and experiments conducted on the real-world process and model-free parameter tuning.,35
"This paper addresses the makespan minimization problem in scheduling flexible job shops whenever there exist separable sequence-dependent setup times. An extension to the neighborhood search functions of Mastrolilli and Gambradella, developed for the flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP), is provided. It is shown that under certain conditions such an extension is viable. Accordingly, a randomized neighborhood search function is introduced, and its best search parameters are determined experimentally using modified FJSP benchmark instances. A tabu search approach utilizing the proposed neighborhood search function is then developed, and experimentations are conducted using the modified instances to benchmark it against a lower bound. Experimental results show that on average, the tabu search approach is capable of achieving optimality gaps of below 10% for instances with low average setup time to processing time ratios.

"In this paper, we focus on the heavy-tailed stochastic signals generated through continuous-time autoregressive (CAR) models excited by infinite-variance alpha-stable processes. Our goal is to estimate the parameters of the continuous-time model, such as the autoregressive coefficients and the distribution parameters related to the excitation process for the alpha-stable CAR process with 0 < alpha < 2 based on the state-space representation. Likewise, we investigate the closed form expressions for the parameters of equivalent model in the discrete-time setting via regular samples of the process. We analyze the estimator based on the Monte Carlo simulations and illustrate the estimator consistency to the desired values when sampling frequency and sample size tend to infinity. We also apply the proposed method to the two types of real-world data, financial and ground magnetometer data, to evaluate its performance in real environments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Lump solutions are rationally localized in all directions in the space. A general class of lump solutions to the (2 + 1)-dimensional B-Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (BKP) equation is presented through symbolic computation with Maple. The Hirota bilinear form of the equation is the starting point in the computation process. Like the KP equation, the resulting lump solutions contain six arbitrary parameters. Two of the parameters are due to the translation invariances of the BKP equation with the independent variables, and the other four need to satisfy a nonzero determinant condition and the positivity condition, which guarantee analyticity and rational localization of the solutions.",24

Method: We retrieved information by searching databases from PubMed, CBM-disc, The Cochrane Library, Science-Direct (from Elsevier publishers) and Springer publishers up to March 2016. We looked for randomized controlled trials that studied ES in OB treatment with subject headings and keywords using literature searches and manual retrieval. References of included studies were reviewed. Literature was screened independently by two investigators according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. After extracting data and evaluating their quality, meta-analysis was undertaken with RevMan v5.2. Results: Ten randomized controlled trials involving 719 patients were included. Meta-analysis results demonstrated ES to have better effects for improving bladder compliance, reducing residual urine, and decreasing the frequency of enuresis in OB patients compared with the control group. ES elicited significantly better effects for diminishing the maximum detrusor pressure in children than in controls, but there was no significant difference in the maximum detrusor pressure between adults and controls. The therapeutic effect of ES combined with other therapies for increasing the maximum bladder capacity was better compared with other therapies alone. No significant difference was noted between ES alone and other therapies alone. Conclusions: Based on current evidence, ES has certain effects on OBs. Severe adverse reactions are not observed. ES is safe, efficacious, and worthy of clinical use.",17
"Plant diseases is one of the major bottlenecks in agricultural production that have bad effects on the economic of any country. Automatic detection of such disease could minimize these effects. Features selection is a usual pre-processing step used for automatic disease detection systems. It is an important process for detecting and eliminating noisy, irrelevant, and redundant data. Thus, it could lead to improve the detection performance. In this paper, an improved moth-flame approach to automatically detect tomato diseases was proposed. The moth-flame fitness function depends on the rough sets dependency degree and it takes into a consideration the number of selected features. The proposed algorithm used both of the power of exploration of the moth flame and the high performance of rough sets for the feature selection task to find the set of features maximizing the classification accuracy which was evaluated using the support vector machine (SVM). The performance of the MFORSFS algorithm was evaluated using many benchmark datasets taken from UCI machine learning data repository and then compared with feature selection approaches based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) with rough sets. The proposed algorithm was then used in a real-life problem, detecting tomato diseases (Powdery mildew and early blight) where a real dataset of tomato disease were manually built and a tomato disease detection approach was proposed and evaluated using this dataset. The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm was efficient in terms of Recall, Precision, Accuracy and F-Score, as long as feature size reduction and execution time.

"HIV stigma can inhibit uptake of HIV testing and antiretroviral therapy as well as negatively affect mental health. Efforts to reduce discrimination against people living with HIV (LWH) have contributed to greater acceptance of the infection. Female sex workers (FSW) LWH may experience overlapping stigma due to both their work and HIV status, although this is poorly understood. We examined HIV and sex-work stigma experienced by FSW LWH in Zimbabwe. Using the SAPPH-IRe cluster-randomised trial baseline survey, we analysed the data from 1039 FSW self-reporting HIV. The women were recruited in 14 sites using respondent-driven sampling. We asked five questions to assess internalised and experienced stigma related to working as a sex worker, and the same questions were asked in reference to HIV. Among all FSW, 91% reported some form of sex-work stigma. This was not associated with sociodemographic or sex-work characteristics. Rates of sex-work stigma were higher than those of HIV-related stigma. For example, 38% reported being talked badly about for LWH compared with 77% for their involvement in sex work. Those who reported any sex-work stigma also reported experiencing more HIV stigma compared to those who did not report sex-work stigma, suggesting a layering effect. FSW in Zimbabwe experience stigma for their role as immoral women and this appears more prevalent than HIV stigma. As HIV stigma attenuates, other forms of social stigma associated with the disease may persist and continue to pose barriers to effective care.",125
"Bent functions are maximally nonlinear Boolean functions with an even number of variables. They have attracted a lot of research for four decades because of their own sake as interesting combinatorial objects, and also because of their relations to coding theory, sequences and their applications in cryptography and other domains such as design theory. In this paper we investigate explicit constructions of bent functions which are linear on elements of spreads. After presenting an overview on this topic, we study bent functions which are linear on elements of presemifield spreads and give explicit descriptions of such functions for known commutative presemifields. A direct connection between bent functions which are linear on elements of the Desarguesian spread and oval polynomials over finite fields was proved by Carlet and the second author. Very recently, further nice extensions have been made by Carlet in another context. We introduce oval polynomials for semifields which are dual to symplectic semifields. In particular, it is shown that from a linear oval polynomial for a semifield one can get an oval polynomial for transposed semifield.",57
"Ethnopharmacological relevance: Kidney deficiency is the main pathogenesis of osteoporosis based on the theory of ""kidney governing bones"" in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Combined Herba Epimedii and Fructus Ligustri Lucidi, based on traditional Chinese formula Er-Zhi pills, were frequently used in TCM formulas that were prescribed for kidney tonifying and bone strengthening. However, it is unclear whether the combination of the two herbs may have a protective influence on glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP). The objective of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effects and the underlying molecular mechanism of the decoction and the active fractions of the combined herbs in GIOP rats. Materials and methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into seven groups, including the normal control (NC), GIOP model (MO), active fractions low (100 mg/kg, LAF), active fractions high (200 mg/kg, HAF), decoction low (3.5 g/kg, LD), decoction high (7 g/kg, HD) and Calcium with Vitamin D3 (0.2773 g/kg, CaD)-treated group. The GIOP model was established by intramuscular injection of dexamethasone (1 mg/kg) twice a week for 8 weeks. Different kinds of indicators were measured, including bone mineral density (BMD), bone biomechanical properties, serum bone alkaline phosphatase (b-ALP), serum bone y-carboxyglutamic acid containing protein (BGP), serum bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP) and serum carboxy terminal cross linked telopeptide of typelcollagen (ICTP), bone mineral content (BMC) and bone structured histomorphometry. The protein and mRNA expression of TGF-beta 1, Smad2, Smad3, Smad4 and Smad7 were detected by Western blotting (WB) and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), respectively. Results: Administration of combined Herba Epimedii and Fructus Ligustri Lucidi decoction and combined active fractions could significantly prevent GC-induced bone loss by increasing the contents of serum b-ALP, BGP and BMP-2 as the markers of bone formation, reducing the serum TRACP and ICTP contents to inhibit bone resorption and enhancing BMC. They could also attenuate biomechanical properties and BMD reduction, deterioration of trabecular architecture in MO rats. The mRNA and protein expressions of TGF-P1, smad2, smad3 and smad4 were up-regulated, and the mRNA and protein expression of Smad7 was down-regulated following combined Herba Epimedii and Fructus Ligustri Lucidi treatment. Conclusion: Combination of Herba Epimedii and Fructus Ligustri Lucidi exhibited protective effects on promoting bone formation and precluding bone resorption. The underlying mechanism may be attributed to its regulations on TGF-beta 1/Smads pathway. The substance bases of the combined herbs on anti-osteoporosis were total flavonoids of Herba Epimedii, total iridoids and flavonoids of Fructus Ligustri Lucidi.",16

"This paper is devoted to the comparison of the numerically simulated Chua's circuit and the real circuit. The aim of the research was to figure out the factors affecting the computer simulation accuracy, and to find the ways to improve it. It was discovered that the most influence is exerted by an inaccuracy of the nonlinear Chua's diode characteristic measurement, a numerical integration method used for simulation and the operational amplifier properties. A possibility of an analog circuit application as a source of an accurate signal in order to find the most appropriate numerical method for the chaotic systems simulation is shown.",60
"The new edge-directed interpolation (NEDI) algorithm is non-iterative and orientation adaptive. It achieves better edge performance in enhancing remote sensing images and natural images than conventional bi-linear and bi-cubic methods. It is also the theoretical foundation of many other complex regression and auto-regression interpolation methods. Although NEDI has impressive performance, its computation complexity is an obstacle to large-scale expansion. Parallel acceleration of NEDI provides strong versatility and extensibility. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained implementation for NEDI using GPU. In the fine-grained approach, we assign calculations of one unknown pixel to 2 x 2, 2 x 4, and 4 x 4 threads. Using NVIDIA TESLA K40C GPU for a case of asynchronous I/O transfer, our GPU optimization efforts using fine-grained NEDI can achieve a speedup of 99.09-fold when considering the I/O transfer time, compared with the original single-threaded C CPU code with the -O2 compiling optimization on Intel core (TM) i7-920. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our fine-grained scheme, we also compare the fine- and coarse-grained schemes by interpolating a 720p video to 1440p. Adopting the fine-grained scheme, we can achieve real-time display. The fine-grained parallel mode can be expanded to other algorithms based on regression and auto-regression schemes.

"An analog front-end (AFE) for a multifunction environmental sensor is proposed. The AFE is designed to be able to sense 1 mu V, 1 fC, and 1 pA level signals in a low-frequency band around DC, and consists of an instrumentation amplifier (IA), a charge amplifier (CA), and a continuous time delta-sigma (CT-Delta Sigma) ADC. To reduce the low-frequency noise of operational amplifier (OPAMP) which is used for signal path, this paper proposes a weak-inversion biasing technique. The designed IA achieved 26 nVrms input-referred noise (IRN) in the band of 0.1-10 Hz with 0.22 mm(2) die area. The designed CA achieved 25 aCrms IRN in charge sensing mode and 19 fArms IRN in current sensing mode in the band of 0.01-1 Hz, respectively, and occupies 0.12 mm(2) die area. The AFE has been fabricated in a 0.18 mu m CMOS process with 4.5 mm(2) die area. The current consumption at 2.56 kHz output data rate (ODR) is 2.5 mA, reducing to 2 mu A at 0.01 Hz ODR.",60
"High-valent Au(III) complexes have attracted much attention as catalysts in many reactions. Nevertheless Au(III) catalysts suffer from instability of the oxidized metal complexes during preparation and use. Herein, we demonstrated that Au(III) catalysts can be stabilized against reduction to metallic Au by modifying supported-ionic-liquid-phase-stabilized Au(III) catalyst with CuCl2. It was found that the that reduced Au could be re -oxidized in situ to Au3+ species by CuCl2 during the reaction and further stabilized by the electron transfer from Cu to these active species. When evaluated in the acetylene hydrochlorination reaction, the Au-Cu-IL/AC catalyst displayed an excellent specific activity with the turnover frequency (TOF) as high as 168.5 h(-1) and more than 99.8% selectivity fot the product, vinyl chloride (VCM). Furthermore, the Au-Cu-IL/AC catalyst demonstrated a stable catalytic performance with a negligible loss of C2H2 conversion after 500 h under typical industrial reaction conditions for acetylene hydrochlorination. Therefore, the findings of this work provide an efficient approach for designing stable high-valent metals for long-term operation, and also pave the way for the application of Au-Cu-IL/AC catalyst in industrial VCM production.

"Response inhibition is the ability to override a planned or an already initiated response. It is the hallmark of executive control as its deficits favour impulsive behaviours, which may be detrimental to an individual's life. This article reviews behavioural and computational guises of response inhibition. It focuses only on inhibition of oculomotor responses. It first reviews behavioural paradigms of response inhibition in eye movement research, namely the countermanding and antisaccade paradigms, both proven to be useful tools for the study of response inhibition in cognitive neuroscience and psychopathology. Then, it briefly reviews the neural mechanisms of response inhibition in these two behavioural paradigms. Computational models that embody a hypothesis and/or a theory of mechanisms underlying performance in both behavioural paradigms as well as provide a critical analysis of strengths and weaknesses of these models are discussed. All models assume the race of decision processes. The decision process in each paradigm that wins the race depends on different mechanisms. It has been shown that response latency is a stochastic process and has been proven to be an important measure of the cognitive control processes involved in response stopping in healthy and patient groups. Then, the inhibitory deficits in different brain diseases are reviewed, including schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Finally, new directions are suggested to improve the performance of models of response inhibition by drawing inspiration from successes of models in other domains. This article is part of the themed issue `Movement suppression: brain mechanisms for stopping and stillness'.",72
"Rigid water column (RWC) models simulate the unsteady-incompressible hydraulics of pressurized pipe networks. They conceptually lie between water hammer and quasi-steady models, yet despite their intrinsic strengths, existing RWC formulations suffer efficiency-, stability-, and interpretation-related challenges; thus, they are typically overlooked as a modeling alternative. To address the aforementioned limitations, this article presents the RWC global gradient algorithm (GGA), a novel formulation for pipe networks that has greater efficiency and overcomes the numerical challenges. The RWC GGA extends the generalized GGA (G-GGA) to consider inertial effects in addition to variable-area tanks and mixed (i.e., demand and pressure-dependent) outflows. Two pipe networks of simple and moderate complexity are used to compare the new approach against two other RWC algorithms, the G-GGA, and a water hammer model: the current work is shown to have improved stability and efficiency relative to previous work. The RWC GGA is also found to have a computational cost only slightly greater than that of the G-GGA for the same time-step size. Overall, this work highlights the practical utility of RWC models to simulate slow transient events and controlled operations.",83
"While the data deluge accelerates, most of the data produced remains locked in deep Web databases. For the linked open data to benefit from the potential represented by this huge amount of data, it is crucial to come up with solutions to expose heterogeneous databases as linked data. The xR2RML mapping language is an endeavor towards this goal: it is designed to map various types of databases to RDF, by flexibly adapting to heterogeneous query languages and data models while remaining free from any specific language. It extends R2RML, the W3C recommendation for the mapping of relational databases to RDF, and relies on RML for the handling of various data formats. In this paper we present xR2RML, we analyse data models of several modern databases as well as the format in which query results are returned, and we show how xR2RML translates any result data element into RDF, relying on existing languages such as XPath and JSONPath when necessary. We illustrate some features of xR2RML such as the generation of RDF collections and containers, and the ability to deal with mixed data formats. We also describe a real-world use case in which we applied xR2RML to build a SKOS thesaurus aimed at supporting studies on History of Zoology, Archaeozoology and Conservation Biology.",112
"Background: Suicide rates are higher in veterans compared to the general population, perhaps due to trauma exposure. Previous literature highlights depressive symptoms and anger as contributors to suicide risk. PTSD symptoms may indirectly affect suicide risk by increasing the severity of such cognitive-emotional factors. Method: A sample of community dwelling veterans (N=545) completed online surveys, including the PTSD Checklist-Military Version, Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised, Multidimensional Health ProfilePsychosocial Functioning, and Differential Emotions Scale -Iv. Bivariate and serial mediation analyses were conducted to test for direct and indirect effects of PTSD symptoms on suicide risk. Results: In bivariate analyses, PTSD symptoms, depression, anger, and internal hostility were positively related to suicide risk. In serial mediation analyses, there was a significant total effect of PTSD symptoms on suicide risk in both models. PTSD symptoms were also indirectly related to suicidal behavior via depression and internal hostility, and via internal hostility alone. Anger was not a significant mediator. Limitation: Our cross-sectional sample was predominantly White and male; prospective studies with diverse veterans are needed. Discussion: Our findings may have implications for veteran suicide prevention. The effects of PTSD and depression on anger, particularly internal hostility, are related to suicide risk, suggesting a potential mechanism of action for the PTSD-suicide linkage. A multi-faceted therapeutic approach, targeting depression and internal hostility, via cognitive-behavioral techniques such as behavioral activation and cognitive restructuring, may reduce suicide risk in veterans who have experienced trauma.",69
This case report describes a novel technique of restoring endodontically treated teeth. Hidden caries causing irreversible pulpitis in a mandibular molar with Radix Entomolaris (RE) was evident. The intact occlusal surface anatomy was duplicated before preparing an access cavity to replicate the original occlusal surface in the post endodontic restoration using (Computer-Aided Design and Computer-Aided Manufacturing) CAD/CAM technique.

"Objective: While there is general agreement that patient education is essential for compliance, no objective tools exist to assess knowledge in children and parents of children with endocrine disorders. We aimed to design and validate a Pediatric Endocrine Knowledge Assessment Questionnaire (PEKAQ) for congenital hypothyroidism, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, isolated growth hormone deficiency, Graves' disease, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. We evaluated baseline knowledge of children and parents of children with these disorders and assessed impact of educational intervention. Methods: At baseline, 77 children (12-18 years) and 162 parents of children 1-18 years participated in this prospective intervention study. Educational handouts for five targeted disorders were designed. Following one-on-one educational intervention, 55 children and 123 parents participated. Baseline and post-intervention knowledge scores were compared using McNemar's test. Results: Adequate multi-rater Kappa measure of agreement was achieved for children's (0.70) and parent's (0.75) PEKAQs. Flesch Reading Ease Score for both PEKAQs (15 questions each) was 65. Post-intervention, significantly higher proportion of parents and children answered majority of questions correctly (p<0.05). Sixteen percent more parents and 22% more children knew their diagnosis correctly (p<0.05). Significant improvement was noted among all participants regarding reason for treatment, steps to take in a situation of missed dose, exercise and diet with these disorders, and long-term prognosis. Parent's knowledge score was an independent predictor of child's score. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first validated PEKAQ that can be used widely in pediatric endocrinology clinics. We noted significant improvement in knowledge of children and parents of children with endocrine disorders.",133
"Verticillium dahliae is an economically relevant soilborne pathogen that causes vascular wilt in several crops, including pepper (Capsicum annuum). Fungal infection is usually visualized as a vascular browning, likely due to the onset of phenylpropanoid metabolism, which also seems to play a crucial role in the tolerance of some pepper varieties. In the current work, the potential function of distinct phenylpropanoid derivatives (suberin, lignin and phenolic compounds) in the pepper tolerance response against V. dahliae, was investigated. Histochemical and biochemical analyses ruled out suberin as a key player in the pepper-fungus interaction. However, changes observed in lignin composition and higher deposition of bound phenolics in infected stems seemed to contribute to the reinforcement of cell walls and the impairment of V. dahliae colonization. Most importantly, this is the first time that the accumulation of the hydroxycinnamic acid amide N-feruloyltyramine was reported in pepper stems in response to a vascular fungus. Fungitoxic activity for that hydroxycinnamate-tyramine conjugate was demonstrated as well. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",126
"Full human body shape scans provide valuable data for a variety of applications including anthropometric surveying, clothing design, human-factors engineering, health, and entertainment. However, the high price, large volume, and difficulty of operating professional 3-D scanners preclude their use in home entertainment. Recently, portable low-cost red green blue-depth cameras such as the Kinect have become popular for computer vision tasks. However, the infrared mechanism of this type of camera leads to noisy and incomplete depth images. We construct a stereo full-body scanning environment composed of multiple depth cameras and propose a novel registration algorithm. Our algorithm determines a segment constrained correspondence for two neighboring views, integrating them using rigid transformation. Furthermore, it aligns all of the views based on uniform error distribution. The generated 3-D mesh model is typically sparse, noisy, and even with holes, which makes it lose surface details. To address this, we introduce a geometric and topological fitting prior in the form of a professionally designed high-resolution template model. We formulate a template deformation optimization problem to fit the high-resolution model to the low-quality scan. Its solution overcomes the obstacles posed by different poses, varying body details, and surface noise. The entire process is free of body and template markers, fully automatic, and achieves satisfactory reconstruction results.",0
"For hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), regenerative braking might be the most effective way of energy conservation. However, the braking energy usually cannot be regenerated completely due to the limit of the motor maximum torque. When the braking torque provided by electric motor (EM) cannot meet the driver's braking demand, the hydraulic brake system should provide extra braking torque, which results in braking energy loss. Therefore, it is meaningful adjusting EM work point to maximize the regenerative energy by transmission downshifting. In this paper, an HEV equipped with an automated manual transmission (AMT) is chosen as the study platform. First, simplified dynamic models of HEV system are built. Then, the process and advantages of AMT downshifting are analyzed and the characteristics of regenerative braking are obtained with different gear positions and different, of which two kinds of downshifting strategy are proposed on basis. At last, hardware-in-loop tests are carried out, and results show that the energy conservation of regenerative braking process with downshifting can be increased by 10.5-32.4% compared to that without downshifting.

"Background Current studies report mixed results in health status and health behaviors after a diagnosis of cancer. The aim of our study is to investigate potential differences in lifestyle factors among cancer survivors and cancer-free individuals in a prospective cohort study conducted in the United States. Methods Using data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Trial, 10,133 cancer survivors were identified and compared to 81,992 participants without cancer to evaluate differences in body mass index (BMI), smoking, NSAID use, and physical activity. Results Cancer survivors, compared to the cancer-free, were significantly less likely to engage in physical activity (odds ratio (OR) = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.77-0.88). Compared to those who were obese at baseline, cancer survivors were more likely to be at normal BMI at follow-up compared to the cancer-free (OR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.42-2.54). Cancer survivors were less likely to report regular aspirin use as compared to the cancer-free population (OR = 0.86, 95 % CI = 0.82-0.92). Of the current smokers, cancer survivors were more likely to be former smokers at follow-up compared to the cancer-free (OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.30-1.74). Conclusion Upon stratification by baseline health markers, cancer survivors practice healthier lifestyle habits such as smoking cessation and maintenance of a healthy weight. However, cancer survivors are less likely to be physically active as compared to cancer-free individuals, regardless of baseline practices. Implications for cancer survivors For cancer survivors who reported poor health status and behaviors at baseline, a cancer diagnosis may encourage the practice of healthier lifestyle behaviors.",26
"Recently, many studies have shown the potential use of circulating exosomes as novel biomarkers for monitoring and predicting a number of complex diseases, including cancer. However, reliable and cost-effective detection of exosomes in routine clinical settings, still remain a difficult task, mainly due to the lack of adequately easy and fast assay platforms. Therefore, we demonstrate here the development of a visible and simple method for the detection of exosomes by integrating single-walled carbon nanotubes that being excellent water solubility (s-SWCNTs) and aptamer. Aptamers, specific to exosomes transmembrane protein CD63, are absorbed onto the surface of s-SWCNTs and improve the minic peroxidase activity of s-SWCNT5, which can efficiently catalyze H2O2-mediated oxidation of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and lead to a change from colorless to blue in solution. However, after adding exosomes, the aptamers are bound with CD63, leaving from the surface of s-SWCNTs through conformational changes, which results the color of solution from deep to moderate, and this can be observed by the naked eye and monitored by UV vis spectrometry. Under optimal conditions, the linear range of exosomes is estimated to be 1.84x10(6) to 2.21x10(7) particles/mu L with a detection of limit (LOD) of 5.2x10(5) particles/mu L. Consequently, a visible and simple approach detecting exosomes is successfully constructed. Moreover, this proposed colorimetric aptasensor can be universally applicable for the detection of other targets by simple change the aptamer.",14
"Despite significant advances in materials and manufacturing techniques applied to sports protective equipment in recent years, sports injuries due to impact, contusions in particular, continue to occur. In this paper, a test methodology aimed at collecting data from laboratory-simulated human-on-human impacts in Basketball is presented. The study was executed in three stages with data being collected from: i) human on instrumented bag; ii) impactor on instrumented bag and iii) impactor on instrumented human impacts. In all cases, high-speed video and/or kinematic motion data capture systems were used to obtain parameters such as inbound/outbound velocities, contact durations while resistive ink technology pressure sensing films were used to estimate parameters such as pressure distributions, peak pressures, contact areas, impact forces. Elite-level athletes were used in all human trials to ensure that impact techniques and levels representative of the elite game were obtained and that tolerance to impacts was similarly representative. Two common strikes were simulated: knee on thigh and elbow on rib/torso. Five participants were used to collect the human-on-bag data while 12 participants were used to collect the impactor-on-human data. Between three and five impacts per scenario were performed to enable noise averaging and, importantly, likely injury-causing outlier capture. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"This paper approaches the problem of output power prediction for an off-shore wind park. To this end, a so called wind deficiency factor for each turbine and for each wind direction sector is identified using past data. This identification is done by using the effective wind speed concept that can establish a link between output power of each wind turbine and meteorological mast measures in terms of wind speed and direction. Based on forecast wind speed and direction, a wind park simulator that uses the previously identified deficiency factors, computes future output power time evolutions. Nunierical simulations show the feasibility of the proposed approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",49
"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are a growing subset of the emerging Internet of Things (IoT). WSNs reduce the cost of deployment over wired alternatives; consequently, use is increasing in home automation, critical infrastructure, smart metering, and security solutions. Few published works evaluate the security of proprietary WSN protocols due to the lack of low-cost and effective research tools. One such protocol is ITU-T G. 9959-based Z-Wave, which maintains wide acceptance within the IoT market. Concurrently, the use of software-defined radios (SDRs) is experiencing significant growth due to lowcost and open-source platforms. Using SDRs, network security professionals are able to evaluate WSNs and identify avenues of attack which historically required large investments in RF equipment and specialized skill sets. Recent work introduces Scapy-radio, a generic SDR-based wireless monitor/injection tool, designed to simplify the development of penetration testing capabilities for wireless networks. Other works demonstrate methods for fingerprinting transceivers for the IEEE 802.11b and IEEE 802.15.4 standards by analyzing packet reception rates when preamble lengths are manipulated. This work significantly expands Scapy-radio, providing broad support for the Z-Wave protocol using the low-cost HackRF SDR to investigate cooperative and non-cooperative fingerprinting techniques. Specifically, this work demonstrates transceiver type fingerprinting through experimental analysis of packet reception with respect to preamble length across eight devices from five manufactures, utilizing the two most widely-used Z-Wave transceivers. Furthermore, this work presents EZ-Wave, a set of Z-Wave network reconnaissance tools capable of network discovery and enumeration, device fingerprinting, and gathering device status information. Herein this work successfully demonstrates methods for conducting network reconnaissance on a Z-Wave Home Area Network and transceiver type fingerprinting through preamble manipulation with greater than 99% accuracy.",46
"Ethnopharmacological relevance: The root of Saussurea costus (Aucklandia lappa Decne, Aucklandiae Radix, SC) and Thuja orientalis L. (TOL) have been traditionally used as anti-inflammatory agents in Korea. However, they have not been studied for the efficacy of atopic dermatitis (AD) treatment, a chronic inflammatory skin disease. We investigated the efficacy of topical applications with 1,3-butyleneglycol extracts of SC and TOL to alleviate the symptoms of AD. Materials and methods: HaCaT cells and the dorsal skin of Nc/Nga mice had a local exposure of house mite extracts and 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), respectively. After lesions developed, we topically applied 1,3-butylen glycol (vehicle; control), SC (30%), TOL (30%), or SC (15%)+TOL (15%) to the skin lesions for 5 weeks. The normal-control was not exposed to DNCB. The skin thickness, mast cell infiltration, serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) and IgG1 and gene expressions of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, and IFN-gamma in the dorsal skin and HaCaT cells were measured. Results: Chlorogenic acid (129.6 +/- 10.2 mu g/g) for SC and catechin and apigenin (93.4 +/- 13.2 and 16.9 +/- 1.3 mu g/g, respectively) for TOL were used as indicator compounds for the strength of the extracts. SC+TOL decreased the expression of protease-activated receptor-2 and ICAM-1 and the release of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in HaCaT cells activated by 3 mu g/mL house mite extracts in comparison to either of SC or TOL alone. In Nc/Nga mice challenged with DNCB, SC+TOL synergistically attenuated clinical symptoms of AD such as erythema, hemorrhage, edema, excoriation and dryness in the dorsal skin better than either SC or TOL alone. Histological analysis of the dorsal skin also showed that SC+TOL treatment significantly and additively decreased the inflammatory cellular infiltrate, including mast cells and eosinophils in comparison to either of SC or TOL. SC+TOL also decreased serum IgE and IgG1 levels and the expression of IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-13 mRNA in dorsal skin in DNCB-treated Nc/Nga mice. Conclusion: SC+TOL relieved the symptoms of AD by reducing pro-inflammatory activity and over-activated immune responses. These data suggest that SC+TOL may be an effective alternative intervention for the management of AD.",110
"Purpose: To evaluate characteristics of nonresearch industry payments to radiologists and associations with regional diagnostic imaging utilization. Methods: Using 2014 CMS Open Payment data, all disclosed nonresearch-related industry payments to radiologists were identified. Health Resources and Services Administration Area Health Resources Files were used to identify actual and population-weighted numbers of radiologists by state. Utilizing the 5% random beneficiary sample CMS Research Identifiable Files from 2014, average Medicare imaging spending per beneficiary in each state was calculated. Average frequency and dollar amounts of nonresearch non royalty payments to radiologists were calculated at the state level. Using the Pearson correlation coefficient, the relationship between frequency and amounts of nonresearch payments to radiologists versus per-beneficiary Medicare imaging spending was evaluated at the state level. Results: Overall', 2,008 radiologists (1,670 diagnostic, 338 interventional) received nonresearch nonroyalty payments from industry, representing 5.2% of all 38,857 radiologists nationwide. A total of 4,975 individual transfers translated to 2.5 +/- 1.3 discrete payments per receiving radiologist with a mean of $432 +/- $1,976 (median $26; range $1-$34,050). Food and beverage expenses constituted the vast majority of disclosed transfers (4,111; 83%), followed by travel and lodging (444; 9%), consulting fees (279; 6%), and educational expenses (51; 1%). Considerable geographic variation in payments was observed, ranging from 0% of radiologists in Vermont to 12.9% in the District of Columbia. No correlation was identified between average per-beneficiary Medicare imaging spending and the proportion of nonresearch-funded radiologists in each state (r = 0.06). Similarly, no correlation was identified between average per beneficiary Medicare imaging spending and the average nonresearch transfer amount to radiologists in each state (r =-0.08). Conclusions: In 2014, only a small minority of United States radiologists received nonresearch payments from industry. At the state level, medical imaging utilization does not seem to be influenced by such financial relationships.",8
"Finding pharmaceutically relevant target conformations from an arbitrary set of protein conformations remains a challenge in structure-based virtual screening (SBVS). The growth in the number of available conformations, either experimentally determined or computationally derived, obscures the situation further. While the inflated conformation space potentially contains viable druggable targets, the increase of conformational complexity, as a consequence, poses a selection problem. To address this challenge, we took advantage of machine learning methods, namely an over-sampling and a binary classification procedure, and present a novel method to select druggable receptor conformations. Specifically, we trained a binary classifier on a set of nuclear receptor conformations, wherein each conformation was labeled with an enrichment measure for a corresponding SBVS. The classifier enabled us to formulate suggestions and identify enriching SBVS targets for six of seven nuclear receptors. Further, the classifier can be extended to other proteins of interest simply by feeding new training data sets to the classifier. Our work, thus, provides a methodology to identify pharmaceutically interesting receptor conformations for nuclear receptors and other drug targets.",1
"Nanotechnology application to concrete presents an innovative approach to improve concrete properties based on the ability to manipulate the cementitious material at an atomic scale. This paper presents a review of the nano-materials that have been used in concrete. The literature survey revealed that four nano-materials are most often used to modify concrete properties; these include nano-silica (nano-SiO2), nano-titanium dioxide (nano-TiO2), carbon nano-tubes (CNTs) and carbon nano-fibres (CNFs). All of these four nano-materials have shown improvement in many concrete properties. Both nano-TiO2 and nano-SiO2 reduce bleeding and segregation, and improve mechanical and transport properties. CNFs and CNTs tend to adversely affect the fresh properties due to agglomerations, which are overcome when a surfactant or ultrasonic mixer is used. However, both CNFs and CNTs significantly improve the mechanical properties of concrete. This paper also discusses how concrete durability is improved when nano-materials are added to concrete. In addition, this paper identifies several research needs based on the gaps in the current state of knowledge on using nano-materials in concrete.",103
"Fatty acids, which are well-known for their influence on human metabolism and signal transduction, are also a substantial component of cellular membranes and regulate the basic properties and functions of membranes. Owing to their multiple functions, fatty acid profiles of cell membranes are of great interest to those who are studying the relationship between membrane biochemical compositions and functions. A HCl-catalyzed derivation method and a gas chromatography with mass spectrometry analysis method were developed to accurately profile the fatty acids in cell membranes of erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets. The detection limits of all 35 fatty acids ranged from 0.58 to 22 ng/mL and the limits of quantitation were between 2.1 and 72 ng/mL. Finally, the established method was used to profile the membrane fatty acids of 44 healthy volunteers from the north and south of China. Results revealed significant differences in the fatty acid profiles from the two regions, particularly those of the erythrocytes. This technique may be applied to cell membrane studies to generate new biological hypotheses concerning fatty acid composition and membrane functions as well as to construct related disease profiles.",32
"Background and ObjectiveThe cytokine, interleukin (IL)-32, is a relatively new discovery. However, it is very powerful for stimulating tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) under inflammatory conditions. The objective of this research was to explore fluctuations in the levels of TNF-, IL-32 and IL-10, in both saliva and gingival crevicular fluid. The focus was on measurements taken before and after clinical treatment of chronic periodontitis. Material and MethodsFor the purposes of the study, a total of 27 patients with chronic periodontitis and 27 controls (periodontally healthy) were recruited. Important clinical periodontal criteria were established before and 4 wk after the start of the research. The chronic periodontitis group was given an initial form of periodontal care. Samples of saliva and gingival crevicular fluid were collected exactly 4 wk preceding and 4 wk following the care. The levels of IL-10, IL-32 and TNF- present in saliva and gingival crevicular fluid were recorded via the use of an ELISA. ResultsAt baseline, the levels of TNF- and IL-32 in the gingival crevicular fluid and saliva were significantly higher among patients in the chronic periodontitis group than among patients in the control group (p < 0.05). On the other hand, at baseline the levels of IL-10 were significantly lower in the gingival crevicular fluid and saliva of the chronic periodontitis group than the control group (p < 0.05). A significantly positive link was found between the TNF- and IL-32 levels in the two study groups (p < 0.05). After treatment, the levels of TNF- and IL-32 in saliva and gingival crevicular fluid were significantly lower in the chronic periodontitis group when compared with the baseline readings. However, the levels of IL-10 were significantly higher (p < 0.05). ConclusionUltimately, the level of IL-32 present in saliva and gingival crevicular fluid might be useful as an indicator of the condition and the expectations for its treatment and care. According to the results of the research, the proinflammatory impact of IL-32 could potentially be linked to the intensity and progression of periodontitis.",23
"Hydrogen peroxide, one of the reactive oxygen species (ROS), can cause intracellular oxidative stress associated with skin aging and/or photoaging. Curcumin, a polyphenol in turmeric, has been reported to exhibit biological activity. In this study, five naturally occurring curcuminoids [curcumin, demethoxycurcumin (DMC), bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC), monohydroxy-DMC, and monohydroxy-BDMC] were used to investigate their protective roles against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress in the immortalized human keratinocyte cell lines (HaCaT cells). These five curcuminoids at 10 mu M, but not at 5 mu M, were shown to exhibit cytotoxicities toward HaCaT keratinocytes. Therefore, a 5 mu M concentration of the five curcuminoids was selected for further investigations. Cells were pretreated with or without curcuminoids for 2.5 h before 24-h hydrogen peroxide (150 M) treatments. Pretreatments with the minor components monohydroxy-DMC or monohydroxy-BDMC, but not curcumin, DMC, and BDMC, showed protective activity, elevating cell viability compared to cells with direct hydrogen peroxide treatments. Pretreatments with monohydroxy-DMC and monohydroxy-BDMC showed the best protective effects, reducing apoptotic cell populations and intracellular ROS, as demonstrated by flow cytometry, as well as reducing the changes of the mitochondrial membrane potential compared to cells with direct hydrogen peroxide treatments. The pretreatments with monohydroxy-DMC and monohydroxy-BDMC reduced c-jun and c-fos mRNA expression and p53 tumor suppressor protein expression and increased HO-1 protein expression and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, respectively, compared to cells with direct hydrogen peroxide treatments. The five curcuminoids exhibited similar hydrogen peroxide-scavenging activity in vitro. It was proposed that monohydroxy-DMC and monohydroxy-BDMC could induce antioxidant defense systems better than curcumin, DMC, or BDMC could against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis of HaCaT keratinocytes and that they may have potential as ingredients in antiaging cosmetics for skin care.",114
"HIV susceptibility linked to hormonal contraception (HC) has been studied before, but with mixed results. Reports from some of the recent findings have prompted the World Health Organisation to encourage women who use HC to concurrently use condoms in order to prevent HIV infection in the light of possible increased HIV risk of infection associated with hormone-based contraceptives. A two-sex HIV model classifying women into three risk groups consisting of individuals who use condoms, natural methods, and hormone-based contraceptives is formulated and analysed to assess the possible effects of various birth control strategies on the transmission dynamics of the disease. Our model results showed that women who use HC could be key drivers of the epidemic and that their increased infectivity may be critical in driving the epidemic. Women who use hormone-based contraceptives potentially act as a core group from which men get infected and in turn transmit the disease to other population groups. We fitted the model to HIV prevalence data for Zimbabwe reported by UNAIDS and Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care and used the model fit to project HIV prevalence. Predictions using HIV data for Zimbabwe suggest that a hypothesised increase in susceptibility and infectivity of two-, three-, and fourfold would result in a 25, 50, and 100% increase in baseline HIV prevalence projection, respectively, thus suggesting possible increased disease burden even in countries reporting plausible HIV prevalence declines. Although a possible causal relationship between HIV susceptibility and HC use remains subject of continuing scientific probe, its inclusion as part of birth control strategy has been shown in this study, to possibly increase HIV transmission. If proven, HC use may potentially explain the inordinate spread of HIV within the sub-Saharan Africa region and therefore compel for urgent assessment with a view to reorienting birth control methods in use in settings with generalised epidemics.",116
"Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that the major depression disorder would increase the risk of dementia in the older with amnestic cognitive impairment. We used granger causality analysis algorithm to explore the amygdala-and hippocampus-based directional connectivity patterns in 12 patients with major depression disorder and amnestic cognitive impairment (mean age: 69.5 +/- 10.3 years), 13 amnestic cognitive impairment patients (mean age: 72.7 +/- 8.5 years) and 14 healthy controls (mean age: 64.7 +/- 7.0 years). Compared with amnestic cognitive impairment patients and control groups respectively, the patients with both major depression disorder and amnestic cognitive impairment displayed increased effective connectivity from the right amygdala to the right lingual and calcarine gyrus, as well as to the bilateral supplementary motor areas. Meanwhile, the patients with both major depression disorder and amnestic cognitive impairment had enhanced effective connectivity from the left superior parietal gyrus, superior and middle occipital gyrus to the left hippocampus, the z values of which was also correlated with the scores of mini-mental state examination and auditory verbal learning test-immediate recall. Our findings indicated that the directional effective connectivity of right amygdala - occipital-parietal lobe - left hippocampus might be the pathway by which major depression disorder inhibited the brain activity in patients with amnestic cognitive impairment.",119
"A new class of soft-matter actuator, the liquid crystal elastomer (LCE), shows promise for application in a wide variety of mechanical microsystems. Frequently referred to as an ` artificial muscle', this family of materials exhibits large actuation stroke and generates considerable force, in a compact form which may easily be combined with the structures and devices commonly used in microsystems and MEMS. We show here how standard microfabrication techniques may be used to integrate LCEs into mechanical microsystems and present an in-depth analysis of their mechanical and actuation properties. Using an example from micro-optics and optical MEMS, we demonstrate that their performance and flexibility allows realization of entirely new types of tunable optical functionality.",89
"In this paper the authors present a method which facilitates computationally efficient parameter estimation of dynamical systems from a continuously growing set of measurement data. It is shown that the proposed method, which utilises Sequential Monte Carlo samplers, is guaranteed to be fully parallelisable (in contrast to Markov chain Monte Carlo methods) and can be applied to a wide variety of scenarios within structural dynamics. Its ability to allow convergence of one's parameter estimates, as more data is analysed, sets it apart from other sequential methods (such as the particle filter). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Computationally intensive digital signal processing (DSP) systems sometimes have real time requirements beyond that which programmable processor platform solutions, consisting of RISC and DSP processors, can achieve. The addition of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) components to these platforms provides a configurable hardware resource where increased parallelism levels allow very large computational rates. Techniques to implement circuit architectures from signal flow graph (SFG) algorithm expression can produce highly efficient processor implementations. Applying folding transformations produces implementations where hardware resource usage is reduced at the possible expense of throughput. In this paper a new development methodology is presented which analyses the SFG algorithm to suggest appropriate folding techniques. By characterizing different folding techniques, a template circuit architecture can be created early in the design process which does not alter throughout the remainder of the implementation process. Retiming techniques applied to the algorithm SFG produces the properly timed implementation from the template. By applying this methodology, architectural exploration can be quickly and efficiently performed to generate a set of implementations (an 'implementation space') to best meet the constraints of the system. When applied to a Normalised Lattice Filter design example, the results demonstrate high savings on FPGA resource usage, with little reduction in real time performance, demonstrating the implementation advantage of employing this methodology.",56
"Polluted insulators frequently face flashover accident and it threatens the safety and stability of power system. In order to help to reduce the occurrence of flashover, it is necessary to study the contamination characteristics of insulators and its influence factors. In this study, the contamination of insulator is simulated by the Eulerian multiphase model in computational fluid dynamics. The flow field around insulators is calculated and the volume fraction of the particle phase is used to characterise the pollution degree on insulator surface. Results show that the pollution is mainly distributed on windward side and leeward side of insulator. The crosswind side of insulator is slightly contaminated. The four influence factors, wind velocity, particle concentration, particle diameter and flow angle have different effects on insulator contamination. Among these factors the particle concentration contributes most to the whole contamination degree of insulators. A wind tunnel contamination test on insulator is carried out to verify the feasibility of the numerical simulation. It can be found that simulated contamination distribution and variation of contamination degree with wind velocity well coincide with the results of wind tunnel test. The numerical simulation in this study is practical in studying the insulator contamination.",86
"The solution of large sparse systems of linear constraints is at the base of most interactive solvers for physically-based animation of soft body dynamics. We focus on applications with hard and tight per-frame resource budgets, such as video games, where the solution of soft body dynamics needs to be computed in a few milliseconds. Linear iterative methods are preferred in these cases since they provide approximate solutions within a given error tolerance and in a short amount of time. We present a parallel randomized Gauss-Seidel method which can be effectively employed to enable the animation of 3D soft objects discretized as large and irregular triangular or tetrahedral meshes. At the beginning of each frame, we partition the set of equations governing the system using a randomized graph coloring algorithm. The unknowns in the equations belonging to the same partition are independent of each other. Then, all the equations belonging to the same partition are solved at the same time in parallel. Our algorithm runs completely on the GPU and can support changes in the constraints topology. We tested our method as a solver for soft body dynamics within the Projective Dynamics and Position Based Dynamics frameworks. We show how the algorithmic simplicity of this iterative strategy enables great numerical stability and fast convergence speed, which are essential features for physically based animations with fixed and small hard time budgets. Compared to the state of the art, we found our method to be faster and scale better while providing stabler solutions for very small time budgets.",101
"The role of the endocannabinoid system in nicotine addiction is being increasingly acknowledged. Acute inhibition of anandamide (AEA) degradation efficiently reduces nicotine withdrawal-induced affective symptoms in rats and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the degradation enzyme of AEA, has been proposed as a possible treatment against nicotine addiction. However, it is unclear whether chronic inhibition of AEA during nicotine abstinence will have beneficial or deleterious affective side-effects. Using a rat model of nicotine addiction, we found that, during abstinence, rats injected daily with a FAAH inhibitor (URB597) developed a depressive-like phenotype. Our results show that in the nicotine abstinent rats, URB597 induced low saccharin consumption, persistent immobility in the forced swim test and increased corticosterone levels in response to stress. In addition, URB597decreased CB1 receptor binding and activity in the habenula, a key structure in the control of nicotine-related emotional states. In contrast, non-treated abstinent rats showed increased CB1 receptor activity and behaviors comparable to controls. No FAAH inhibition-induced alterations were observed in animals that had a previous history of saline self-administration. Taken together, our results suggest that chronic FAAH inhibition prevents the homeostatic adaptations of habenular CB1 receptor function that are necessary for the recovery from nicotine dependence.

"NK cell cytotoxicity is a widely used measure to determine the effect of outside intervention on NK cell function. However, the accuracy and reproducibility of this assay can be considered unstable, either because of user's errors or because of the sensitivity of NK cells to experimental manipulation. To eliminate these issues, a workflow that reduces them to a minimum was established and is presented here. To illustrate, we obtained blood samples, at various time points, from runners (n = 4) that were submitted to an intense bout of exercise. First, NK cells are simultaneously identified and isolated through CD56 tagging and magnetic-based sorting, directly from whole blood and from as little as one milliliter. The sorted NK cells are removed of any reagent or capping antibodies. They can be counted in order to establish an accurate NK cell count per milliliter of blood. Secondly, the sorted NK cells (effectors cells or E) can be mixed with 3,3'-Diotadecyloxacarbocyanine Perchlorate (DiO) tagged K562 cells (target cells or T) at an assay-optimal 1: 5 T: E ratio, and analyzed using an imaging flow-cytometer that allows for the visualization of each event and the elimination of any false positive or false negatives (such as doublets or effector cells). This workflow can be completed in about 4 h, and allows for very stable results even when working with human samples. When available, research teams can test several experimental interventions in human subjects, and compare measurements across several time points without compromising the data's integrity.",33
"Objective. To evaluate in patients with AS (i) the fluctuation in self-reported disease activity (BASDAI), patient global well-being [visual analogue scale (VAS)-global] and spinal pain (VAS-pain) during 2 years of follow-up on a group level and (ii) the clinical relevance of these fluctuations on a patient level. Methods. Dutch patients from the Outcome in AS International Study cohort completed patient-reported outcome measures every 2 months over 2 years. On the group level, mixed linear models were used to analyse whether the outcome measures were constant over time. On a patient level, relevant changes in scores were assessed by the frequency in which changes would exceed predefined cut-off values (>1.0 or >2.0 on a 0-10 scale) during the 2 years of follow-up using 2-, 4-, 6-, 12- or 24-month assessments. Results. Ninety patients [median age 47.3 years (s.d. 11.4), 67.8% male, symptom duration 25.2 years (s.d. 11.3)] were included. On the group level, the outcome measures remained constant over time. However, large fluctuations were found on the patient level. For example, using 2 month intervals, 92% and 69% of the patients had at least one change of >1.0 or >2.0, respectively, in the BASDAI during the 2 year follow-up. When prolonging the interval, the proportion of changes exceeding the cut-off decreased, indicating that information is lost. Similar results were found for the VAS-global and VAS-pain. Conclusion. Substantial fluctuations in BASDAI, VAS-global and VAS-pain were found in individuals over time. With longer intervals, fewer fluctuations were observed, indicating that relevant changes might be missed.",107
"This study aimed to evaluate the isoflavone and total phenolic contents in kefir-fermented soymilk storage and after the in vitro digestive system simulation (DSS). Soymilk was fermented with kefir culture (0.02 UC/L) at 25 degrees C for 15 h and stored at 4 degrees C for 4 days. After the fermentation and storage, the isoflavone and total phenolic contents were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography and spectrophotometry, respectively. The cell viability of lactic acid bacteria and yeast was evaluated. Fermentation promoted an increase of approximately 3 log CFU/g cycles of the microorganisms and the storage process did not alter the aglycone isoflavones and total phenolic contents. The content of aglycone isoflavones increased 2-fold, and the total phenolic content increased 9-fold. Therefore, kefir-fermented soymilk is a good source of aglycone isoflavones and phenolics, since the content of these substances was increased significantly after the in vitro digestive system simulation of the product.

"The filter media in polyester is one of the most geotextile materials used in aerosol and drainage filtration, particularly for soil reinforcement in civil engineering due to its appropriate properties and its low cost. However, the current understanding of the durability and stability of this material in real service conditions, especially under severe long-term conditions are completely limited. This work presents an investigation of the chemical aging of a commercial nonwoven polyester membrane under different temperatures and pH environments in relation to its morphology, mechanical properties and molar mass. The results showed a significant reduction of mechanical properties in term of tensile strength, puncture resistance and tearing forces of the membrane after aging process due to the chemical degradation. The molar mass and mechanical properties changes with temperature and pH showed a complex dependence of material properties on environmental conditions. Based on the obtained results, the lifetime of the material at different temperatures was determined by the use of the Arrhenius model. These results provide useful information to a better understanding of phenomena occurring during chemical aging of the polyester nonwoven membranes and may help to predict the service lifetime of this material in conditions of use encounteredin service.

"The Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (TMCF) is a hydrologically unique and highly vulnerable ecosystem to changes in land-use and climate. Assessing the impacts of these changes needs to consider soil-water dynamics. In particular, the organic layer and its functioning requires attention because its difference in water retention characteristics and root density compared to the underlying mineral soils. A higher root density and a higher water storage capacity of the organic layer compared to the mineral soils suggests that most nutrient and water uptake occurs in this layer. However, hydraulic properties of mineral soils and their impact on hydrology of TMCFs have been poorly studied. Here we provide organic layer water retention curves for TMCF soils that were measured in the laboratory. With these data we assessed the potential land-use and climate change impacts on TMCF soil moisture dynamics. From the land-use change perspective, we estimated the water storage capacity loss by slash-and-burn deforestation practices. These estimates show that the storage loss ranges from 35 to 59 mm when TMCFs are converted to pastures. This is several times higher than the estimated TMCF canopy storage capacity (2 to 5 mm). Therefore, the higher peak flow observations in deforested catchments might not only be explained by a decreasing canopy water storage but also likely due to a decreasing soil water storage. From the climate change perspective, we evaluated the effect of contrasting dry season conditions on soil moisture and transpiration using a 1-D water-flow model, and assessed the sensitivity of these hydrological variables to uncertainties in saturated hydraulic conductivity. Although transpiration was not limited by soil moisture during the mild dry season, it was affected during the severe dry season and continued to decline under expected climate change with the prolongation of dry spells. Our results show that the organic layer is a key element in TMCF's hydrological functioning and call for an increased focus on the role of organic soils when evaluating effects of land-use change.

"System identification of structures is one of the important aspects of structural health monitoring. The accuracy and efficiency of identification results is affected severely by measurement noises, especially when the structure system is large, such as bridge structures, and when online system identification is required. In this paper, the least square estimation (LSE) method is used combined with the substructure approach for identifying structural parameters of a cable-stay bridge with large degree of freedoms online. Numerical analysis is carried out by first dividing the bridge structure into smaller substructures and then estimates the parameters of each substructure online using LSE method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of identifying structural parameters, however, the accuracy and efficiency of identification results depend highly on the noise sensitivities of loading region, loading pattern as well as element size.",49
"Aging is a cause of cognitive decline in the elderly and the major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, however, aging people are not all destined to develop into cognitive deficits, the molecular mechanisms underlying this difference in cognition of aging people are obscure. Epigenetic modifications, particularly histone acetylation in the nervous system, play a critical role in regulation of gene expression for learning and memory. An inhibitor of acetyltransferases (INHAT) is reported to suppress histone acetylation via a histone-masking mechanism, and pp32 is a key component of INHAT complex. In the present study, we divided 18 m-old aged mice into the cognitive-normal and the cognitive-impaired group by Morris water maze, and found that pp32 level was significantly increased in the hippocampus of cognitive-impaired aged mice. The mRNA and protein levels of synaptic-associated proteins decreased with reduced dendrite complexity and histone acetylation. Knockdown of pp32 rescued cognitive decline in cognitive-impaired aged mice with restoration of synaptic-associated proteins, the increase of spine density and elevation of histone acetylation. Our study reveals a novel mechanism underlying the aging-associated cognitive disturbance, indicating that suppression of pp32 might represent a promising therapeutic approach for learning and memory impairments.",106
"Cultures of honor, such as Turkey, prioritize defending individual and family reputations, but in gender-specific ways (Nisbett and Cohen 1996). Men maintain honor via reputations for toughness, aggression, control over women, and avenging insults. Women maintain honor through obedience to men, sexual modesty, and religious piety. Honor beliefs support women's subordination, justifying violence against them (Sev'er and Yurdakul, Violence against Women, 7, 964-998, 2001) and therefore should be challenged. Understanding honor beliefs' ideological correlates may inform such efforts. We hypothesized that benevolent sexism, a subjectively favorable system-justifying ideology, would more strongly, positively predict Turkish women's (versus men's) honor beliefs; whereas hostile sexism, which is openly antagonistic toward women, would more strongly, positively predict Turkish men's (versus women's) honor beliefs. Additionally, due to justifications for gender inequality embedded in Islamic religious teachings, we expected Islamic religiosity to positively predict honor beliefs for both genders. A convenience sample of Turkish undergraduates (313 women and 122 men) in Ankara completed the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory, Religious Orientation Scale, and Honor Endorsement Index. Regression analyses revealed that benevolent (but not hostile) sexism positively predicted women's honor beliefs, whereas hostile (but not benevolent) sexism positively predicted men's honor beliefs. Islamic religiosity positively predicted honor beliefs for both genders, but (unexpectedly) did so more strongly for men than women. We suggest that combating benevolent sexism and promoting feminist interpretations of Islamic religiosity may help to empower Turkish women to challenge honor beliefs.",61
"The servo velocity sensors (SVS) provide the reliable and accurate velocity and acceleration measurements of the civil infrastructures, such as bridges and buildings. However, most SVSs communicate with the data processing unit through wired cable and this impedes the on-time and continuous monitoring applications using SVS. In this study, a mote-integrated converter module is designed and implemented to bridge SVS and wireless sensor networks (WSN). The proposed WSN-enabled SVS is verified by comparing measured results with those from the purchased commercial system in a bridge scour experiment, applied to a corridor bridge vibration measurement, and employed in a suspension bridge vibration test. Several guidelines of the deployment and installation of this WSN-enabled SVS in a vibration monitoring application are carefully addressed and suggested. With optimized deployment scheme which reduce the packet loss efficiently, this WSN-enabled SVS can be applied to continuous monitoring applications definitely.",97
"Manufacturing cost analysis is becoming an increasingly important tool in the photovoltaics industry to identify research areas that need attention and enable progress towards cost reduction targets. We describe a method to estimate manufacturing cost that is suitable for use during an early stage of technology development, delivering both the manufacturing cost estimate as well as an uncertainty analysis that quickly highlights the opportunities for greatest cost improvement. We apply the technique to three process sequences for the large-scale production of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite photovoltaic modules. A process sequence that combines two demonstrated perovskite module sequences is estimated to cost $107/m(2) (uncertainty range $87 to 140/m(2)), comparable with commercial crystalline silicon and cadmium telluride technologies (on a US $/m(2) basis). A levelized cost of electricity calculation shows that this perovskite technology would be competitive in 2015 with incumbent photovoltaic technologies if a module power conversion efficiency of 18% and lifetime of 20 years can be achieved. Further analysis shows that even if the cost of the active layers and rear electrode were reduced to zero, a module power conversion efficiency of 18% and lifetime of 20 years would be required to meet the 2020 SunShot levelized cost of electricity targets.

"Developing water-saving cultivation techniques is necessary to relieve the pressure of water demand under irrigation regions in dry semi-humid areas of China. Ridge-furrow with plastic film mulching (RFPFM), as a prospective rainwater harvesting system, has been widely adopted in rain-fed arid and semi-arid regions in northern China. However, it is unclear if RFPFM can be applied to wheat-maize double-cropping systems to increase the summer-maize yield and water use efficiency (WUE) in dry semi-humid areas to reduce the use of irrigation water. Three cultivation practices (traditional flat planting (CM), RFPFM and well irrigation planting (WI)) in combination with two nitrogen (N) rates (75 and 225 kg N ha(-1)) and two cultivars were conducted to certify the potential role of RFPFM in increasing summer-maize yields, WUE, and N fertilizer use efficiency based on the double-cropping system. The results showed that the RFPFM practice hastened maize seeding emergence by 2 days and extended grain filling duration by 3-4 days in comparison with the CM practice. Aboveground biomass and N accumulation of maize plant were significantly higher under RFPFM and WI practices than the CM practice. The maize yield of RFPFM was similar to that of WI practice, and both practices increased the number of kernels per ear, 1000-kernel weight and grain yield compared to the CM practice. The RFPFM practice increased WUE by 29.2% and 70.5%, compared to the CM and WI practices, respectively, for the summer-maize season, averaged across two years. In addition, RFPFM practice significantly increased N fertilizer productivity and N uptake efficiency by 33.4% and 44.7%, respectively, in comparison with CM, averaged across other treatments and two years. The present study illustrates that the RFPFM practice could maintain the high summer maize productivity under wheat-maize double-cropping systems in dry semi-humid areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"Sleep disorders are among the most common clinical problems and possess a significant concern for the geriatric population. More importantly, while around 40% of elderly adults have sleep-related complaints, sleep disorders are more frequently associated with co-morbidities including age-related neurodegenerative diseases and mild cognitive impairment. Recently, increasing evidence has indicated that disturbed sleep may not only serve as the consequence of brain atrophy, but also contribute to the pathogenesis of dementia and, therefore, significantly increase dementia risk. Since the current therapeutic interventions lack efficacies to prevent, delay or reverse the pathological progress of dementia, a better understanding of underlying mechanisms by which sleep disorders interact with the pathogenesis of dementia will provide possible targets for the prevention and treatment of dementia. In this review, we briefly describe the physiological roles of sleep in learning/memory, and specifically update the recent research evidence demonstrating the association between sleep disorders and dementia. Plausible mechanisms are further discussed. Moreover, we also evaluate the possibility of sleep therapy as a potential intervention for dementia.",106
"This paper presents a small-size electric power sensor that can be installed at an outlet to sense the power of electrical appliances whose plugs are inserted into the outlet. The data for the power consumption of the appliance and the power for the microcontroller unit (MCU) are obtained by an electromagnetic induction method, so that it can be implemented without any electrical work. The sensitivity of the power sensor is 1 W, and the power for the MCU can be generated from an appliance power of 23 W. The sensor itself consumes 3.75 mW. This sensor can be used to measure the power consumption of the existing electrical appliances.",51
"Hereditary angioedema (HAE) caused by a deficiency of functional C1-inhibitor (C1INH) becomes clinically manifest as attacks of angioedema. C1INH is the main inhibitor of the contact system. Poor control of a local activation process of this system at the site of the attack is believed to lead to the formation of bradykinin (BK), which increases local vasopermeability and mediates angioedema on interaction with BK receptor 2 on the endothelium. However, several observations in patients with HAE are difficult to explain from a pathogenic model claiming a local activation process at the site of the angioedema attack. Therefore we postulate an alternative model for angioedema attacks in patients with HAE, which assumes a systemic, fluid-phase activation of the contact system to generate BK and its breakdown products. Interaction of these peptides with endothelial receptors that are locally expressed in the affected tissues rather than with receptors constitutively expressed by the endothelium throughout the whole body explains that such a systemic activation process results in local manifestations of an attack. In particular, BK receptor 1, which is induced on the endothelium by inflammatory stimuli, such as kinins and cytokines, meets the specifications of the involved receptor. The pathogenic model discussed here also provides an explanation for why angioedema can occur at multiple sites during an attack and why HAE attacks respond well to modest increases of circulating C1INH activity levels because inhibition of fluid-phase Factor XIIa and kallikrein requires lower C1INH levels than inhibition of activator-bound factors.",131
"Background & Aims. Considering the ability of anti-TNF alpha drugs to lower the burden intestinal inflammation in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and the similarity between IBD and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) regarding inflammatory intestinal involvement, we aimed to investigate the impact of anti- TNF alpha biologic therapy on subclinical intestinal inflammation in AS patients. Methods. Between January 2008 and December 2013, 38 AS patients and 23 controls were enrolled in the study and investigated with small bowel videocapsule endoscopy examination and ileocolonoscopy. Each tertile of the small bowel (proximal, mid and distal) was assessed by calculating the Lewis score based on the image stream. Results. The Lewis scores were significantly higher in the AS group compared to controls (580.9 +/- 818 vs. 81 +/- 121, p<0.001). 16 patients (42.1%) were on anti- TNF alpha therapy (Adalimumab (n = 5), Infliximab (n = 5) or Etanercept (n = 6)). 31.3% of them used NSAIDs simultaneously, compared with 77.3% of the other patients (p< 0.01). Their Lewis scores were lower compared to the other patients for the entire small bowel (306 +/- 164 vs. 790 +/- 1038, p = 0.015), its proximal and distal tertiles (238 +/- 154 vs. 560 +/- 543, p = 0.021, and 140 +/- 189 vs. 300 +/- 220, p = 0.027, respectively). The Lewis score was also lower in patients receiving Adalimumab/ Infliximab compared to those on Etanercept for the entire bowel and its distal tertile (262 +/- 165 vs. 380 +/- 148, p = 0.069 and 62 +/- 101 vs. 273 +/- 236, p = 0.060, respectively). Conclusion. Anti-TNF alpha therapy in patients with AS reduces the subclinical intestinal inflammation, but the magnitude seems to depend upon the class anti-TNF alpha agent used (Clinical Trials. gov NCT00768950).",107
"This paper deals with generalization of the Brayton-Moser network decomposition and related structural properties to a relatively large class of finite dimensional strictly causal systems, which can be described in the state-space representation form. The resulting energy-metric function is defined for dissipative systems and is induced by the output signal dissipation power. It is demonstrated that such a power-oriented approach determines both, the structure of a system representation as well as the corresponding system state space topology. A special form of physically correct internal structure of an equivalent state space representation has been derived as a natural consequence of strict causality, the state-space energy conservation, dissipativity assumption and the state minimality requirement.",58
"In this study, BiVO4 was prepared by a hydrothermal synthesis route in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate using aqueous NH3 as precipitant. g-C3N4 was prepared by a combustion method using melamine. In order to develop highly efficient photocatalyst, a heterojunction catalyst based on g-C3N4 and BiVO4 was prepared. Different amounts of BiVO4 and g-C3N4 were mixed and annealed to obtain heterojunction photocatalysts. FeVO4 and LaVO4 were also prepared for the comparative catalytic investigation. Catalysts were characterized by a series of complementary combinations of powder X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, elemental analysis, N-2 adsorption-desorption, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 and CO2, diffuse reflectance ultraviolet visible spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and photoelectrochemical studies. Catalysts were investigated in the visible light driven oxidation of benzyl alcohol, benzyl amine, and aniline with O-2. In order to propose the electrons, holes, and radicals mediated reaction pathways, reactions were performed in the presence of an electron/hole/radical scavenger. Further, in order to confirm various products formed during the photocatalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol, benzyl amine, and aniline, several model reactions were carried out. Based on the results obtained, the reaction mechanism and structure activity relationship were established.",100
"Purpose - Implementing health promotion programmes in schools is key to improving children's health and well-being but difficulties in achieving expected results are often reported in the research literature. Discrepancies between expected and achieved outcomes can originate from differences in contexts. Understanding how interactions between contexts and programmes generate variable outcomes is, therefore, critical. The purpose of this paper is to explore the outputs of a programme implemented in different school contexts. The focus is to pinpoint outputs, understand the involvement of combinations of contextual factors and identify recurrences in these combinations. Design/methodology/approach - This retrospective study covers a period from 2006 to 2016. Data collection includes two sets of data in eight high schools in the Rhone-Alpes Region in France: written documents and interviews with school staff. Realist evaluation is used to attempt to pinpoint outputs and relating contextual factors. Findings - Results highlight the limited outputs of the programme. Differences between schools appear to originate from existing school policy prior to participation, existence of a project team, identification of the issue as priority and staff turnover. Analysis of contextual factors led to considering the implementation process as enabling health capacity building and enhanced the capacity of settings and communities to promote health. Originality/value - Previous research suggests that top-down implementation of a standard programme is not an efficient strategy for all schools to engage in the development of suitable health promotion policies. A potential way forward is to base support for the local development of health promotion in schools on a better understanding of the contexts in which implementation occurs.",117
"Objective: This study moves beyond previous cohort studies and benchmark data by studying a population of elective spine surgery from a multicenter registry in an effort to validate, disprove, and/or identify novel risk factors for dural tears. Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis queried a multicenter registry for patients with degenerative spinal diagnoses undergoing elective spinal surgery from 2010-2014. Multivariable logistic regression analysis interrogated for independent risk factors of dural tears. Results: Of 104,930 patients, a dural tear requiring repair occurred in 0.6% of cases. On adjusted analysis, the following factors were independently associated with increased likelihood of a dural tear: ankylosing spondylitis vs. intervertebral disc disorders, greater than two levels, combined surgical approach and posterior approach vs. anterior approach, decompression only vs. fusion and decompression, age groups 85+, 75-84 and 65-74 vs.= 30), corticosteroid use and preoperative platelet count <150,000. Conclusions: This multicenter study identifies novel risk factors for dural tears in the elective spine surgery population, including corticosteroids, thrombocytopenia, and ankylosing spondylitis. The results of this analysis provide further information for surgeons to use both in operative planning and in preoperative counseling when discussing the risk of dural tears.",107
"Clinical delineation between epilepsy and migraine as the cause of visual auras may be difficult in many cases and lead to misdiagnosis.

"Schizotypy is a term that refers to a continuum of personality characteristics, emerging from mental states ranging from organized and normal to unorganized and disordered; with the latter tending to include individuals with high schizotypal scores as well as those diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder. Evidence from psychophysiological studies has found a relative weakness in the inhibitory functioning, including prepulse inhibition (PPI), sensory gating (SG), and antisaccade eye movement (AEM) in schizotypy and schizophrenia. As schizotypy and schizophrenia are in the same spectrum, understanding the nature of sensory and motor inhibitory weakness associated with schizotypy will optimize the prevention and intervention for both schizotypy and schizophrenia populations. This review aims at examining the deficits of sensory gating, saccade control, and prepulse inhibition in schizotypy; examining the relationship between the three measures and schizotypal symptoms and traits; examining the effect of nicotine on the three measures; and examining the relevant brain regions to the three measures. We searched multiple databases (such as MEDLINE, Pubmed, PsychINFO, Google Scholar) using combinations of the keywords: schizotypy, schizotypal personality disorder, prepulse inhibition, sensory gating and antisaccade for articles published in English since 1980. We found that three measures (SG, PPI and AEM) are associated with major schizotypal symptoms, suggesting that three measures could be used to predict the disease etiology and prognosis. Secondly, the three measures are modulated by nicotine administration at a certain level, providing a potential tool to study the role of nicotine in the cognition and symptom improvement in schizotypy. Thirdly, brain-imaging studies have localized activity in brain regions associated with sensory gating, saccade control, and prepulse inhibition, narrowing the search for brain regions to target for the treatment and prevention of schizotypy. Overall, the three measures are suggested to be a valuable tool to study the inhibitory deficits in schizotypy, and maybe used as a tool for the prevention and treatment of schizotypy as well.

"Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer an unlimited resource of cells to be used for the study of underlying molecular biology of disease, therapeutic drug screening, and transplant-based regenerative medicine. However, methods for the directed differentiation of skeletal muscle for these purposes remain scarce and incomplete. Here, we present a novel, small molecule-based protocol for the generation of multinucleated skeletal myotubes using eight independent iPSC lines. Through combinatorial inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 beta) with addition of bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), we report up to 64% conversion of iPSCs into the myogenic program by day 36 as indicated by MYOG(+) cell populations. These cells began to exhibit spontaneous contractions as early as 34 days in vitro in the presence of a serum-free medium formulation. We used this protocol to obtain iPSC-derived muscle cells from frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients harboring C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansions (rGGGGCC), sporadic FTD, and unaffected controls. iPSCs derived from rGGGGCC carriers contained RNA foci but did not vary in differentiation efficiency when compared to unaffected controls nor display mislocalized TDP-43 after as many as 120 days in vitro. This study presents a rapid, efficient, and transgene-free method for generating multinucleated skeletal myotubes from iPSCs and a resource for further modeling the role of skeletal muscle in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other motor neuron diseases.",30
"Introduction: Cow's milk allergy is the most common food allergy in children. Symptoms usually involve the skin and the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. Gastrointestinal tract manifestations of cow's milk allergy are nonspecific, and are the only type that can be diagnosed in all age groups. Here, we report a rare case of cow's milk allergy in an infant with hypoalbuminemia and malnutrition. Case Presentation: A nine-month-old girl was admitted to Dr. Sami Ulus maternity and children's health and diseases training and research hospital, Ankara, Turkey, in September 2013, for weakness and swelling of the legs that had endured for two days. She had bilateral pretibial pitting (+2) edema. Laboratory data revealed albumin at 1.7 g/dL; serum Na, K, urea, creatinin, and alanine-aspartate aminotransferase levels were normal. Her urinary analysis did not reveal proteinuria. Stool samples were normal, and stool steatocrite was negative. Anti-gliadin, anti-endomysium, and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies were negative. Cow's milk allergy was diagnosed due to cow's milk-specific IgE and skin prick test results. Conclusions: On rare occasions, cow's milk allergy presents with hypoalbuminemia. When diagnosis is delayed, this allergy may impair the growth and quality of life and may even be life-threatening.",117
"Signaling pathways driven by protein and lipid kinases are altered in most human diseases. Therefore, pharmacological inhibitors of cell signaling are one of the most intensively pursued therapeutic approaches for the treatment of diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration, and metabolic syndromes. Phosphoproteomics is a technique that measures the products of kinase activities and, with the appropriate bioinformatics techniques, the methodology can also provide measures of kinase pathway activation and network circuitry. Hence, due to recent technological advantages, LC-MS-based quantitative phosphoproteomics provides relevant information for the design and implementation of kinase inhibitor based therapies. Here, we review how phosphoproteome profiling is being used in translational research as a means to identify drug targets and biomarkers for personalizing therapies based on kinase inhibitors.",42
"The study aimed to polish wastewater effluent from an activated treatment system for nitrogen removal by a packed bed bioreactor (PBR). The nitrogen removal via simultaneous partial nitrification, anammox and denitrification (SNAD) process was investigated with different hydraulic retention times (HRTs). The results show that both effluent ammonia-and nitrate-nitrogen concentrations approached to 0 mg/L at the HRT as low as 3 h. The total nitrogen removal efficiency decreased from an average of 84% at both 18- and 24-h HRTs to 38% at 3-h HRT. This low nitrogen removal efficiency was due to the presence of incomplete degradation of organic nitrogen at shorter HRTs. The analysis using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction resolves that the ratio of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) to the domain Eubacteria changed limited in the range between 2.8 and 4.0% during the continuous operation. Meanwhile, the nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) increased from 0.0 to 2.9% when the HRT was gradually reduced to 3 h. The anammox bacteria accounting for 30.5% of microbial consortia dominated the AOB and the NOB at the 3-h HRT. In sum, inorganic form of nitrogen in a typical wastewater plant effluent could be efficiently polished via SNAD process in the PBR. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",37
"One important research area in autonomous mobile robotics is to create companions that live in our ambience and perform tasks to help in everyday life. On the other hand, Ambient Intelligence (AmI) seeks to create a network of helpful intelligent devices. This paper describes an approach for the development of cooperation models for eldercare robot teams using goal-driven control components. The framework and the approach are illustrated through the development and assessment of task allocation in multi-robot teams. Two cooperation models are implemented: (i) a team model based on the adaptive multi-agent systems theory where task responsibility is agreed among team peers by exchanging individual estimations of the degree of difficulty and priority to achieve the task; (ii) a hierarchical model where a robot manager asks for the estimations of its team members and then assigns the task. Experimentation for team cooperation assessment is performed through considering environmental changes, as well as communications and internal failures. The proposal is simulated in an AmI-oriented elderly care center to assist seniors in need.",92
"When managers are implementing change, practitioners are sometimes seen as the receivers of the change. However, practitioners often need to actively create the changes to daily practices because managers might not be familiar with the practices. Building information modelling (BIM), an important driver of organizational change, requires change not only by bringing new technology into use but also to the practices of collaboration between different professions. In their daily work, practitioners can create new practices through reflective learning. We have a limited understanding of how practitioners are actively involved in a change through reflective learning when implementing BIM. To address this limitation, we conducted a qualitative case study. Our primary data consist of interviews, which were analysed with insights from philosophy. We identified two methods of reflective learning from the data: deconstruction and reconstruction. Deconstruction occurs when the new requirements for the practices are based on different ideas of work, which asks practitioners to change their old ideas before creating new practices. Reconstruction does not necessarily require changes to the basic ideas of work but changes are seen more as improvements. Our research contributes to construction management literature by linking the reflective learning of practitioners to the change caused by BIM.",102
"This paper presents a technique to recognize the power quality (PQ) disturbances associated with solar energy penetration in distribution network. The voltage signal is analysed with the help of Stockwell's transform (S-transform) then its features are utilized to recognize power quality events with the help of Fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM). The operations considered for PQ assessment include grid synchronization and outage of solar photovoltaic (PV) system. The PQ events associated with sudden change in solar insolation have also been investigated. The proposed study is carried out using a standard IEEE-13 bus test system modified by incorporating the solar PV system. The effect of increase in solar energy penetration in terms of power quality assessment has also been investigated with solar PV systems of capacities 100 kW, 500 kW and 1 MW using the proposed power quality index, maximum deviations in frequency and total harmonics distortions of voltage and current. The study has been carried out using MATLAB/Simulink and simulation results are compared with the real time results obtained using real time digital simulator (RTDS) for validating the effectiveness of proposed study.

"Magnetic force spectroscopy is a rapidly developing single molecule technique that has found numerous applications at the interface of physics and biology. Since the invention of the first magnetic tweezers, a number of modifications to the approach have helped to relieve the limitations of the original design while amplifying its strengths. Inventive molecular biology solutions further advanced the technique by expanding its possible applications. In its present form, the method can be applied to both single molecules and live cells without resorting to intense irradiation, can be easily multiplexed, accommodates multiple DNAs, displays impressive resolution, and allows a remarkable ease in the stretching and twisting of macromolecules. In this review, we describe the architecture of magnetic tweezers, key requirements for experimental design and analysis of data, and outline several applications of the method that illustrate its versatility.",30
"This paper studies the existence of synergisms between some degradation agents of geotextiles. For that purpose, a polypropylene geotextile (stabilised with Chimassorb 944) was exposed to some degradation tests: immersion in liquids (water, sulphuric and nitric acids, sodium hydroxide and metallic ion solutions), thermo-oxidation and artificial weathering. The geotextile was (1) exposed individually to each degradation agent (single exposure) and (2) exposed successively to some combinations of two agents (multiple exposures). Results showed that, in some cases, the combined action of two degradation agents was more damaging than the sum of the individual effects of each agent. The most relevant examples of this included: (1) immersion in sodium hydroxide and thermo-oxidation, (2) immersion in iron nitrate and thermo-oxidation and (3) immersion in cadmium or copper nitrate and artificial weathering.

"Osteoporosis and hypertension are two widespread diseases, which share many of the same risk factors such as advanced age, early menopause, smoking, and physical inactivity. The aim of this study is to examine the association between fragility fractures, anti-hypertensive drugs (subgroup C02, according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system [ATC]), diuretics (subgroup C03), b-blocker (subgroup C07), calcium antagonist (subgroup C08) and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system regulator (subC09), and drugs administration for osteoporosis among the osteoporotic population of a region of Southern Italy. We retrospectively studied Hospital Discharge Data (HDD) in the Apulian database for the period 2006-2010 to find fragility fractures treated with hospitalization in men aged over 65 years and in women aged over 50 years. We then checked the database for drug prescriptions to identify those patients who had taken at least one osteoporosis drug. Within this latter group, based on hospital admissions and prescription records, we identified the patients affected with hypertension. We observed that, between 2006 and 2010, in Apulia, 177,639 patients were hospitalized and diagnosed as having fragility fractures. The prevalence of hypertension patients in Apulia in this period was estimated at 44.3%. In the same region and period, the prevalence of patients with fragility fracture, who also had hypertension, was 80.9%. The percentage of fracture was lowest in the female population aged 50-59 years (52.5%), while the highest was in women aged >80 years (92.5%). We observed that in hypertensive patients the most frequent site of fracture was the femur (43,638 cases), while the least frequent were the tarsus and metatarsus (742 cases combined). The patients who took angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and diuretic drugs presented a higher number of fragility fractures, while the calcium antagonists, beta-blockers, and ATC anti-hypertensive drugs were linked to a reduced incidence of lesions. Hypertension is associated with increased fracture risk in the Apulia population. The bone demineralization effect of this disease should be taken into account during the management of these patients. The different distribution of fragility fractures in relation to anti-hypertensive treatment warrants further investigation.",9
"As a result of severe environmental pressure and stringent government regulations, refined energy management for vehicles has become inevitable. To improve vehicle fuel economy, this paper presents a bus-based energy management system for the electrical system of internal combustion engine vehicles. Both the model of an intelligent alternator and the model of a lead-acid battery are discussed. According to these models, the energy management for a vehicular electrical system is formulated as a global optimal control problem which aims to minimize fuel consumption. Pontryagin's minimum principle is applied to solve the optimal control problem to realize a real-time control strategy for electrical energy management in vehicles. The control strategy can change the output of the intelligent alternator and the battery with the changes of electrical load and driving conditions in real-time. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the traditional open-loop control strategy, the proposed control strategy for vehicle energy management can effectively reduce fuel consumption and the fuel consumption per 100 km is decreased by approximately 1.7%.",87
"Purpose of review Emergency contraception provides a critical and time-sensitive opportunity for women to prevent undesired pregnancy after intercourse. Both access and available options for emergency contraception have changed over the last several years. Recent findings Emergency contraceptive pills can be less effective in obese women. The maximum achieved serum concentration of levonorgestrel (LNG) is lower in obese women than women of normal BMI, and doubling the dose of LNG (3 mg) increases its concentration maximum, approximating the level in normal BMI women receiving one dose of LNG. Repeated use of both LNG and ulipristal acetate (UPA) is well tolerated. Hormonal contraception can be immediately started following LNG use, but should be delayed for 5 days after UPA use to avoid dampening the efficacy of UPA. The copper intrauterine device (IUD) is the only IUD approved for emergency contraception (and the most effective method of emergency contraception), but use of LNG IUD as emergency contraception is currently being investigated. Accurate knowledge about emergency contraception remains low both for patients and healthcare providers. Summary Emergency contraception is an important yet underutilized tool available to women to prevent pregnancy. Current options including copper IUD and emergency contraceptive pills are safe and well tolerated. Significant gaps in knowledge of emergency contraception on both the provider and user level exist, as do barriers to expedient access of emergency contraception.",124
"A novel material for the electrochemical determination of endocrine disruptors using a composite based on graphene oxide modified with cadmium telluride quantum dots has been evaluated. The morphology, structure and electrochemical performance of the composite electrodes were characterised by transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, UV-visible absorption spectra, fluorescence spectra, Raman spectra and cyclic voltammetry. The dynamic light scattering, transmission electronic microscopy and spectrophotometric measurements all showed good distribution of the quantum dots with a small particle size. The electrochemical measurements demonstrated the high performance of the composite response in the presence of a light source. Differential pulse voltammetry allowed the development of a method to determine 17-estradiol levels in the range from 0.2 to 4.0molL(-1) with a detection limit of 2.8nmolL(-1) (0.76gL(-1)).",103
"Background: Psychosocial distress is common among cancer patients. Significant associations between coping and social support with distress and quality of life in adult cancer patients have been identified before, but little is known about the interrelationships between distress, medical coping, and social support in adolescents and young adults (AYAs). Objective: The aims of this study are to investigate the prevalence of psychological distress in Chinese AYAs with cancer and examine the associations among distress, anxiety and depression, medical coping, and social support in the same population. Methods: A total of 610 AYA patients were recruited for this study; 551 patients completed the Chinese version of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer (DT), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Medical Coping Modes Questionnaire, and the Social Support Rating Scale. Results: The prevalence of psychological distress was 89.1% in Chinese AYAs with cancer. The DT scores were the highest in the 21-to 25-year-old patients; the DT scores were positively correlated with anxiety and depression (PG. 01) but negatively correlated with medical coping and social support (PG. 01). Conclusion: The prevalence of psychological distress in AYA cancer patients was higher than that in the general cancer population. Medical coping and social support can lower the prevalence of psychological distress in AYA cancer patients. Implications for Practice: Findings suggest the need for evidence-based intervention strategies to enhance medical coping and social support in AYA cancer patients. Nurses are crucial to implementing psychological interventions in AYA cancer patients.",69
"This study examines rates of co-morbid mental disorders and indicators of the course of illness among individuals with bipolar disorder and cannabis use disorders (CUD). Data were drawn from the National Epidemiological Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC Wave 1. 2001-2002), a nationally representative sample of adults living in the United States. Among individuals with lifetime prevalence of bipolar disorder (N=1905) rates of CUD in the past 12 months were 7.2%, compared to 1.2% in the general population. Logistic regression models adjusting for sociodemographic variables indicated that individuals with bipolar disorder and co-occurring CUD were at increased risk for nicotine dependence (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR)=3.8), alcohol (AOR=6.6) and drug (AOR=11.9) use disorders, as well as antisocial personality disorder (AOR=2.8) compared to those without CUD. Among individuals with co-occurring CUD, age of onset of bipolar disorder was significantly lower and median number of manic, hypomanic and depressive episodes per year was significantly greater compared to individuals without CUD. Co-occurring CUD is associated with significant co-morbidities and a more severe course of illness among individuals with bipolar disorder. Comprehensive evaluation of patients with bipolar disorder should include a systematic assessment of CUD. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",73
"Mass-spectrometry-based proteomics is continuing to make major contributions to the discovery of fundamental biological processes and, more recently, has also developed into an assay platform capable of measuring hundreds to thousands of proteins in any biological system. The field has progressed at an amazing rate over the past five years in terms of technology as well as the breadth and depth of applications in all areas of the life sciences. Some of the technical approaches that were at an experimental stage back then are considered the gold standard today, and the community is learning to come to grips with the volume and complexity of the data generated. The revolution in DNA/RNA sequencing technology extends the reach of proteomic research to practically any species, and the notion that mass spectrometry has the potential to eventually retire the western blot is no longer in the realm of science fiction. In this review, we focus on the major technical and conceptual developments since 2007 and illustrate these by important recent applications.",31
"The combined supplementation of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), L-leucine-rich amino acids, and cholecalciferol (vitamin D-3) increase muscle strength and function in frail elderly individuals. However, their effects on cognition are unknown. We enrolled 38 elderly nursing home residents (mean age +/- SD, 86.6 +/- 4.8 y) in a 3-mo randomized, controlled, parallel group trial. The participants were randomly allocated to 3 groups: the first group received a L-leucine (1.2 g)- and cholecalciferol (20 mu g)-enriched supplement with 6 g of MCT (LD+MCT); the second group received the same supplement with 6 g of long-chain triglycerides (LD+LCT); and the third group did not receive any supplements (control). Cognition was assessed at baseline and after the 3-mo intervention. The difference in changes among the groups was assessed with ANCOVA, adjusting for age and the baseline value as covariates. After 3 mo, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score in the LD+MCT group increased by 10.6% (from 16.6 to 18.4 points, p<0.05). After 3 mo, the Nishimura geriatric rating scale for mental status (NM scale) score in the LD+MCT group increased by 30.6% (from 24.6 to 32.2 points, p<0.001), whereas that in the LD+LCT and control groups decreased by 11.2% (from 31.2 to 27.7 points, p<0.05) and 26.1% (from 27.2 to 20.1 points, p<0.001), respectively. The combined supplementation of MCTs (6 g), L-leucine-rich amino acids, and cholecalciferol may improve cognitive function in frail elderly individuals.",106
"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized by cartilage degradation and inflammation. Fisetin, a polyphenol extracted from fruits and vegetables, has been reported to have anti-inflammatory effects. Our study aimed to investigate the effect of fisetin on OA both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, chondrocytes were pretreated with fisetin alone or fisetin combined with sirtinol (an inhibitor of SIRT1) for 2 h before IL-1 beta stimulation. Production of NO, PGE2, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 were evaluated by the Griess reaction and ELISAs. The mRNA (COX-2, iNOS, MMP-3, MMP-13, ADAMTS-5, Sox-9, aggrecan and collagen-II) and protein expression (COX-2, iNOS, MMP-3, MMP-13, ADAMTS-5 and SIRT1) were measured by qRT-PCR and Western blot respectively. Immunofluorescence was used to assess the expression of collagen-II and SIRT1. SIRT1 activity was quantified with SIRT1 fluorometric assay kit. The in vivo effect of fisetin was evaluated by gavage in mice OA models induced by destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM). We found that fisetin inhibited IL-1 beta-induced expression of NO, PGE2, TNF-a, IL-6, COX-2, iNOS, MMP-3, MMP-13, ADAMTS-5. Besides, fisetin remarkably decreased IL-1 beta -induced degradation of Sox-9, aggrecan and collagen-II. Furthermore, fisetin significantly inhibited IL-1 beta -induced SIRT1 decrease andinactivation. However, the inhibitory effect of fisetin was obvious abolished by sirtinol, suggesting that fisetin exerts anti-inflammatory effects through activating SIRT1. In vivo, fisetin-treated mice exhibited less cartilage destruction and lower OARSI scores. Moreover, fisetin reduced subchondral bone plate thickness and alleviated synovitis. Taken together, these findings indicate that fisetin may be a potential agent in the treatment of OA. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",15
"The help of specialist clinicians is often sought to advise staff in residential and nursing care homes about how to work with people with dementia whose behaviour is challenging. The Newcastle Model (James, 2011) is a framework and a process developed to help care staff understand and improve their care of this group. The model emphasises the use of sharing information with staff to develop effective care plans. In the Shared Formulation Sessions characteristic of the Newcastle Model, clinicians take the role of a group facilitator, helping the staff reach a consensus about what needs to change. These sessions can be difficult to manage as intra and inter-group processes emerge and the group express their anxieties. This paper aims to explore the processes that might be in play Shared Formulation Sessions and to suggest ways in which the facilitator might approach this to manage effective collaborative working.",119
"This work addresses the multi-scale modeling of fluid flow in highly complex media based on the concept of Representative Volume Element (RVE). The Method of Multi-scale Virtual Power developed by the authors is employed to construct a coarse scale model from standard fluid flow model at a fine-scale. Kinematic conservation principles, duality arguments and the balance of virtual power between scales are employed to set the grounds of the scale transition of physical fields. This allows to derive in a variationally consistent manner (i) the fine-scale problem to be solved at the RVE, and (ii) the homogenization formulae for coarse-scale dual quantities, namely, the force-like and stress-like fields. Examples of application of flow in permeable media are presented to show the potential of the present approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",86
"Creatine (Cr) is recommended as a dietary supplement especially for athletes but its therapeutic potential is also discussed. It is assumed that human body uses Cr for the formation of phosphocreatine, which is necessary for muscular work as a source of energy. Production of Cr in a body is closely connected to methionine cycle where guanidinoacetate (GAA) is in a final step methylated from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Increased availability of SAM for phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sarcosine synthesis can potentially stimulate endogenous production of betaine a thus methylation of homocysteine (HCy) to form methionine. Our subject who was methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677TT homozygote lowered plasma HCy from 33.3 mu mol/l to 17.1 mu mol/l following one-month Cr supplementation (5 g/day) opposite to 677CC and CT genotypes whose HCy levels tended to increase (but still in normal ranges). We suppose that Cr supplementation stimulates pathways leading to production of sarcosine which can serve to regenerate tetrahydrofolate (THF) to form 5,10-methylene-THF. This could potentially increase MTHFR enzyme activity which may later result in increased HCy methylation. Cr supplementation significantly effects metabolism of one carbon unit and potentially lower body's demands for methyl groups. This could be beneficial as in the case of reduced enzyme activity such as MTHFR 677C/T polymorphism.",32
"In recent years, transportation electrification has emerged as a trend to support energy efficiency and CO2 emissions reduction targets. The true success, however, of this trend depends on the successful integration of electric transportation modes into the infrastructure systems that support them. Left unmanaged, plug-in electric vehicles may suffer from delays due to charging or cause destabilizing charging loads on the electrical grid. Online electric vehicles have emerged to remediate the need for stationary charging and its effects. While many works have sought to mitigate these effects with advanced control functionality, such as coordinated charging, vehicle-to-grid stabilization, and charging queue management, few works have assessed these impacts as a holistic transportation-electricity nexus. This paper develops a hybrid dynamic system model for transportation electrification. It also includes next generation traffic simulation concepts of multimodality and multiagency. Such a model can be used by electrified transportation fleet operators to not just assess but also improve their operations and control. The hybrid dynamic system model is composed of a marked Petri-net model superimposed on the continuous time kinematic and electrical state evolution. The model is demonstrated on an illustrative example of moderate size and functional heterogeneity.",43
"Background: The prevalence of cutaneous adverse food reactions (CAFRs) in dogs and cats is not precisely known. This imprecision is likely due to the various populations that had been studied. Our objectives were to systematically review the literature to determine the prevalence of CAFRs among dogs and cats with pruritus and skin diseases. Results: We searched two databases for pertinent references on August 18, 2016. Among 490 and 220 articles respectively found in the Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded) and CAB Abstract databases, we selected 22 and nine articles that reported data usable for CAFR prevalence determination in dogs and cats, respectively. The prevalence of CAFR in dogs and cats was found to vary depending upon the type of diagnoses made. Among dogs presented to their veterinarian for any diagnosis, the prevalence was 1 to 2% and among those with skin diseases, it ranged between 0 and 24%. The range of CAFR prevalence was similar in dogs with pruritus (9 to 40%), those with any type of allergic skin disease (8 to 62%) and in dogs diagnosed with atopic dermatitis (9 to 50%). In cats presented to a university hospital, the prevalence of CAFR was less than 1% (0.2%), while it was fairly homogeneous in cats with skin diseases (range: 3 to 6%), but higher in cats with pruritus (12 to 21%) than in cats with allergic skin disease (5 to 13%). Conclusions: Among dogs and cats with pruritus and those suspected of allergic skin disease, the prevalence of CAFR is high enough to justify this syndrome to be ruled-out with a restriction (elimination)-provocation dietary trial. This must especially be considered in companion animals with nonseasonal pruritus or signs of allergic dermatitis.",110

"The raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) has a wide distribution in Europe and is a prominent example of a highly adaptable alien species. It has been recorded sporadically in Denmark since 1980 but observations since 2008 suggested that the species had established a free-ranging, self-sustaining population. To elucidate the origin and genetic patterns of Danish raccoon dogs, we studied the population genomics of 190 individuals collected in Denmark (n = 141) together with reference captive individuals from Poland (n = 21) and feral individuals from different European localities (Germany, Poland, Estonia and Finland, n = 28). We used a novel genotyping-by-sequencing approach simultaneously identifying and genotyping a large panel of single nucleotide polymorphisms (n = 4526). Overall, there was significant indication for contemporary genetic structuring of the analysed raccoon dog populations, into at least four different clusters, in spite of the existence of long distance gene flow and secondary admixture from different population sources. The Danish population was characterized by a high level of genetic admixture with neighbouring feral European ancestries and the presence of private clusters, non-retrieved in any other feral or captive populations sampled. These results suggested that the raccoon dog population in Denmark was founded by escapees from genetically unidentified Danish captive stocks, followed by a recent admixture with individuals migrating from neighbouring Germany.",34
"Background: Childhood maltreatment is an important risk factor for mental and physical health problems. Adolescents living in residential youth care (RYC) have experienced a high rate of childhood maltreatment and are a high-risk group for psychiatric disorders. Quality of life (QoL) is a subjective, multidimensional concept that goes beyond medical diagnoses. There is a lack of research regarding the associations between childhood maltreatment and QoL. In the present study, we compare self-reported QoL between adolescents in RYC in Norway with and without maltreatment histories, and adolescents from the general population. We also study the impact of number of types of adversities on QoL. Methods: Adolescents aged 12-23 years living in RYC in Norway were invited to participate in the study; 400 participated, yielding a response rate of 67 %. Maltreatment histories were assessed through interviews with trained research assistants, and completed by 335 adolescents. Previous exposure to maltreatment was reported by 237 adolescents. The Questionnaire for Measuring Health-Related Quality of Life in Children and Adolescents (KINDL-R) was used. Nonexposed peers in RYC (n = 98) and a sample of adolescents from the general population (n = 1017) were used for comparison. General linear model analyses (ANCOVA) were conducted with five KINDL-R life domains as dependent variables. Linear regression was used to study the effect of number of types of adversities. Results: Exposed adolescents in RYC reported poorer QoL than peers in control groups. Compared with nonexposed peers in RYC, the 95 % confidence intervals for mean score differences on the KINDL-R subdomains (0-100 scale) were 1.9-11.4 (Physical Well-being), 2.2-11.1 (Emotional Well-being), -0.7-10.0 (Self-esteem), and 1.8-10.9 (Friends). Compared with the general population sample, the 95 % confidence intervals for mean score differences were 9.7-17.6 (Physical Well-being), 7.9-15.3 (Emotional Well-being), 3.6-12.5 (Self-esteem), and 5.3-12.8 (Friends). Number of types of adversities was associated with a poorer QoL score on all subdomains (Physical-and Emotional Well-being, Self-esteem, Friends, and School). Conclusions: Childhood maltreatment was associated with a poorer QoL score. We suggest the use of QoL and maltreatment measures for all children and adolescents in RYC.",76
"Salvador Dali's relationship with science is one of the most important aspects of his artistic production, spanning disciplines such as physics, mathematics and biology. Considering his interest in the different sciences, the aim of this paper is to explore the special relationship between the painter and molecular biology, establishing a catalogue of works permitting the identification of its importance within Dali's career. We will try to demonstrate that the so-called ""DNA period"" encompasses a broader chronology than the one traditionally proposed, extending it from 1957 until the 1980s. That would place Dali as the pioneer in the incorporation of molecular biology into art history.",30
"An experimental technique based on time-averaged circular geometric moire for optical measurement of angular oscillations is presented in this paper. The pitch of the circular moire is preselected in such a way that angular oscillations of different amplitudes yield time-averaged moire fringes at different locations of the cover image. This optical effect enables to construct an optical scale for direct measurement of angular oscillations. The proposed technique is similar to visual cryptography, which is a cryptographic technique that allows encryption of visual information in such a way, that decryption can be done without use of any computational device. The efficiency and the applicability of the proposed technique for performance degradation prediction of rotating mechanical components is illustrated and validated by computational simulations and experimental tests.",57
"The control of UPS inverters has a special importance in applications where a high quality output voltage is needed. Several control schemes have been proposed for the control of three-phase inverter. This paper presents a simple and powerful control scheme using model predictive control (MPC). It uses a discrete-time model of the system to predict the behaviour of the output voltage for all possible switching states generated by the inverter. Then, a cost function is used for selecting the optimal switching state that will be applied at the next sampling instant. The simulation results under linear and nonlinear loads are presented, using MATLAB/Simulink tools, verifying the feasibility and good performance of the proposed control scheme. Finally, experimental results are presented, using HIL simulation, to verify the feasibility and good performance of the proposed MPC under realistic conditions.",48
"Objective. To review the prenatal development of the maxillary sinus under the perspective of the sinus surgery. Study Design. Cross-sectional study. Setting. Basic embryology laboratory. Subjects and Methods. Morphometry and morphology of the maxillary sinus and its ostium were studied under stereomicroscopy in 100 human fetuses from the 9th to the 37th week. Fetuses were obtained from the Fetal Collection of the School of Medicine of the Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon. Approval was granted by the Ethics Committee. Statistics were applied. Results. The maxillary sinus begins its development at the 10th week. On the 37th week, the anterior-posterior diameter has a mean of 4.36 mm; ossification of the medial wall was absent, and the floor was located below the attachment of the inferior turbinate. Septa and recesses were temporarily observed. Some variations in shape were observed; however, only the oval shape persisted. Maxillary sinus hypoplasia was not found, although asymmetry was present in 30% of cases. The ostium was located at the anterior third of the ethmoid infundibulum; its final dimensions were 1.96 mm in length and 0.44 mm in width. The mean length between the ostium to the lamina papyracea and nasolacrimal duct was 1 mm. One case of double maxillary sinus was observed. Significant difference between the variables, in accordance with the age, was found (P = .02). Conclusion. Knowledge of prenatal development of the maxillary sinus improves the perspective of the sinus surgeon and helps the understanding of postnatal anatomy, especially in children.",75
"Based on phenomenon that both change of stress and temperature will cause elastic volumetric strains, a concept of 'equivalent stress' is introduced into a newly proposed thermoelastoplastic model. This new concept is used to formulate an equivalent subloading yield surface, an extended void ratio difference and the corresponding evolution equation in natural way, which can consider both influences of the stress and temperature. The proposed model can describe properly the general mechanical and thermal behavior of some typical geomaterials and is confirmed by laboratory tests results. For instance, increase of temperature may increase or decrease the strength of materials depending on the characteristics of the materials. Meanwhile, it is proved that the proposed model satisfies thermodynamic theorems in the framework of thermodynamics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",91
"Automotive systems are widely used in industry and our daily life. As the reliability of automotive systems is becoming a greater challenge in our community, increasingly more automotive companies are interested in applying formal methods to improve the reliability of automotive systems. We focus on automotive operating systems conforming to the OSEK/VDX standard. Such operating systems are considered as important components to ensure the reliability of the automotive systems. In previous work, we proposed a framework to verify the design models of reactive systems against their specifications. This framework allows us to check whether the design model conforms to the specification based on a simulation relation. This paper shows a case study in which the framework is applied to a real design of the OSEK/VDX operating system. As a result, we found that we were able to check several important properties of the design model. We show the effectiveness and practicality of the framework based on the results of the case study.",68
"Background Spinal cord stimulation improves microcirculatory blood flow relieves diabetic neuropathic and ischaemic pain and reduces the amputation rate in patients with severe peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Aim: To evaluate whether transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2) measurements can be used as a specific prognostic parameter in the assessment of suitability for permanent device implantation in a prospective controlled study on diabetic patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease. Methods. Sixty patients (39 men, 21 women; mean age: 60 years; range: 46-75) were submitted to implantation of a spinal cord electrical generator for severe peripheral vascular disease, after failed conservative or surgical treatment. The clinical status was classified as Fontaine's stage III and IV and the main pathology was diabetic vascular disease. Pedal TcPO2 was assessed on the dorsum of the foot and ankle and toe pressure Doppler measurements were performed before, two weeks and four weeks after implantation. Results. Pain relief of over 75% and limb salvage were achieved in 35 diabetic patients, while in 12 a partial success with pain relief over 50% and limb salvage for at least 6 months was obtained. In 13 patients the method failed and the affected limbs were amputated. Clinical improvement and spinal cord stimulation success were associated with increases of TcPO2, within the first two weeks after implantation (temporary period). Limb salvage was achieved with significant increase of TcPO2 within the first two weeks of the testing period (from 21.4 to 31.5 mmHg in rest pain patients, p=0.030, from 15.1 to 22.0 mmHg, p=0.030 in patients with trophic lesions under 3 cm(2) in size and in those with trophic lesions over 3 cm(2), from 12.1 to 17.9 mmHg, p=0.025) unrelated to the stage of the disease and the initial TcPO2 value. TcPO2 changes were related to the presence of adequate paraesthesias and warmth in the painful area during the trial period. The systolic anklelbrachial blood pressure Index and toe pressure did not change under stimulation. Conclusions. A two-week testing period should be performed in all diabetic patients treated with spinal cord stimulation for peripheral arterial occlusive disease to identify the candidates for permanent implantation. Only diabetic patients with significant increases of TcPO2 and clinical improvement, during the test period, should be considered for permanent implantation and not merely all patients with pain relief. TcPO2 changes could be used as a predictive index of the therapy success and should be considered in terms of cost effectiveness before the final decision to permanent implantation.",52
"A recent electrophysiological study suggests existing compensatory brain activity as a mechanism for functional recovery of visual attention detection (the capacity for detecting external cues) in symptomatically remitted schizophrenia patients. Despite such evidence, little is known about other aspects of attentional-related processes in schizophrenia during clinical remission, such as their capacity to concentrate on the task at hands without being interfered by distracting information. To this end, we recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) from 20 symptomatically remitted schizophrenia patients and 20 healthy controls while they engaged in a classic Stroop task. Symptomatically remitted patients showed comparable Stroop interference to healthy controls, indicating a degree of functional recovery of such a capacity in these patients. On the neural level, the N450 over the fronto-central and central regions, a component of the ERPs related to conflict detection, was found across both groups, although patients presented a reduced N450 relative to healthy controls. By contrast, the amplitude of the sustained potential (SP) (600-800 ms) over the parieto-central and parietal regions, a component of the ERPs related to conflict resolution, was significantly increased in patients relative to healthy controls. Furthermore, such increased SP amplitude correlated positively with improved behavioral accuracy in symptomatically remitted patients with schizophrenia. These findings reveal that symptomatically remitted patients with schizophrenia increasingly recruited the parietal activity involving successful conflict resolution to offset reduced conflict detection. Therefore, this provides further insight into compensatory mechanisms potentially involving a degree of functional recovery of attentional-related processes in schizophrenia during clinical remission.",115
"Fungal infection is an extremely rare etiology of exit-site and tunnel infection in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). There are few data available regarding its management-especially choice of antifungals, duration of therapy, and removal of catheter. There are no guidelines pertaining to reinsertion of the CAPD catheter following fungal exit-site and tunnel infection. This case report highlights Candida albicans as a rare cause of exit-site and tunnel infection of the CAPD catheter. The catheter was removed and the patient received appropriate antifungal therapy followed by reinsertion of the CAPD catheter and re-initiation on CAPD.",126
"Although cocaine use has been linked to sexual HIV risk behavior for decades, the direct effects of cocaine on sexual desire and sexual decision-making are unexamined. Research suggests delay discounting (devaluation of future outcomes) and probability discounting (devaluation of uncertain outcomes) play roles in condom use decisions. This study examined the effect of cocaine administration on sexual desire, hypothetical condom use, and discounting tasks. This double-blind, within-subjects study compared the effects of 0, 125, and 250 mg/70 kg oral cocaine HCl in 12 cocaine users. Measures included sexual desire and other subjective ratings, the Sexual Delay Discounting Task, the Sexual Probability Discounting Task, and monetary delay and probability discounting tasks. Cocaine caused dose-related increases in sexual desire and prototypical stimulant abuse-liability ratings. Relative to placebo, cocaine did not significantly alter condom use likelihood when condoms were immediately available or when sex was associated with 100% certainty of sexually transmitted infection (STI). In contrast, cocaine dose-dependently strengthened the effect of delay (sexual delay discounting) and STI uncertainty (sexual probability discounting) in decreasing condom use likelihood. Cocaine caused no significant change in monetary delay and probability discounting. This is the first study showing that cocaine administration increases sexual desire. Detrimental effects of cocaine on sexual risk were only observed when safer sex required delay, or STI risk was uncertain (representative of many real-world scenarios), suggesting a critical role of discounting processes. Lack of monetary effects highlights the importance of studying clinically relevant outcomes when examining drug effects on behavioral processes.",132
"When Johann and Daniel Bernoulli founded fluid dynamics they encountered several problems. To go beyond the vision of Newtonian particles, a new set of images was needed in order to deal with the spatial extensibility and lack of form of fluids. I point to evidence that analogy was an essential abductive strategy in the creation of this imagery. But its heuristic behavior is complex: analogy can provide an initial model or proto-model that establishes the starting point of a theoretical process, but it can play other roles as well. The historical genesis analyzed here shows that the participation of analogy in physicists' creativity is not so restricted and that its richness opens up the field for very different roles and strategies in model-based discovery processes. Analogies can crop up intermittently in the evolution of a theory; and they can cooperate with images, extreme case reasoning and thought experiments, and even activate these processes at origin. Although it may seem that the contributions of analogy are generative in the sense of helping to discover new aspects of reality, we must stress the evaluative function that sometimes is performed by analogical reasoning in order to gain confidence. The study of the Bernoulli's genesis of the foundations of fluid dynamics generates interesting hypotheses about the multiple roles that analogy can play in scientific model-based reasoning.",86
"Background and Aim: Limited data are available regarding mortality from inflammatory bowel disease in non-Caucasian populations. Herein, we evaluated overall and cause-specific mortality in a hospital-based cohort of Korean inflammatory bowel disease patients. Methods: We determined mortality in 2414 Crohn's disease patients and 2798 ulcerative colitis patients diagnosed between 1977 and 2013. Standardized mortality ratios were calculated in several demographic and phenotypic subgroups. Results: During the mean 9-year follow up, 114 patients died: 35 with Crohn's disease and 79 with ulcerative colitis. The overall standardized mortality ratios were 1.40 (95% confidence interval: 0.97-1.94) in Crohn's disease and 0.73 (0.58-0.91) in ulcerative colitis. In Crohn's disease, female sex, age10years, ileocolonic disease at diagnosis, perianal fistula, intestinal resection, and ever-use of corticosteroids were associated with higher mortality. In ulcerative colitis, male sex, age >= 30years at diagnosis, disease duration <= 5years, proctitis at diagnosis, and no history of colectomy were associated with lower mortality, while primary sclerosing cholangitis was associated with higher mortality. In both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, high mortality rates due to nonmalignant gastrointestinal causes (standardized mortality ratios: 4.59 and 2.32, respectively) and gastrointestinal malignancies (standardized mortality ratios: 16.59 and 3.45, respectively) were observed. Cardiovascular mortality was lower in ulcerative colitis (standardized mortality ratio: 0.47). Conclusions: The overall mortality tended to be higher in Crohn's disease patients than in the general population; it was slightly lower in ulcerative colitis patients than in the general population.",118
"The Wiener-Hopf factorization of a complex function arises in a variety of fields in applied mathematics such as probability, finance, insurance, queuing theory, radio engineering and fluid mechanics. The factorization fully characterizes the distribution of functionals of a random walk or a Levy process, such as the maximum, the minimum and hitting times. Here we propose a constructive procedure for the computation of the Wiener-Hopf factors, valid for both single and double barriers, based on the combined use of the Hilbert and the z-transform. The numerical implementation can be simply performed via the fast Fourier transform and the Euler summation. Given that the information in the Wiener-Hopf factors is strictly related to the distributions of the first passage times, as a concrete application in mathematical finance we consider the pricing of discretely monitored exotic options, such as lookback and barrier options, when the underlying price evolves according to an exponential Levy process. We show that the computational cost of our procedure is independent of the number of monitoring dates and the error decays exponentially with the number of grid points. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"Surface remote sensing of aerosol properties provides ground truth for satellite and model validation and is an important component of aerosol observation system. Due to the different characteristics of background aerosol variability, information obtained at different locations usually has different spatial representativeness, implying that the location should be carefully chosen so that its measurement could be extended to a greater area. In this study, we present an objective observation array design technique that automatically determines the optimal locations with the highest spatial representativeness based on the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) theory. The ensemble is constructed using aerosol optical depth (AOD) products from five satellite sensors. The optimal locations are solved sequentially by minimizing the total analysis error variance, which means that observations at these locations will reduce the background error variance to the largest extent. The location determined by the algorithm is further verified to have larger spatial representativeness than some other arbitrary location. In addition to the existing active Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites, the 40 selected optimal locations are mostly concentrated on regions with both high AOD inhomogeneity and its spatial representativeness, namely, the Sahel, South Africa, East Asia, and North Pacific Islands. These places should be the focuses of establishing future AERONET sites in order to further reduce the uncertainty in the monthly mean AOD. Observations at these locations contribute to approximately 50% of the total background uncertainty reduction.",94
"The structure of the telomeres of four aphid species (Acyrthosiphon pisum, Megoura viciae, Myzus persicae and Rhopalosiphum padi) was evaluated by Southern blotting and fluorescent in situ hybridization, revealing that each chromosomal end consists of a (TTAGG) (n) repeat. The presence of a telomerase coding gene has been verified successively in the A. pisum genome, revealing that aphid telomerase shares sequence identity ranging from 12% to 18% with invertebrate and vertebrate homologues, and possesses the two main domains involved in telomerase activity. Interestingly, telomerase expression has been verified in different somatic tissues suggesting that, in aphids, telomerase activity is not as restricted as in human cells. The study of telomeres in a M. persicae strain with a variable chromosome number showed that aphid telomerase can initiate the de novo synthesis of telomere sequences at internal breakpoints, resulting in the stabilization of chromosomal fragments.",39
"In order to provide a realistic basis for structural damage identification and safety evaluation of long-span bridges, the modal parameters of a kilometer-scale cable-stayed bridge are identified using the wavelet transform (WT) method. Sutong cable-stayed bridge (SCB), which was excited by typhoon Haikui, was taken as the research object. Based on the structural vibration responses recorded by structural health monitoring system (SHMS) of SCB, modal parameters including the frequency and the damping ratio of the bridge were identified using the WT method. Four vertical, two torsional, and one lateral modes were selected for analysis. After comparing the analysis results with those from the related references, the whole-process variation of modal parameters of the SCB during typhoon Haikui was investigated. Furthermore, the relationship between modal parameters and wind speed was analyzed. Results show that the modal parameter identification based on the WT method is stable and reliable. The influence of wind speed on modal frequencies is small. However, its influence on modal damping ratios is remarkable and shows some of regularity. With the increase of wind speed, the first four vertical and first torsional modal damping ratios increase while the first lateral and second torsional modal damping ratios decrease.

"Recent work has demonstrated the importance of post-transcriptional gene regulation in toxic responses. In the present study, we used two rat models to investigate mRNA translation in the liver following xenobiotic-induced toxicity. By combining polysome profiling with genomic methodologies, we were able to assess global changes in hepatic mRNA translation. Dio3 (iodothyronine deiodinase type III) was identified as a gene that exhibited specific translational repression and had a functional role in a number of relevant canonical pathways. Western blot analysis indicated that this repression led to reduced D3 (the protein expressed by Dio3) levels, enhanced over time and with increased dose. Using Northern blotting techniques and qRT-PCR (quantitative reverse transcription-PCR), we confirmed further that there was no reduction in Dio3 mRNA, suggesting that translational repression of Dio3 is an important determinant of the reduced D3 protein expression following liver damage. Finally, we show that drug-induced hepatotoxicity appears to cause localized disruptions in thyroid hormone levels in the liver and plasma. We suggest that this leads to reduced translation of Dio3 mRNA, which results in decreased D3 production. It may therefore be possible that this is an important mechanism by which the liver can, upon early signs of damage, act rapidly to maintain its own energy equilibrium, thereby avoiding global disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.",38

This paper mainly introduced PhoneGap, Sencha Touch, Titanium and AppCan cross platform development framework, compared to their advantages and disadvantages, and analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of cross platform mobile hybrid mobile development mode based on HTML5. Finally, this paper looked forward to the development of HTML5 and development technology of cross platform hybrid mobile application based on HTML5.",68
"Medical ultrasonic imaging has been utilized in a variety of clinical diagnoses for many years. Recently, because of the needs of portable and mobile medical ultrasonic diagnoses, the development of real-time medical ultrasonic imaging algorithms on embedded computing platforms is a rising research direction. Typically, delay-and-sum beamforming algorithm is implemented on embedded medical ultrasonic scanners. Such algorithm is the easiest to implement at real-time frame rate, but the image quality of this algorithm is not high enough for complicated diagnostic cases. As a result, minimum-variance adaptive beamforming algorithm for medical ultrasonic imaging is considered in this paper, which shows much higher image quality than that of delay-and-sum beamforming algorithm. However, minimumvariance adaptive beamforming algorithm is a complicated algorithm with O(n(3)) computational complexity. Consequently, it is not easy to implement such algorithm on embedded computing platform at real-time frame rate. On the other hand, GPU is a well-known parallel computing platform for image processing. Therefore, embedded GPU computing platform is considered as a potential real-time implementation platform of minimum-variance beamforming algorithm in this paper. By applying the described effective implementation strategies, the GPU implementation of minimum-variance beamforming algorithm performed more than 100 times faster than the ARM implementation on the same heterogeneous embedded platform. Furthermore, platform power consumptions, computation energy efficiency, and platform cost efficiency of the experimental heterogeneous embedded platforms were also evaluated, which demonstrated that the investigated heterogeneous embedded computing platforms were suitable for real-time portable or mobile high-quality medical ultrasonic imaging device constructions.",101
"Online social networks (OSNs) gradually integrate financial capabilities by enabling the usage of real and virtual currency. They serve as new platforms to host a variety of business activities, such as online promotion events, where users can possibly get virtual currency as rewards by participating in such events. Both OSNs and business partners are significantly concerned when attackers instrument a set of accounts to collect virtual currency from these events, which make these events ineffective and result in significant financial loss. It becomes of great importance to proactively detecting these malicious accounts before the online promotion activities and subsequently decreases their priority to be rewarded. In this paper, we propose a novel system, namely ProGuard, to accomplish this objective by systematically integrating features that characterize accounts from three perspectives including their general behaviors, their recharging patterns, and the usage of their currency. We have performed extensive experiments based on data collected from the Tencent QQ, a global leading OSN with built-in financial management activities. Experimental results have demonstrated that our system can accomplish a high detection rate of 96.67% at a very low false positive rate of 0.3%.",46
"Introduction: Assessment is a central part of student learning. Student involvement in peer assessment leads to significant improvement in students' performance, supports students' learning, promotes the development of evaluation skills and encourages reflection. Aim: The aim of this study is to assess perceptions of the Formative Peer Assessment (FPA) initiative within a higher education setting for undergraduate radiography students. Methods: Qualitative action research was conducted. Students were allowed to anonymously assess each other's assignments using a standardized evaluation sheet that they had been trained to use. Participants' perceptions were assessed through focus group discussion. Results: The findings showed that students' experiences with peer assessment were positive. Students acknowledged that they received valuable feedback and learned from assessing their peers. Students recommended the need for training and suggested using more than one evaluator. Conclusion: The FPA initiative in the study institution believed to be succeed as the students had a positive experience with the FPA. Students learnt from PA and from self-assessment. Implementation of PA will promote reflection and critical thinking and problem solving skills, that are important traits in radiography graduate profile as in radiography clinical practice the professional require to modify imaging techniques and critique images to ensure the quality of care.

"Bullous pemfigoid (BP), an autoimmune disorder, can also be induced by some medications. Vildagliptin is a new drug used to treat diabetes mellitus (DM). Recently, a few cases of vildagliptin-induced BP have been described in the literature. We report a patient with BP in which vildagliptin was thought to be as a possible causative agent. The awareness of BP development risk during gliptin therapy can prevent unnecessary usage of systemic drugs with serious side effects.",120
"Background. Although Ureaplasma species are the most common organisms associated with prematurity, their effects on the maternal and fetal immune system remain poorly characterized. Methods. Rhesus macaque dams at approximately 80% gestation were injected intra-amniotically with 10(7) colony-forming units of Ureaplasma parvum or saline (control). Fetuses were delivered surgically 3 or 7 days later. We performed comprehensive assessments of inflammation and immune effects in multiple fetal and maternal tissues. Results. Although U. parvum grew well in amniotic fluid, there was minimal chorioamnionitis. U. parvum colonized the fetal lung, but fetal systemic microbial invasion was limited. Fetal lung inflammation was mild, with elevations in CXCL8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, and CCL2 levels in alveolar washes at day 7. Inflammation was not detected in the fetal brain. Significantly, U. parvum decreased regulatory T cells (Tregs) and activated interferon gamma production in these Tregs in the fetus. It was detected in uterine tissue by day 7 and induced mild inflammation and increased expression of connexin 43, a gap junction protein involved with labor. Conclusions. U. parvum colonized the amniotic fluid and caused uterine inflammation, but without overt chorioamnionitis. It caused mild fetal lung inflammation but had a more profound effect on the fetal immune system, decreasing Tregs and polarizing them toward a T-helper 1 phenotype.",33
"It is not currently well-understood how much xylem conductance is lost in maize plants during the day, if conductance is recovered during the night, or what soil water conditions are required for recovery to take place. To answer these questions we designed a greenhouse experiment whereby two genetically dissimilar maize genotypes were subjected to a level of water stress commonly experienced in the field (Psi(xylem) similar to -2 MPa). We then measured the loss of stem-specific conductivity associated with this level of stress, as well as the overnight recovery following three re-watering treatments: Psi(soil) similar to 0 MPa, Psi(soil) similar to -0.40 MPa, and Psi(soil) similar to -1.70 MPa. Mid-day leaf water potentials of -1.98 MPa resulted in stem-specific conductivity (K-S) values that were 31.5% of maximal (i.e., 68% loss). Returning soils to field capacity (Psi(soil) similar to 0 MPa) overnight allowed for the significant recovery of K-S (76% of maximal), whereas partial watering (Psi(soil) similar to -0.40 MPa) resulted K-S values that were 51.7% of maximal values, whereas not watering resulted in no recovery (35.4% of maximal; Psi(soil) similar to -1.7 MPa). Recovery of K-S was facilitated by the generation of root pressure and low rates of nighttime transpiration.",83
"In Manufacturing Engineering, there are several areas of knowledge focused on the study of manufacturing processes that give rise to products supplied to the processing industries and products to final consumers that can be processed from sheet, wires, rods and beams. In both cases, one of the most widely used manufacturing processes is the ""Metal Forming"" which is the mechanical process that pieces can be obtained by compression of solid metal in molds using plastic deformation of the material for filling the molds cavities. However, there is a process that can do the same without the need for molds, the so-called incremental sheet forming which consists of drawing the workpiece on a CNC form milling using a small cylindrical punch with a rounded tip. The purpose of this work is to make a study of the process of incremental sheet forming of polymers as a new type of rapid prototyping technology that is based on the process of forming material, different from the existing processes for removing or adding material. The tests were done in a geometry pyramid trunk format, in three subsequent stages and the objective is to evaluate some parameters such as temperature of working and the punch diameter in the final result of the prototype. The material chosen for the study was the PVC because that is present in many studies already done on the subject. Tests made with PVC indicated that a variation in 20 degrees C of material working temperature resulted in a significant increase in forming results during the tests.",84
"Compared with Computer Aided Design (CAD) to use computer graphics technologies to describe geometric information for the product design, many new methodologies and systems have been developed in the past decades in product modeling to extend the functions of the traditional CAD systems. In the product representation aspect, in addition to the design solution usually modeled by geometric descriptions, modeling of product knowledge has been widely investigated to describe the rationale for creation of the product solution. In the information technology aspect, in addition to the traditional computing tools such as computer programming languages and object oriented design, distributed computing technologies particularly Internet, web and cloud computing tools have been widely employed to implement product modeling systems. In the product development process aspect, in addition to the design solution, other product lifecycle aspects such as manufacturing, maintenance and service have been modeled and integrated into the same environment. In this literature review, the recent advances of research on product modeling in product representation, information technologies and product development process are investigated from these three new perspectives: knowledge, distributed computing, and product lifecycle. In addition, traditional methodologies and future challenges in computer-based product modeling are also discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",79
"In present paper we would like to share some experiences of building new education in Sports Technology at Mid Sweden University and the results of 10 years of successfully running it in Ostersund. The Sports Technology education at Mid Sweden University started at Campus Ostersund in 2003 as a part of the curriculum of the Engineering Department. This specialization was initially at the three-year Bachelor level, and later it was extended to an additional two-year Master level. Aiming at the quality of Sports Technology education, three keystones are underlying its process, representing the solid knowledge base, capacity to be flexible in problem solving and the use an innovative approaches. The Department unites researches with a background in both natural sciences and engineering disciplines, having a wide experience of working with and within the industry, equally active in research and teaching. The unique constellation of the profiles forming the Department include not only the SportsTech (R) group, being ""the backbone"", but also the Ecology and Eco-technology, and Quality Technology groups bringing the excellence and extra competence needed to assure the quality of the Sports Technology education. We were the first higher education institution in Sweden to give this kind of education program and now some other Swedish Universities have followed us. Our success can be measured by a number of graduates taking good jobs in the industry. We also enjoy a steady flow of new students coming from all parts of Sweden, and Sports Technology education stays among the most desirable ones in the country. (C) 2013 The Authors.

"In spite the many observational and experimental studies on the relations between television and violence found in the literature, there is still no agreement about an eventual causal relationship. Even if most authors have observed a positive correlation between both variables, these do not have to be necessarily causal; both might depend of a third factor. Although most results show eventual short term causal effects of mass media on violent behavior, some ones suggest the opposite direction of the effect, a third group suggest rather bidirectional influences, and finally other authors talk about the cathartic effects of some violent programs. The final part of the article suggests some possible psychological models as explanation of the eventual relationship between both variables.",74
"The network systems of the world are fragile, and can come under attack from any source. The attack can be a denial-of-service (DoS) state or another type of threat. What keep the networks safe are the intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS). They constantly monitor network traffic and if a malicious threat is detected, the threat is blocked and reported for further analysis. However, every defensive system must always have some type of weakness. False negatives and false positives are some examples of how IDPS can fail to protect the network. In another instance, a skilled attacker may employ Direct Kernel Object Modification (DKOM) to trick the IDPS into detecting no malicious activities. The IDPS is strong, yet not strong enough. This paper presents a hybrid solution that incorporates both signature and anomaly based systems to detect and prevent more malicious attacks by intensifying what is cataloged to include common anomalies to the baselines used by the signature based systems. We also propose an improvement in the framework to current Host IDPS/Network using signature and anomaly based methodologies by implementing a hybrid VMM-based Honeypot into a theorized self-healing hybrid IDPS to further boost their advantages in efficiency and accuracy.

"Context: Software defect prediction (SDP) is an important task in software engineering. Along with estimating the number of defects remaining in software systems and discovering defect associations, classifying the defect-proneness of software modules plays an important role in software defect prediction. Several machine-learning methods have been applied to handle the defect-proneness of software modules as a classification problem. This type of yes or no decision is an important drawback in the decision-making process and if not precise may lead to misclassifications. To the best of our knowledge, existing approaches rely on fully automated module classification and do not provide a way to incorporate extra knowledge during the classification process. This knowledge can be helpful in avoiding misclassifications in cases where system modules cannot be classified in a reliable way. Objective:We seek to develop a SDP method that (i) incorporates a reject option in the classifier to improve the reliability in the decision-making process; and (ii) makes it possible postpone the final decision related to rejected modules for an expert analysis or even for another classifier using extra domain knowledge. Method: We develop a SDP method called rejoELM and its variant, IrejoELM. Both methods were built upon the weighted extreme learning machine (ELM) with reject option that makes it possible postpone the final decision of non-classified modules, the rejected ones, to another moment. While rejoELM aims to maximize the accuracy for a rejection rate, IrejoELM maximizes the F-measure. Hence, IrejoELM becomes an alternative for classification with reject option for imbalanced datasets. Results: rejoEM and IrejoELM are tested on five datasets of source code metrics extracted from real world open-source software projects. Results indicate that rejoELM has an accuracy for several rejection rates that is comparable to some state-of-the-art classifiers with reject option. Although IrejoELM shows lower accuracies for several rejection rates, it clearly outperforms all other methods when the F-measure is used as a performance metric. Conclusion: It is concluded that rejoELM is a valid alternative for classification with reject option problems when classes are nearly equally represented. On the other hand, IrejoELM is shown to be the best alternative for classification with reject option on imbalanced datasets. Since SDP problems are usually characterized as imbalanced learning problems, the use of IrejoELM is recommended. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",123
"1. A model that predicts human metabolism and disposition of drug candidates would be of value in early drug development. 2. In this study, a chimeric (uPA+/+)/SCID mouse model was evaluated with three structurally distinct compounds (GW695634, a benzophenone, SB-406725, a tetrahydroisoquinoline and GW823093, a fluoropyrrolidine) for which human metabolism and disposition was characterized. Human metabolite profiles in plasma and/or urine were compared to those of chimeric (uPA+/+)/SCID and control CD-1 or (uPA+/+)/SCID) mice. GW695634 and SB-406725 exhibited primarily hepatic metabolism and were chosen as probes to assess which human metabolites would likely circulate systemically. GW823093 exhibited a combination of hepatic and extrahepatic metabolism such that renal excretion of drug-related material was similar to 2-fold greater in humans than in mice, and thus chosen as a probe to assess if the chimeric (uPA+/+)/SCID mouse would predict the urinary excretion of human metabolites. 3. We observed that human metabolism and disposition was well represented for GW695634, somewhat represented for GW823093 and minimally represented for SB-406725. Collectively, the results of this and other studies suggest that while limitations for prediction of human metabolism and disposition exist, humanized chimeric mouse models can potentially represent informative new tools in drug discovery and development.",32
"Introduction. Lesbian and bisexual (LB) women have higher body weight than heterosexual women. Interventions focused on health and well-being versus weight loss may be more likely to succeed among LB women. This article describes effects of Women's Health and Mindfulness, a 12-week pilot intervention addressing mindfulness, healthy eating, and physical activity, on outcomes associated with chronic disease risk among overweight and obese LB women older than 40 years. Method. Eighty women were randomized, using a stepped-wedge design, to either an immediate- or a delayed-start intervention group; the delayed-start group served as the control. Eligible participants were aged 40 years or older, identified as LB, and had a body mass index of 27 or greater. We compared differences in biological markers of chronic disease, mindfulness, nutrition, and physical activity between immediate- and delayed-start intervention groups. Results. We observed clinically significant improvements in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but no change in hemoglobin A1c. We found evidence of intervention effects on improved mindfulness and mindful eating scores and on nutrition (improved vegetable intake). Conclusions. The Women's Health and Mindfulness pilot intervention appears to have initiated positive behavioral and physical health changes in this population. Refinements to the intervention model, such as extended intervention duration, and longer term follow-up are warranted to determine sustained effects.",121
"Heterogeneous nanostructures, such as quanturn dots (QDs) embedded in solid matrices or core-shell nanoparticles, are promising platforms for a wide variety of applications, including phosphors with increased quantum yield, photocatalysis, and solar energy conversion. However, characterizing and controlling their interfacial morphology and defects, which greatly influence their electronic properties, have proven difficult in numerous cases. Here we carried out atomistic calculations on chalcogenide nano structured materials, i.e, PbSe QDs in CdSe matrices and CdSe embedded in PbSe, and we established how interfacial and core structures affect their electronic properties. In particular, we showed that defects present at interfaces of PbSe nanopartides and CdSe matrices give rise to detrimental intragap states, degrading the performance of photovoltaic devices. Instead, the electronic gaps of the inverted system (CdSe dots in PbSe) are clean, indicating that this material has superior electronic properties for solar applications. In addition, our calculations predicted that the core structure of CdSe and in turn its band gap may be tuned by applying pressure to the PbSe matrix, providing a means to engineering the properties of new functional materials.",100
"This paper explores the large-signal and small-signal dynamics of a series-capacitor (SC) buck-type converter and introduces an optimal closed-loop control scheme to accommodate both the steady-state and transient modes. As opposed to a conventional buck converter, where time-optimal control is realized by a single on-off cycle, in the SC-buck topology there is a need to distribute the switching phases to satisfy the charge-balance of the flying capacitor. The new control method hybrids a voltage-mode small-signal controller for steady-state operation and a non-linear, state-plane based transient-mode control scheme for load transients. A detailed principle of operation of the SC-buck converter is provided and explained through an average behavioral model and state-plane analysis. The operation of the controller is experimentally verified on a 12W 12V-to-1.5V converter, demonstrating voltage-mode control operation as well as time-optimal response for load transients.",48
"Context: Increased activities of the arginine-vasopressin (AVP) system and the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis were shown to be associated with human obesity, but relationships between these systems in obesity remain unclear. Objectives: To assess HPA axis responsiveness and its relation to serum concentrations of the AVP-surrogate copeptin in subjects with obesity (OB) in comparison to non-obesity controls (NOC). Methods: In a cross-sectional monocentric study, thirty-nine OB (f/m 25/14; age 36.5 +/- 10.0 years; body mass index, BMI, 41.5 +/- 4.7 kg/m(2)) were compared to twenty-two NOC 12/10; age 35.3 +/- 8.5 years; BMI 23.1 +/- 2.4 kg/m(2)), matched for age and sex. All individuals underwent the combined dexamethasone/CRH test. Main outcome measures: Plasma ACTH and cortisol curve indicators derived from the dex/CRH test (post-CRH concentrations 30 min after 100 mu g CRH; maximum concentration, MAX; area-under-the-curve, AUC; ACTH/cortisol ratios). Copeptin was assessed in 1500 h samples of the dex/CRH test (after 1.5 mg of oral dexamethasone, prior to CRH administration). Results: Copeptin serum concentrations were higher in OB (median [IQR]: OB 4.62 [2.60-5.88] vs. NOC 3.04 [2.52-4.29] pmol/1, P=0.04). Correspondingly, OB showed higher post-CRH cortisol concentrations (OB: 51.5 [25.9-159.3] vs. NOC: 28.6 [20.0-41.6] nmol/1, P = 0.01) and a lower post-CRH ACTH/cortisol ratio (OB: 0.028 [0.016-0.053] vs. NOC: 0.048 [0.034-0.070] pmol/nmol, P < 0.01). Serum copeptin was significantly associated with HPA responsiveness in OB (post-CRH ACTH: R = 0.42, P < 0.01), driven by OB men (post-CRH ACTH: R=0.76, P < 0.01, post-CRH cortisol: R=0.64, P=0.02). All associations withstand adjustments for BMI and age. Conclusions: The association between increased copeptin with ACTH and cortisol release suggests a potential mechanistic interaction of the AVP system with HPA activation in human obesity. The relation of copeptin and HPA responsiveness should be further validated in situations with pronounced HPA activation, such as depression or multiple sclerosis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"Background: Three successive editions of the International Classification of Headache Disorders and multiple guideline papers on headache care have described evidence based diagnosis and treatment of headache disorders. It remains unknown, however, to which extent this has improved the diagnosis and management of headache. That was the aim of our study in which we also analysed differences between three social groups in Russia. Methods: We studied 1042 students (719 females, 323 males, mean age 20.6, age range 17-40), 1075 workers (146 females, 929 males, mean age 40.4, age range 21-67) and 1007 blood donors (484 females, 523 males, mean age 34.1, age range 18-64). We conducted a semi-structured, validated, face-to-face professional interview. Data on prevalence and associated factors have previously been published. A section of the interview focused on previous diagnosis and treatment, the topic of this paper. Results: Only 496 of 2110 participants (23%) with headache in Russia had consulted because of headache. Students consulted more frequently (35%), workers and blood donors less often (13% and 14%). Only 12% of the patients with ICHD-3beta diagnosis of migraine and 11.7% with ICHD-3beta diagnosis of tension-type headache (TTH) had previously been correctly diagnosed. Triptans were used by only 6% of migraine patients. Only 0.4% of migraine patients and no TTH patients had received prophylactic treatment. Conclusion: Despite existing guidelines about diagnosis and treatment, both remain poor in Russia. According to the literature this is only slightly better in Europe and America. Dissemination of existing knowledge should have higher priority in the future.",127

"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of Guizhi Gancao Longgu Muli Tang (GGLMT), a decoction prepared with herbal medicine of Traditional Chinese Medicine, on sleep disturbances in women with menopause. METHODS: Totally 162 participants were recruited for the treatment of sleep difficulty from February, 2012 to December, 2014. Decoction of 200 mL was taken by every participant twice daily in half an hour after lunch and dinner during two weeks. Sleep quality was assessed by Pittsburg sleep quality index (PSQI) and menopausal symptoms and quality of life were evaluated by the menopause rating scale (MRS) and the Chinese version of World Health Organization quality of life-BREF at the final fellow -up in the fourth weekend after beginning. RESULTS: The average scores of PSQI had reduced from' (13.82 +/- 4.97) to (8.14 +/- 3.19), 95% CI (-4.87, -3.05) after 2-week GGLMT treatment in the fourth week. GGLMT improved symptoms in patients with more severe conditions (MRS >= 16). Three adver'se drLig reaction, mouth ulcer, constipation, and folliculitis, might be related with GGLMT and disappeared after withdrawals of the treatment. CONCLUSION: For menopausal.women suffering from chronic sleep disturbances, our findings suggest that two weeks treatment of GGLMT was safe and effective. (C) 2017 JTCM. All rights reserved.",9

"Phase dynamics and phase noise of N coupled phase-locked loops (PLLs) with N independent oscillators are analyzed. The phase noise of coupled PLLs with independent oscillators is analyzed by using the signal flow graph and Mason's gain rules. The near-carrier phase noise of PLL elements in the array can be reduced to 1/L that of a single independent (without coupling) VCO of the PLL element, and return to its free-running phase noise far from the carrier frequency, provided the coupling network is reciprocal, the feedback loop gain of the PLL elements is large, and the phase detector and amplifier noise are neglected. The phase dynamics and noise improvement of coupled PLL arrays are verified by using two coupled PLLs with independent GaAs MESFET oscillators operating at X-band.",56
"The purpose of this study is to find a motor topology which offers the best combination of both permanent magnet and reluctance torque components as well as the best possible torque per volume ratio. To perform this task a topological optimization method using genetic algorithms, embedded into experience based design is proposed.

Results obtained by the proposed optimization method are discussed and compared with results obtained using state-of-the art machine design.",85
"The accurately estimated state is of great importance for maintaining a stable running condition of power systems. To maintain the accuracy of the estimated state, bad data detection (BDD) is utilized by power systems to get rid of erroneous measurements due to meter failures or outside attacks. However, false data injection (FDI) attacks, as recently revealed, can circumvent BDD and insert any bias into the value of the estimated state. Continuous works on constructing and/or protecting power systems from such attacks have been done in recent years. This survey comprehensively overviews three major aspects: constructing FDI attacks; impacts of FDI attacks on electricity market; and defending against FDI attacks. Specifically, we first explore the problem of constructing FDI attacks, and further show their associated impacts on electricity market operations, from the adversary's point of view. Then, from the perspective of the system operator, we present countermeasures against FDI attacks. We also outline the future research directions and potential challenges based on the above overview, in the context of FDI attacks, impacts, and defense.",43
"Purpose: The aim of this study was to describe nocturia with or without leakage in a population of patients with multiple sclerosis. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective, single center study of 309 patients with multiple sclerosis who were followed at an experienced neurourology center between 2011 and 2013. All patients had daytime urinary symptoms associated with this disorder. Among the patients with nocturia 2 groups were defined, including those with isolated nocturia but without nocturnal urinary incontinence and patients with nocturia associated with nocturnal urinary incontinence. The control group comprised patients without nocturia. The clinical variables and urodynamic data studied were gender, age, EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale), the USP (Urinary Symptoms Profile) questionnaire overactive bladder score, bladder capacity, detrusor activity and volume at the first detrusor contraction. Results: Of our patients 53.3% had nocturia, including 35.7% with nocturnal urinary incontinence. The average +/- SD USP overactive bladder score was statistically greater in patients with nocturia than in controls (9.14 +/- 4.3 vs 5.1 +/- 3.5, p = 8.21E-17). Mean maximum cystometric capacity was statistically higher in the control group than in patients with nocturia (380.17 +/- 113.79 vs 313 +/- 128.4 ml, p = 5.60E-6). A similar outcome was found for the first contraction (mean 232.58 +/- 146.05 vs 181.14 +/- 100.11 ml, p = 0.041). Conclusion: Isolated nocturia or nocturnal urinary incontinence is a frequent problem encountered with multiple sclerosis. Our results suggest that an overactive detrusor is the main mechanism. Further studies are needed to verify the complications arising from nocturia.",17
"In this paper, the authors present a polarisation dependent analytical model for DC, radio frequency (RF) and linearity characteristics of a proposed lattice-matched AlInN/AlN/GaN metal-oxide-semiconductor high electron mobility transistor (MOSHEMT). The developed model includes charge controlled analysis derived from triangular potential well approximation along with the spontaneous and piezoelectric polarisation effects. The model accurately predicts the threshold voltage, two-dimensional electron gas sheet charge density, drain current, transconductance and cut-off frequencies for different samples of gate dielectric materials such as SiO2, HfO2 and Al2O3 over a full range of gate and drain bias. A detailed analysis of the linearity characteristics by investigating the key figure-of-merit metrics such as second-order voltage intercept point, third-order voltage intercept point, third-order input intercept point and third-order intermodulation distortion are performed for different gate dielectric thicknesses of 5, 7 and 10 nm. The accuracy of the model results is verified against Silvaco Technology Computer Aided Design numerical simulation results and found to be satisfactory. It is observed that by careful tuning the device parameters such as dielectric constant and dielectric thickness, lattice-matched AlInN/AlN/GaN MOSHEMT can considerably improve the device performance and suitable for high performance low distortion RF applications.",82
"Participatory approaches elicit information from multiple stakeholders while planning and implementing resource management systems. Such elicited information is often associated with significant variability. Public participation geographical information science (GIS) (PP-GIS) solutions can reduce this variability by helping stakeholders to measure the factors involved and provide the elicited information. We propose a Quality Function Deployment'-based participatory framework for developing such PP-GIS solutions. It is demonstrated using a case study to enhance an existing PP-GIS into a solution for rainwater harvesting systems in Indian villages. The novelty of the proposed framework is that it identifies metrics and carries out comparative analysis of three existing solutions: participatory rural appraisal, participatory mapping and PP-GIS. In the case study, PP-GIS scored less than participatory mapping as it scored less on usability and affordability. To improve PP-GIS in these aspects, an easy-to-use mobile and web based, free and open source PP-GIS solution, Watershed GIS, was developed. It scored better than the three existing solutions and its usage resulted in substantial reduction of variability in criteria values and thus better ranking of alternatives, with the average coefficient of variation decreasing from 0.12 to 0.05.",95
"In this work we present an efficient interferometric processing chain, based on the advanced DInSAR algorithm referred to as Parallel Small BAseline Subset (P-SBAS), for the generation of Sentinel-1A (S1A) Interferometric Wide Swath deformation time-series, which is able to exploit distributed computing architectures. The presented S1A P-SBAS processing chain has been successfully implemented within the ESA Geohazard Exploitation Platform to provide an on-demand automatic service for the unsupervised generation of P-SBAS displacement time-series. To give an idea of the effectiveness of the presented S1A processing chain, as a preliminary result we show a 12-days interferometric analysis at continental scale, carried out by exploiting 150 S1A interferometric pairs acquired over Europe for an overall covered area of about 7,500,000 km(2).",2
"Steam injection and turbocompouding are both effective methods for engine waste heat recovery. The fuel saving potential obtained by the combination of the two methods is not clear. Based on a turbocompound engine developed in the previous study, the impacts of pre-turbine steam injection on the fuel saving potentials, of the turbocompound engine were investigated in this paper. Firstly, thermodynamic cycle model for the baseline turbocompound engine is established using commercial software GT-POWER. The cycle model is calibrated with the experiment data of the turbocompound engine and achieves high accuracy. After that, the influences of steam mass flow rate, evaporating pressure and injection location on the engine performance are studied. In addition, the impacts of hot liquid water injection are also investigated. The results show that steam injection at the turbocharger turbine inlet can reduce the turbocompound engine BSFC at all speed conditions. The largest fuel reduction 6.15% is obtained at 1000 rpm condition. However, steam injection at power turbine inlet can only lower the BSFC at high speed conditions. Besides, it is found that hot liquid water injection in the exhaust cannot improve the engine performance. When compared with the conventional turbocharged engine, the combination of turbocompounding and steam injection can reduce the BSFC by 6.0-11.2% over different speeds. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Background: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an inherited cerebral microangiopathy presenting with variable features, including migraine, psychiatric disorders, stroke, and cognitive decline and variable disability. On neuroimaging, CADASIL is characterized by leukoencephalopathy, multiple lacunar infarcts, and microbleeds. Previous studies suggest a possible role of endothelial impairment in the pathogenesis of the disease. Methods: We assessed plasma levels of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and thrombomodulin (TM) and the blood levels of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and circulating progenitor cells (CPCs) in 49 CADASIL patients and 49 age-matched controls and their association with clinical/ functional and neuroimaging features. Results: In multivariate analysis, CADASIL patients had significantly higher vWF and lower EPC levels. TM levels were similar in the 2 groups. CADASIL patients with a more severe clinical phenotype (history of stroke or dementia) presented lower CPC levels in comparison with patients with a milder phenotype. On correlation analysis, lower CPC levels were associated with worse performances on neuropsychological, motor and functional tests, and with higher lesion load on brain magnetic resonance imaging (degree of leukoencephalopathy and number of lacunar infarcts). Conclusions: This is the first CADASIL series in which multiple circulating biomarkers have been studied. Our findings support previous studies on the presence and the possible modulating effect of endothelial impairment in the disease. Furthermore, our research data suggest that blood CPCs may be markers of disease severity.",10
"Background: This randomized prospective study was designed to assess whether piperacillin/tazobactam (PIPC/TAZ) is as effective as meropenem (MEPM) as a first-line antibiotic treatment for febrile neutropenia (FN). Procedure: FN episodes were randomly assigned to receive either PIPC/TAZ(337.5 mg/kg per day in three doses, 1-hr DIV, maximum 13.5 g per day) or MEPM (120 mg/kg per day in three doses, 1-hr DIV, maximum 3 g per day). Clinical responses were evaluated 120 hr after the DIV. Results: A total of 434 febrile episodes in 105 patients (42 females and 63 males) with a median age of 8 years (range 0-25) were included in this trial. Blood cultures were positive in 47 out of the 434 episodes (10.8%). Regarding responses to the treatment, success rates between the PIPC/TAZ and MEPM groups were similar (62.4 vs. 65.9%, P = 0.484), even if patients were restricted to those with bacteremia (26.1 vs 37.5%, P= 0.534). Mortality rates did not significantly differ between the two groups (0.8 vs. 0%, P = 0.500). Conclusion: Both PIPC/TAZ and MEPM appeared to be equally efficacious and safe. Carbapenems are now broadly used to treat FN; however, this may increase the prevalence of drug-resistant bacteria. In this regard, the treatment using PIPC/TAZ for FN is more beneficial.",14
"The role of behavioral genetic evidence in excusing and mitigating criminal behavior is unclear. Research has suggested that a low activity genotype of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAOA-L) may increase the risk for aggressive and antisocial behavior. By examining criminal proceedings in which MAOA-L genotype evidence was introduced, we explored the forensic uses of behavioral genetic science. Westlaw and LexisNexis legal databases were electronically searched for cases from 1995 to 2016 to identify court documents from cases involving the MAOA-L genotype. Evidence of the MAOA-L genotype was included in records from 11 criminal cases (9 U.S. and 2 Italian). In the guilt phase, genotype evidence was ruled admissible in one of two cases, and may have contributed to a conviction on a lesser charge. In the sentencing phaSe, genotype evidence was admissible in four of five cases, one of which ended with a lesser sentence. Five cases used genotype evidence for post-conviction appeals, two of which resulted in sentence reductions. Even when charges or sentences are reduced it is difficult to gauge the effect of evidence of the MAOA-L genotype. Genotype evidence may lack persuasive effect because the impact of the allele on a particular accused is difficult to establish. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",73
"Genetic sequences of multiple genes are becoming increasingly common for a wide range of organisms including viruses, bacteria and eukaryotes. While such data may sometimes be treated as a single locus, in practice, a number of biological and statistical phenomena can lead to phylogenetic incongruence. In such cases, different loci should, at least as a preliminary step, be examined and analysed separately. The R software has become a popular platform for phylogenetics, with several packages implementing distance-based, parsimony and likelihood-based phylogenetic reconstruction, and an even greater number of packages implementing phylogenetic comparative methods. Unfortunately, basic data structures and tools for analysing multiple genes have so far been lacking, thereby limiting potential for investigating phylogenetic incongruence. In this study, we introduce the new R package apex to fill this gap. apex implements new object classes, which extend existing standards for storing DNA and amino acid sequences, and provides a number of convenient tools for handling, visualizing and analysing these data. In this study, we introduce the main features of the package and illustrate its functionalities through the analysis of a simple data set.",41
"In order to combat chronic immune disorders (CIDs), it is an absolute necessity to understand the bigger picture, one that goes beyond insights at a one-disease, molecular, cellular, and static level. To unravel this bigger picture we advocate an integral, cross-disciplinary approach capable of embracing the complexity of the field. This paper discusses the current knowledge on common pathways in CIDs including general psychosocial and lifestyle factors associated with immune functioning. We demonstrate the lack of more in-depth psychosocial and lifestyle factors in current research cohorts and most importantly the need for an all-encompassing analysis of these factors. The second part of the paper discusses the challenges of understanding immune system dynamics and effectively integrating all key perspectives on immune functioning, including the patient's perspective itself. This paper suggests the use of techniques from complex systems science in describing and simulating healthy or deviating behavior of the immune system in its biopsychosocial surroundings. The patient's perspective data are suggested to be generated by using specific narrative techniques. We conclude that to gain more insight into the behavior of the whole system and to acquire new ways of combatting CIDs, we need to construct and apply new techniques in the field of computational and complexity science, to an even wider variety of dynamic data than used in today's systems medicine.",22
"Understanding the significance of efficiency improvement in an electric vehicle drivetrain system and the prospects of multi-phase electric motors, this paper discuses research findings elicited through a comparative performance analysis performed on commercially available in-vehicle conventional three-phase permanent magnet motor and modified dual stator winding permanent magnet motor derived from the conventional three-phase machine. Various electrical losses in both the machines have been estimated and compared through developed mathematical approach using analytical equations. The study performed here is exclusive to estimate the electrical losses in a multi-phase permanent magnet machine and provide decision points on various structural design indices of the machine before venturing into the FEA based machine design and assessment.",85
"Accurate predictions of fluid properties, such as density, oil formation volume factor and bubble point pressure, are essentials for all reservoir engineering calculations. In this paper, an approach based on nonlinear system identification modeling; Nonlinear ARX (NARX) and Hammerstein-Wiener (HW) predictive model, is proposed for forecasting the pressure/volume/temperature (PVT) properties of crude oil systems. To this end, two datasets; one containing 168 PVT samples from different Iranian oil reservoirs and other a databank containing 755 data from various geographical locations, were employed to construct (i.e. train) and evaluate (i.e. test) the models. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed NARX and HW models outperform previously employed methods including three types of artificial neural networks models (committee machine, multilayer perceptron and radial basis function), two types of ANFIS models (grid partition and fuzzy c-mean) and several empirical correlations with the smallest prediction error, and that they are reliable models for predicting the oil properties in reservoirs engineering among other soft computing approaches.

"This work presents the application of the power series method (PSM) to find solutions of partial differential-algebraic equations (PDAEs). Two systems of index-one and index-three are solved to show that PSM can provide analytical solutions of PDAEs in convergent series form. What is more, we present the post-treatment of the power series solutions with the Laplace-Pade (LP) resummation method as a useful strategy to find exact solutions. The main advantage of the proposed methodology is that the procedure is based on a few straightforward steps and it does not generate secular terms or depends of a perturbation parameter.",50
"Mutation of mevalonate kinase (MVK) is thought to account for most cases of hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome (HIDS) with recurrent fever. However, its mechanism and the relationship between elevated serum immunoglobulin D (IgD) and the clinical features of HIDS are unclear. In this study, we generated by fusion PCR a vector to express high levels of chimeric secretory IgD (csIgD) specifically in the liver. We then generated seven founder lines of transgenic mice by co-microinjection, and verified them using genomic PCR and Southern blotting. We detected the expression of csIgD by reverse transcription PCR, quantitative PCR, western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. We demonstrated that csIgD could be specifically and stably expressed in the liver. We used flow cytometry to show that overexpression of csIgD in the bone marrow and spleen cells had no effect on B cell development. Morphologic and anatomical observation of the transgenic mice revealed skin damage, hepatosplenomegaly, and nephromegaly in some transgenic mice; in these mice, pathological sections showed high levels of cell necrosis and protein-like sediments in the liver, spleen, and kidney. We demonstrated that the genomic insertion sites of the transgenes did not disrupt the MVK gene on mouse chromosome 5. This transgenic mouse will be useful to explore the pathogenesis of HIDS.",39
"Considering the importance of mother's support in the adaptation of a sexually abused child, it is relevant to determine if the mothers and children involved in an intergenerational cycle of child sexual victimization differ from dyads in which only the child has been abused. The purpose of this study was to compare mother-child dyads with sexually abused children according to whether the mother had herself been victim of child sexual abuse. The sample included 87 dyads with sexually abused children aged 3-18years old and their mothers (44 reporting maternal and child abuse), followed by social welfare services of the province of Quebec (Canada). The two groups of mothers were compared on their past family abuse experiences and past family relations, their mental health history, their current psychological distress, their parenting behaviors, and their current levels of family functioning. Children were compared on their adaptation. Multivariate analyses indicated that mothers reporting child sexual abuse were more likely to report more other maltreatments in their childhood and greater prevalence of lifetime history of alcohol abuse disorders, dysthymia, and panic disorder compared with mothers who had not experienced CSA. Compared to children whose mothers had not experienced CSA, those whose mothers had experienced CSA showed higher rates of problems behaviors and were more likely to report having been sexually abused by a trusted person. These results highlight the specific clinical needs for the assessment and treatment for sexually abused children whose mothers experienced child sexual abuse.",76
"The adverse effects of obesity of female reproduction have been extensively documented. However, there are few prospective studies that have examined preconception weight loss interventions. There is a need to develop successful interventions with significant weight loss and compliance and most importantly document the effects of preconception interventions on important perinatal outcomes such as live birth and the health of the infant and mother. The existing data from randomized trials that come closest to meeting these criteria have failed to document improved live-birth rates after the intervention compared with control groups. There is a tendency to equate favorable weight change both before and during pregnancy with a direct qualitative improvement in all perinatal outcomes, yet the results from the most successful treatment of morbid obesity, that is, bariatric surgery, with on average 40% weight loss, suggest a mixed risk-benefit ratio on perinatal outcomes. Although interventions to control gestational weight gain have been more completely studied than preconception ones, and have documented successful interventions to achieve appropriate weight gain, there is no clear evidence that controlling gestational weight gain actually improves any important perinatal outcome. Future studies must develop more successful and effective interventions, capture perinatal outcomes instead of weight change as the primary outcomes, use, at least preconception, new antiobesity drugs (in combination with other therapies), and study bariatric surgery in prospective trials to improve our understanding of the effectiveness of obesity treatment before pregnancy.

"The etiology of men's lower urinary tract storage and voiding symptoms involves a contribution from both detrusor and outlet. As such, treatment of benign prostatic enlargement (BPE)+/- benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) with standard alpha-adrenergic blockade and 5-alpha reductase inhibitor therapy may leave a population of men with persistent and bothersome urinary storage symptoms. An abundance of adequately powered, randomized, placebo-controlled trials indicate that the use of antimuscarinics and beta-3 adrenergic agonists, either alone or in combination with standard BPE/BPO therapy, leads to improvement in storage symptoms. At the same time, metrics associated with urinary emptying, such as maximumflow rate, post-void residual urinary volume, and incidence of treatment-associated urinary retention, appear to be stable and not significantly impacted by the addition of antimuscarinics.",17
"Model-based fault diagnosis has attracted considerable attention from researchers and developers of flight control systems, thanks to its hardware simplicity and cost-effectiveness. However, the airplane model, which is adopted commonly in fault diagnosis, only exists theoretically and is linearized in approximation. For this reason, uncertainties such as system non-linearity and subjectivity will degrade the fault diagnosis results. In this paper, we propose a novel actuator fault diagnosis scheme for flight control systems based on model identification techniques. With this scheme, system identification can be achieved with a linear model that uses a closed-loop subspace model identification algorithm, and a non-linear model that uses an extended state observer and neural networks. On this basis, the current actuator fault is estimated using an adaptive two-stage Kalman filter. Finally, the non-linear six-degree-of-freedom model of a B747 airplane is simulated in the Matlab/Simulink environment, where the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified from fault diagnosis tests.",49
"This paper proposes a parallel regression formulation to reduce the computational time of variable selection algorithms. The proposed strategy can be used for several forward algorithms in order to select uncorrelated variables that contribute for a better predictive capability of the model. Our demonstration of the proposed method include the use of Successive Projections Algorithm (SPA), which is an iterative forward technique that minimizes multicollinearity. SPA is traditionally used for variable selection in the context of multivariate calibration. Nevertheless, due to the need of calculating an inverse matrix for each insertion of a new variable in the model calibration, the computational performance of the algorithm may become impractical as the matrix size increases. Based on such limitation, this paper proposes a new strategy called Parallel Regressions (PR). PR strategy was implemented in the SPA to avoid the matrix inverse calculation of original SPA in order to increase the computational performance of the algorithm. It uses a parallel computing platform called Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) in order to exploit a Graphics Processing Unit, and was called SPA-PR-CUDA. For this purpose, we used a case study involving a large data set of spectral variables. The results obtained with SPA-PR-CUDA presented 37 times better performance compared to a traditional SPA implementation. Additionally, when compared to traditional algorithms we demonstrated that SPA-PR-CUDA may be a more viable choice for obtaining a model with a reduced prediction error value.",101
"The authors of this article respond to V.A. Nekhamkin's call to answer the counterfactual challenge of the past related to the question of surrendering Leningrad in the course of the Great Patriotic War. Refuting numerous pseudoscientific investigations of revisionists of the history of that war, the authors show the misanthropic essence of the Third Reich's plans with respect to the Soviet Union in general and Leningrad in particular and, using the logic of alternative history, analyze, first, possible actions of the military-political leadership of Nazi Germany in a situation similar to the blockade of Leningrad and, second, possible military consequences of the loss of the city on the Neva River. From the point of view of military science and humanitarian considerations, it is proved that the actions of the Soviet command in defending Leningrad were not only right but also that no alternative existed.",66
"This work outlines an equation-based formulation of a digital control program and transducer interacting with a continuous physical process, and an approach using the Coq theorem prover for verifying the performance of the combined hybrid system. Considering thermal dynamics with linear dissipation for simplicity, we focus on a generalizable, physically consistent description of the interaction of the real-valued temperature and the digital program acting as a thermostat. Of interest in this work is the discovery and formal proof of bounds on the temperature, the degree of variation, and other performance characteristics. Our approach explicitly addresses the need to mathematically represent the decision problem inherent in an analog-to-digital converter, which for rare values can take an arbitrarily long time to produce a digital answer (the so-called Buridan's Principle); this constraint ineluctably manifests itself in the verification of thermostat performance. Furthermore, the temporal causality constraints in the thermal physics must be made explicit to obtain a consistent model for analysis. We discuss the significance of these findings toward the verification of digital control for more complex physical variables and fields.",48
"Developing distributed applications, particularly those for distributed, real-time and embedded (DRE) systems, is a difficult and complex undertaking due to the need to address four major challenges: the complexity of programming interprocess communication, the need to support a wide range of services across heterogeneous platforms and promote reuse, the need to efficiently utilize resources, and the need to adapt to changing conditions. The first two challenges are addressed to a large extent by standardized, general-purpose middleware (e.g. CORBA, DCOM and Java RMI) through the use of a ""black-box"" approach, such as the object-oriented paradigm (frameworks and design patterns). The need to support a large variety and range of applications and application domains has resulted in very feature-rich implementations of these standardized middleware. However, such a feature-richness acts counteractive to resolving the remaining two challenges; instead it incurs excessive memory footprint and performance overhead, as well as increased cost of testing and maintenance. To address the four challenges all at once while leveraging the benefits of general-purpose middleware requires a scientific approach to specializing the middleware. Software engineering techniques, such as aspect-oriented programming (AOP), feature-oriented programming (FOP), and reflection make the specialization task simpler, albeit still requiring the DRE system developer to manually identify the system invariants, and sources of performance and memory footprint bottlenecks that drive the specialization techniques. Specialization reuse is also hampered due to a lack of common taxonomy to document the recurring specializations, and assess the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques. To address these requirements, this paper presents a case for an automated, multi-stage, feature-oriented middleware specialization process that improves both middleware developer productivity and middleware performance. Three specific contributions are made in this paper. First, contemporary middleware specialization research is framed in terms of a three-dimensional taxonomy. Second, the principles of separation of concerns are used in the context of this taxonomy to define six stages of a middleware specialization process lifecycle. Finally, a concrete implementation of the six stage, automated middleware specialization process is presented along with empirical data illustrating the benefits accrued using the framework.",123
"Optical cloaking has been one of unattainable dreams and just a subject in fiction until recently. Several different approaches to cloaking have been proposed and demonstrated: stealth technology, active camouflage and transformation optics. The last one would be the most formal approach modifying electromagnetic field around an object to be cloaked with metamaterials. While cloaking based on transformation optics, though valid only at single frequency, is experimentally demonstrated in microwave region, its operation in visible spectrum is still distant from realisation mainly owing to difficulty in fabricating metamaterial structure whose elements are much smaller than wavelength of light. Here we show that achromatic optical cloaking in visible spectrum is possible with the mere principle based on geometrical optics. In combining a pair of polarising beam splitters and right-angled prisms, rays of light to be obstructed by an object can make a detour to an observer, while unobstructed rays go straight through two polarising beam splitters. What is observed eventually through the device is simply background image as if nothing exists in between.",98
"The increase of violence against children is a diagnosed social problem in the Costa Rican society. This article focuses on the presence of an ideological bias in the opinion writings of the local newspapers: La Nacion and Diario Extra. It explains how some visions of the sources are ideological and do not contribute to the end of the violence, nor to an effective promotion of childrens Human Rights. In order to avoid violence we must develop a pro-children cultural change, complex multi-institutional social networking, children autonomy and a critic to the family institution.",76
"Theory suggests that as activation of pain concepts in memory increases, so too does subsequent pain perception. Previously, researchers have found that activating pain concepts in memory increases pain perception of subsequent painful stimuli, relative to neutral information. However, they have not attempted to quantify the nature of the association between information studied and ensuing pain perception. We subliminally presented words that had either a low or high degree of association to the word 'pain,' although this was only partially successful and some words were consciously perceived. Participants then received randomized laser heat stimuli, delivered at 1 of 3 intensity levels (low, moderate, high), and we measured the effect of this on behavioral and electrophysiological measures of pain. Participants (N = 27) rated moderate-and high-intensity laser stimuli as more painful after viewing high relative to low associates of pain; these effects remained present when we controlled for measures of mood, anxiety, and physical symptom reporting. Similar effects were observed physiologically, with higher stimulus negativity preceding after high relative to low associates and greater amplitudes for the N2 component of the laser-evoked potential after presentation of high associates in the moderate and high laser intensity conditions. These data support activation-based models of the effects of memory on pain perception. Perspective: Consistent with current theories of memory and pain, we found that high, relative to low activation of pain concepts in memory increased psychological and physiological responses to laser-induced pain. The effect remained regardless of whether participants showed conscious awareness of activation. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed. (C) 2016 by the American Pain Society",78
"In the setting of relational databases, the schema of the database provides a context in which the data should be interpreted. As a consequence, the quality of a relational database depends strongly on the assumption that data fits this context description. In this paper, we investigate the case where the information provided by an attribute value exceeds the framework provided by the schema. It is shown that such an information overflow can have two orthogonal causes: (i) data about multiple attributes are jointly stored as one attribute and (ii) data about multiple tuples are jointly stored as one tuple. Needless to say, such erroneous information storage deteriorates the quality of the database. In this paper, it is investigated how data quality can be improved by a split operator. The major difficulty hereby is to take into account the constraints that are present in a relational database. A generic algorithm is provided and tested on the well-know Cora dataset.",112
"Objective: Research in eating disorders (EDs) suggests that outcome variables other than that of the ED per se, such as the presence of comorbid disorders and overall functioning at follow-up, may influence the ED condition at that time. We sought to assess the factors potentially predicting these different outcome variables.Methods: Eighty-eight female adolescent in-patients with an ED were assessed on admission, discharge, and around one-year post-discharge using clinical interviews and self-rating questionnaires assessing ED and other relevant symptoms.Results: The mean body mass index (BMI) of patients with anorexia nervosa increased from admission to discharge and was maintained at follow-up. Twenty-eight patients were remitted at follow-up, whereas 48 and 12 patients had intermediate and poor ED-related outcome, respectively. Follow-up BMI was correlated with baseline BMI. Good ED-related outcome at follow-up according to accepted criteria was associated with more lifetime suicide attempts and more severe baseline ED symptomatology. Elevated psychiatric comorbidity at follow-up was associated with elevated baseline anxiety and with re-hospitalisation during the post-discharge follow-up period. Better academic/occupational functioning and social functioning at follow-up were associated with less lifetime suicide attempts, less re-hospitalisation and lower baseline anxiety.Conclusions: In EDs, diverse factors may predict different outcome variables.",67
"This article provides a conceptual framework for studying the effects of religion on consumer behavior, with the goal of stimulating future research at the intersection of these two topics. We delineate religion as a multidimensional construct and propose that religion affects consumer psychology and behavior through four dimensions beliefs, rituals, values, and community. For each dimension of religion, we offer definitions and measures, integrate previous findings from research in the psychology, consumer behavior, marketing, and religion literatures, and propose testable future research directions. With this conceptual framework and research agenda, we challenge consumer researchers to ask deeper questions about why religious affiliation and level of religiosity may be driving previously established differences in consumer behavior, and to uncover the psychological mechanisms underlying the effects. This framework complements and extends previous literature and provides a new delineated framework for considering research on the effects of religion on consumer behavior.

"In this work, the performance of dual-chamber microbial fuel cells (MFCs) constructed either with commonly used Nafion (R) proton exchange membrane or supported ionic liquid membranes (SILMs) was assessed. The behavior of MFCs was followed and analyzed by taking the polarization curves and besides, their efficiency was characterized by measuring the electricity generation using various substrates such as acetate and glucose. By using the SILMs containing either [C(6)mirn][PF6] or [Bmiml[NTf2] ionic liquids, the energy production of these MFCs from glucose was comparable to that obtained with the MFC employing polymeric Nafion (R) and the same substrate. Furthermore, the MFC operated with [Bmim] [NTf2]-based SILM demonstrated higher energy yield in case of low acetate loading (80.1 J g(-1) CODin m(-2) h(-1)) than the one with the polymeric Nafion N115 (59 J g(-1) CODin m(-2) h(-1)). Significant difference was observed between the two SILM-MFCs, however, the characteristics of the system was similar based on the cell polarization measurements. The results suggest that membrane-engineering applying ionic liquids can be an interesting subject field for bioelectrochemical system research. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",43
"Here, we report a method for time-resolved, longitudinal extraction and quantitative measurement of intracellular proteins and mRNA from a variety of cell types. Cytosolic contents were repeatedly sampled from the same cell or population of cells for more than 5 d through a cell-culture substrate, incorporating hollow 150-nm-diameter nanostraws (NS) within a defined sampling region. Once extracted, the cellular contents were analyzed with conventional methods, including fluorescence, enzymatic assays (ELISA), and quantitative real-time PCR. This process was nondestructive with >95% cell viability after sampling, enabling long-term analysis. It is important to note that the measured quantities from the cell extract were found to constitute a statistically significant representation of the actual contents within the cells. Of 48 mRNA sequences analyzed from a population of cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stemcells (hiPSC-CMs), 41 were accurately quantified. The NS platform samples from a select subpopulation of cells within a larger culture, allowing native cell-to-cell contact and communication even during vigorous activity such as cardiomyocyte beating. This platform was applied both to cell lines and to primary cells, including CHO cells, hiPSC-CMs, and human astrocytes derived in 3D cortical spheroids. By tracking the same cell or group of cells over time, this method offers an avenue to understand dynamic cell behavior, including processes such as induced pluripotency and differentiation.",30
"Seafood is the predominant food source of several organoarsenic compounds. Some seafood species, like crustaceans and seaweed, also contain inorganic arsenic (iAs), a well-known toxicant. It is unclear whether human biotransformation of ingested organoarsenicals from seafood result in formation of arsenicals of health concern. The present controlled dietary study examined the urinary excretion of arsenic compounds (total arsenic (tAs), iAs, AB (arsenobetaine), dimethylarsinate (DMA) and methylarsonate (MA)) following ingestion of a single test meal of seafood (cod, 780 mu g tAs, farmed salmon, 290 mu g tAs or blue mussel, 690 mu g tAs or potato (control, 110 mu g tAs)) in 38 volunteers. The amount of ingested tAs excreted via the urine within 0-72 h varied significantly among the groups: Cod, 74% (52-92%), salmon 56% (46-82%), blue mussel 49% (37-78%), control 45% (30-60%). The estimated total urinary excretion of AB was higher than the amount of ingested AB in the blue mussel group (112%) and also ingestion of cod seemed to result in more AB, indicating possible endogenous formation of AB from other organoarsenicals. Excretion of iAs was lower than ingested (13-22% of the ingested iAs was excreted in the different groups). Although the ingested amount of iAs + DMA + MA was low for all seafood groups (1.2-4.5% of tAs ingested), the urinary DMA excretion was high in the blue mussel and salmon groups, counting for 25% and 11% of the excreted tAs respectively. In conclusion our data indicate a possible formation of AB as a result of biotransformation of other organic arsenicals. The considerable amount of DMA excreted is probably not only due to methylation of ingested iAs, but due to biotransformation of organoarsenicals making it an inappropriate biomarker of iAs exposure in populations with a high seafood intake.

"Recently linear synchronous generator for the exploitation of sea wave energy has been proposed. That solution does not require reactive power to magnetize but needs permanent magnets to assure the excitation. The electrical energy generated by such a device must be converted and conditioned in order to match the instantaneous utility requirements and a power link from the sea to an interconnection is needed. In this paper in order to overcome that difficulty, the authors propose the use of the electrical energy generated to generate ""in situ"" hydrogen. As a result the output of the generation would be hydrogen that can be stored and used when needed The proposed electrical generator is a PM linear synchronous generator.",52
"On the basis of ab initio simulations, the value of strength of interatomic bonds in one-, two- and three-dimensional carbon crystals is obtained. It is shown that decreasing in dimensionality of crystal gives rise to nearly linear increase in strength of atomic bonds. It is ascertained that growth of strength of the crystal with a decrease in its dimensionality is due to both a reduction in coordination number of atom and increase in the angle between the directions of atomic bonds. Based on these data, it is substantiated that the one-dimensional (1D) crystals have maximum strength, and strength of carbyne is the absolute upper limit of strength of materials.",91
"Background: Sleep has been reported to be an important factor in bone metabolism, and sympathetic nervous system activity has been reported to regulate bone metabolism. In this study, we evaluated the association between sleep, sympathetic nervous system activity, and bone mass. Methods: The study subjects were 221 individuals (108 males; 113 females; mean age: 55.1 +/- 7.0 years) divided into two groups: those who slept for less than 6 h a day (short sleep [SS] group), and those who slept 6 h or longer (normal sleep [NS] group). The groups were compared with regard to lifestyle, cortical bone thickness, cancellous bone density, bone metabolism markers, blood leptin levels, and sympathetic nervous system activity as evaluated by heart rate variability analysis. Results: Significant differences were observed between the two groups in cortical bone thickness, blood TRACP-5b, and leptin levels. The L/H ratio (an index of sympathetic nervous system activity) was higher in the SS group than in the NS group. Significant negative correlations were observed between cortical bone thickness and both the L/H ratio and leptin levels, and a significant positive correlation was observed between the L/H ratio and leptin levels. Conclusions: Short sleep was associated with a decline in cortical bone thickness due to the promotion of bone resorption and sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity in the middle-aged group. Leptin levels and cortical bone thickness were found to be closely related, suggesting that cortical bone mass may be regulated via interaction with the leptin-sympathetic nervous system.

"Purpose Kyrieleis retinal periarteritis reflects the severe intraocular inflammation experienced by the eye. Its aetiology has not been well established, since only nine cases have been reported and there is no pathological study available in the literature. We determine the pathogenesis of Kyrieleis periarteritis based on interpretation of multimodal imaging findings. Methods Charts of patients with Kyrieleis arteritis seen between 2006 and 2014 were retrieved from eight uveitis referral centres throughout the world. Follow-up ranged from 5 to 12months. Results Twenty-five eyes with Kyrieleis arteritis from 25 patients were included in the study. Nineteen patients (72%) were male and six (28%) were female. Twenty-three patients were diagnosed with toxoplasmosis retinochoroiditis and two patients had cytomegalovirus retinitis. Fluorescein angiography, fundus autofluorescence and indocyanine green angiography were performed on 25/25 (100%) eyes. In eight eyes (32%), baseline spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) scans were performed along the segmental Kyrieleis arteritis. Fluorescein angiography showed early hypofluorescence and intermediate hyperfluorescence associated with the areas of focal arteritis, whereas indocyanine green angiography of these accumulations showed early hypofluorescence and late hyperfluorescence. Fundus autofluorescence revealed an increased autofluorescence of the vessels corresponding to the Kyrieleis plaques, while SD-OCT scans along the segmental Kyrieleis arteritis showed hyperreflectivity of the vessel wall. Conclusions These imaging modalities provide in vivo, quasi-histologic images demonstrating that Kyrieleis plaques are characterised by an inflammatory involvement within the vessels' endothelium.",33
"We study supply function competition among conventional power generators with different levels of flexibility and the impact of intermittent renewable power generation on the competition. Inflexible generators commit production before uncertainties are realized, whereas flexible generators can adjust their production after uncertainties are realized. Both types of generators compete in an electricity market by submitting supply functions to a system operator, who solves a two-stage stochastic program to determine the production level for each generator and the corresponding market prices. We aim to gain an understanding of how conventional generators' (in) flexibility and renewable energy's intermittency affect the supply function competition and the market price. We find that the classic supply function equilibrium model overestimates the intensity of the market competition, and even more so when more intermittent generation is introduced into the system. The policy of economically curtailing intermittent generation intensifies the market competition, reduces price volatility, and improves the system's overall efficiency. Furthermore, these benefits of economic curtailment are most significant when the production-based subsidies for renewable energy are absent.",43
"Background: Although metals can adversely impact children's health, the distribution of exposures to many metals, particularly among vulnerable subpopulations, is not well characterized. Objectives: We sought to determine whether neighborhood deprivation was associated with urinary concentrations of thirteen metals and whether observed relationships varied by race/ethnicity. Methods: We obtained neighborhood characteristics from the 2005-2009 American Community Survey. Demographic information and urine samples from 400 healthy young girls in Northern California were obtained during a clinical visit. Urine samples were analyzed for metals using inductively-coupled plasma-mass spectrometry and levels were corrected for creatinine. We ran analysis of variance and generalized linear regression models to estimate associations of urinary metal concentrations with neighborhood deprivation and race/ethnicity and stratified multivariable models to evaluate possible interactions among predictors on metals concentrations. Results: Urinary concentrations of three metals (barium, lead, antimony) varied significantly across neighborhood deprivation quartiles, and four (barium, lead, antimony, tin) varied across race/ethnicity groups. In models adjusted for family income and cotinine, both race/ethnicity (F-3,F-224 = 4.34, p = 0.01) and neighborhood deprivation (F-3,F-224 = 4.32, p = 0.01) were associated with antimony concentrations, but neither were associated with lead, barium, or tin, concentrations. Examining neighborhood deprivation within race/ethnicity groups, barium levels (p(interaction) < 0.01) decreased with neighborhood deprivation among Hispanic girls (p(trend) < 0.001) and lead levels (p(interaction) = 0.06) increased with neighborhood deprivation among Asian girls (p(trend) = 0.04). Conclusions: Our results indicate that children's vulnerability to some metals varies by neighborhood deprivation quartile and race/ethnicity. These differential distributions of exposures may contribute to environmental health disparities later in life. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",117
"The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is an example of a country that suffers from high water scarcity. Additionally, due to the economic drivers in the country, such as phosphate and potash extraction and pharmaceutical production, the little fresh water that remains is generally polluted. The infrastructure, often antiquated in urban areas and non-existent in rural areas, also contributes to poor water conditions and to the spread of waterborne diseases. This paper examines the socioeconomic factors that contribute to diarrhea and hepatitis A on a macro level in Jordan and discusses the public-policies that government officials could use to abate those problems. Ordinary least squares time series models are used to understand the macro-level variables that impact the incidence of these diseases in Jordan. Public health expenditure has a significant impact on reducing their incidence. Furthermore, investment in sanitation facilities in rural regions is likely to reduce the number of cases of hepatitis A. Perhaps the most surprising outcome is that importation of goods and services likely results in a decrease in cases of hepatitis A. However, income has little impact on the incidence of diarrhea and hepatitis A.",96
"Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of PEG/glycerides of different HLB; oleoyl macrogol-6-glycerides (Labrafil (R) M 1944 CS) and caprylocaproylmacrogol-8-glycerides (Labrasol (R)), compared to Labrafac lipophile (R) as PEG-free glyceride in the preparation of nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs). PEG/glycerides are suggested to perform a dual function; as the oily component, and as the PEG-containing substrate required for producing the PEGylated carriers without physical or chemical synthesis. Methods: Lipid nanocarriers were loaded with simvastatin (SV) as a promising anticancer drug. An optimization study of NLC fabrication variables was first conducted. The effect of lyophilization was investigated using cryoprotectants of various types and concentrations. The prepared NLCs were characterized in terms of particle size (PS), size distribution (PDI), zeta potential (ZP), drug entrapment, in vitro drug release, morphology and drug-excipient interactions. The influence of glyceridesPEG on the cytotoxicity of SV was evaluated on MCF-7 breast cancer cells, in addition to the cellular uptake of fluorescent blank NLCs. Results: The alteration between different oil types had a significant impact on PS, ZP and drug release. Both sucrose and trehalose showed the lowest increase in PS and PDI of the reconstituted lyophilized NLCs. The in vitro cytotoxicity and cellular uptake studies indicated that SV showed the highest antitumor effect on MCF-7 cancer cells when loaded into Labrasol (R) NLCs demonstrating a high cellular uptake as well. Conclusion: The study confirms the applicability of PEG/glycerides in the development of NLCs. Encapsulating SV in Labrasol (R)-containing NLC could enhance the antitumor effect of the drug.",14

"Objective: To investigate the association between subclinical hypothyroidism and preterm contractions. Methods: Prospective observational study among women at 23+0/7 and 34+6/7 weeks of gestation, with no known thyroid function abnormality, and preterm uterine contractions (PTC). All patients underwent laboratory evaluation of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) and Free Thyroxin (FT4). Patients with and without PTC were compared. Results: No association was found between PTC and subclinical hypothyroidism. Rate of spontaneous preterm delivery (PTD) was comparable between women with abnormal and normal thyroid function tests. Excluding indicated PTD, patients in the study group had a higher rate of spontaneous PTD (24.7% versus 9.6%, p = 0.03). Patients with past PTD and preterm contractions had higher rates of hypothyroxinemia compared with patients without past PTD (54.6% versus 19.0% and 31.2%, p = 0.001), and patients with past PTD (regardless of the presence or absence of PTC) had higher rate of subclinical hypothyroidism compared with patients with PTC and without PTD (59.1% and 66.7% versus 31.6%, p = 0.017). Conclusions: No association was found between PTC and subclinical hypothyroidism in the entire cohort, except for patients with preterm contractions and a history of past PTD. This specific group of patients might benefit from thyroid function evaluation.",133
"Background: Many people seek alternative treatments to reduce stress and to manage anxiety. To counsel people appropriately, physicians need to understand current evidence and recognize both the value and defects in the facts. Objective: To review the effect of Tai Chi interventions on improvement of mental health and to learn lessons from current evidence through various clinical studies. Methods: A literature search was performed to identify research studies that assessed Tai Chi's mental health benefits. Selected studies were classified according to research design, outcome measures, and results. They were qualitatively assessed based on Tai Chi's significant influence on mental health in the areas of mood, stress, and anxiety level. Results: After screening in citations that mentioned Tai Chi as an intervention, we found 21 clinical studies, all of which included at least one outcome measure of mental health or a testing system that included a mental health component. Our results show low evidence of recommending Tai Chi intervention to all patients who seek improvement in mental health despite that many positive effects of Tai Chi practice on mood and anxiety were found in different clinical trials. Conclusion: Considering the fact that Tai Chi is a gentle exercise, well suited for people with various physical capabilities, especially the elderly, health care providers may consider recommending it to people with mental health issues and seek alternative treatment besides routine medical care. Nonetheless, clinicians should be aware of the limitations due to incomplete understanding of Tai Chi as an intervention. Better evidence and stronger clinical trial designs are needed to further investigate Tai Chi's role in improving mental health.",29

"This paper presents an investment feasibility analysis of rainwater harvesting systems for the residential sector in Santa Catarina State, southern Brazil. Five towns were selected for the analysis. Daily rainfall data, average water consumption, rainwater tank costs, water pump costs, and water, sewage and electricity tariffs were obtained for the five towns. Different values for the roof area, number of residents, potable water demand, and rainwater demand were analysed. The rainwater tank capacities were estimated using the Netuno computer programme. The investment feasibility analysis was performed considering the ideal lower tank capacity, as well as capacities smaller and larger than the ideal. Such capacities were obtained according to a variation of six months in the payback period. It was observed that the ideal tank capacity can be conservative for high rainwater demands. In such cases, an investment feasibility analysis should be performed in order to obtain a more appropriate tank capacity. The main conclusion is that rainwater usage is economically feasible for most cases; and the higher the rainwater demand, the higher the feasibility.",95
"Luteinizing hormone (LH) rises dramatically during and after menopause, and has been correlated with an increased incidence of Alzheimer's disease and decreased memory performance in humans and animal models. To test whether LH acts directly on the dorsal hippocampus to affect memory, ovariectomized female rats were infused with either the LH-homologue human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or the LH receptor antagonist deglycosylated-hCG (dg-hCG). Infusion of hCG into either the lateral ventricle or the dorsal hippocampus caused significant memory impairments in ovariectomized estradiol-treated females. Consistent with this, infusion of the LH antagonist dg-hCG into the dorsal hippocampus caused an amelioration of memory deficits in ovariectomized females. Furthermore, the gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist Antide, failed to act in the hippo campus to affect memory. These findings demonstrate a significant role for LH action in the dorsal hippocampus in spatial memory dysfunction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",9
"Indoor scene classification is usually approached from a computer vision perspective. However, in some fields like robotics, additional constraints must be taken into account. Specifically, in systems with low resources, state-of-the-art techniques (CNNs) cannot be successfully deployed. In this paper, we try to close this gap between theoretical approaches and real world solutions by performing an in-depth study of the factors that influence classifiers performance, that is, size and descriptor quality. To this end, we perform a thorough evaluation of the visual and depth data obtained with an RGB-D sensor to propose techniques to build robust descriptors that can enable real-time indoor scene classification. Those descriptors are obtained by properly selecting and combining visual and depth information sources. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",0
"Background: Ribonuclease-L (RNase-L) was known to be a ubiquitous enzyme involved in several cellular functions, especially innate immunity. It was recently shown to participate in adipogenesis in rodents. Here, we developed a method to measure serum levels of RNase-L and analyzed the relationship between RNase-L and metabolic syndrome (MetS). Methods: A total of 396 subjects were recruited from a health check-up program. An in-house RNase-L immunoassay was developed. The serum RNase-L levels of these subjects were measured, and the association of MetS-related factors with RNase-L levels was assessed. Results: The mean serum level of RNase-L of the subjects with MetS were lower than those without (16.5 +/- 6.4 vs. 18.4 +/- 8.0 mu g/ml, P = 0.018). The subjects with central obesity, elevated blood pressure, or impaired fasting glucose also had lower serum RNase-L levels in comparison to those without. In multivariate linear regression analysis, diastolic blood pressure (beta = -0.129, P = 0.024) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (beta = 0.127, P = 0.036) were related to serum RNase-L. For every 5 mu g/ml increase in serum RNase-L levels, it is associated with a reduced risk of MetS (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71-0.98, P = 0.028), central obesity (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71-0.94, P = 0.005), or low HDL-C (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.74-1.00, P = 0.042). Moreover, age is inversely related to serum RNase-L levels in various analyses. Conclusions: The serum RNase-L levels were inversely associated with MetS, unfavorable metabolic profiles, and age.",130
"Cloud security has become one of the emergent issues because of the immense growth of cloud services. A major concern in cloud security is the insider threat because of the harm that it poses. Therefore, defending cloud systems against insider attacks has become a key demand. This work deals with insider threat in cloud relational database systems. It reveals the flaws in cloud computing that insiders may use to launch attacks and discusses how load balancing across availability zones may increase insider threat. To mitigate this kind of threat, the paper proposes four models, which are peer-to-peer model, centralized model, Mobile-Knowledgebases model, and Guided Mobile-Knowledgebases model, and it discusses their advantages as well as their limitations. Moreover, the paper provides experiments and analysis that compare among the proposed models, demonstrate their effectiveness, and show the conditions under which they work with highest performance.

"Thought-provoking experimental evidence suggests that perinatal light exposure may imprint circadian clocks with lasting effects on the alignment and the stability of circadian rhythms later in life. Assuming that exposure to light early in life could determine the stability of an individual's circadian system later in life, the present hypothesis proposes that time of year and location of birth (i.e., season and latitude) and thus differential Zeitgeber strengths may be key contributors to a person's susceptibility of developing mood disorders like seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and common internal cancers such as those of breast and prostate. Consequently, when and where people are born might critically predispose them to both mood disorders and internal cancers, and may affect the onset and course of such illnesses. This paper develops a causal framework and presents suggestions for rigorous tests of the associated corollary and predictions. It does not escape our attention that links between the perinatal Zeitgeber strength of light and its effects on the stability of circadian systems later in life could have a role to play in affecting long-term health beyond cancer and mood disorders mostly in adults but also in children.",71
"The oomycete Phytophthora capsici is a plant pathogen responsible for important losses to vegetable production worldwide. Its asexual reproduction plays an important role in the rapid propagation and spread of the disease in the field. A global proteomics study was conducted to compare two key asexual life stages of P. capsici, i.e. the mycelium and cysts, to identify stage-specific biochemical processes. A total of 1200 proteins was identified using qualitative and quantitative proteomics. The transcript abundance of some of the enriched proteins was also analysed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Seventy-three proteins exhibited different levels of abundance between the mycelium and cysts. The proteins enriched in the mycelium are mainly associated with glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (or citric acid) cycle and the pentose phosphate pathway, providing the energy required for the biosynthesis of cellular building blocks and hyphal growth. In contrast, the proteins that are predominant in cysts are essentially involved in fatty acid degradation, suggesting that the early infection stage of the pathogen relies primarily on fatty acid degradation for energy production. The data provide a better understanding of P. capsici biology and suggest potential metabolic targets at the two different developmental stages for disease control.",37
"Considerations of energy density, power, and calendar life are critical to effectively develop advanced secondary systems. For next generation battery applications requiring multiple features including long life, large cycle count, high energy density and high power, new strategies are needed for the rational design of electroactive materials and electrodes. This article discusses several conceptual approaches under exploration with examples from our research group. The first approach is the systematic synthesis of materials with structures facilitating ion insertion and deinsertion at high voltage and energy density, where we control materials properties such as surface area, particle size and in particular crystallite size. A second approach is the investigation of novel electrode structures and substrates to increase energy density and capacity retention under cycling, where we have developed strategies for minimizing passive components. A third approach is investigation of catalysts for metal air batteries where the cathode active material is drawn from the air rather than carried in the battery.

"This article provides an ecological framework for understanding adolescent-initiated parent abuse. We review research on adolescent-initiated parent abuse, identifying sociodemographic characteristics of perpetrators and victims (e.g., gender, age, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status [SES]). Bronfenbrenner's [1] ecological systems theory is applied, which examines the risk and protective factors for adolescent-initiated parent abuse within micro- (maltreatment, domestic violence, parenting behavior and disciplinary strategies), meso- (peer influence), exo- (media influence), macro- (gender role socialization), and chronosystem (change in family structure) levels. Findings from our review suggest that older and White children are significantly more likely to abuse their parents. Females are selective in the target of their aggression, while males target family members in general. Mothers are significantly more likely to be abused than fathers. However, researchers also report variations in the association between SES and parent abuse. Domestic violence and child maltreatment are risk factors, while findings on parenting behavior and disciplinary strategies are mixed. Peer influence, exposure to media violence, gender role socialization, and change in family structure can potentially increase the risk of parent abuse. Practice and research implications are also discussed. An ecological systems framework allows for an examination of how various contexts interact and influence parent abuse behavior, and can provide needed directions for further research.",74
"Background: The fungal genus Phlebia consists of a number of species that are significant in wood decay. Biotechnological potential of a few species for enzyme production and degradation of lignin and pollutants has been previously studied, when most of the species of this genus are unknown. Therefore, we carried out a wider study on biochemistry and systematics of Phlebia species. Methods: Isolates belonging to the genus Phlebia were subjected to four-gene sequence analysis in order to clarify their phylogenetic placement at species level and evolutionary relationships of the genus among phlebioid Polyporales. rRNA-encoding (5.8S, partial LSU) and two protein-encoding gene (gapdh, rpb2) sequences were adopted for the evolutionary analysis, and ITS sequences (ITS1 + 5.8S + ITS2) were aligned for in-depth species-level phylogeny. The 49 fungal isolates were cultivated on semi-solid milled spruce wood medium for 21 days in order to follow their production of extracellular lignocellulose-converting oxidoreductases and carbohydrate active enzymes. Results: Four-gene phylogenetic analysis confirmed the polyphyletic nature of the genus Phlebia. Ten species-level subgroups were formed, and their lignocellulose-converting enzyme activity profiles coincided with the phylogenetic grouping. The highest enzyme activities for lignin modification (manganese peroxidase activity) were obtained for Phlebia radiata group, which supports our previous studies on the enzymology and gene expression of this species on lignocellulosic substrates. Conclusions: Our study implies that there is a species-level connection of molecular systematics (genotype) to the efficiency in production of both lignocellulose-converting carbohydrate active enzymes and oxidoreductases (enzyme phenotype) on spruce wood. Thus, we may propose a similar phylogrouping approach for prediction of lignocellulose-converting enzyme phenotypes in new fungal species or genetically and biochemically less-studied isolates of the wood-decay Polyporales.",36
"We propose a novel approach for observing cosmic rays at ultra-high energy (>10(18) eV) by repurposing the existing network of smartphones as a ground detector array. Extensive air showers generated by cosmic rays produce muons and high-energy photons, which can be detected by the CMOS sensors of smartphone cameras. The small size and low efficiency of each sensor is compensated by the large number of active phones. We show that if user adoption targets are met, such a network will have significant observing power at the highest energies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2

"One challenge to HCV elimination through therapeutic intervention is reinfection. The aim of this analysis was to calculate the incidence of HCV reinfection among both HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals treated for recent HCV infection (estimated infection duration <18months). Individuals with recent HCV infection who achieved an end-of-treatment response in four open-label studies between 2004 and 2015 in Australia and New Zealand were assessed for HCV reinfection, confirmed by sequencing of the Core-E2 and/or NS5B regions. Reinfection incidence was calculated using person-time of observation. Exact Poisson regression analysis was used to assess factors associated with HCV reinfection. The cohort at risk for reinfection (n=120; 83% male; median age 36years) was composed of HIV-positive men-who-have-sex-with-men (53%) and people who inject drugs (current 49%, ever 69%). Total follow-up time at risk was 135 person-years (median 1.08years, range 0.17, 2.53). Ten cases of HCV reinfection were identified, for an incidence of 7.4 per 100 py (95% CI 4.0, 13.8). Reinfection incidence was significantly higher among participants who reported injection drug use at end of or post-treatment, irrespective of HIV status (15.5 per 100 py, 95% CI 7.8, 31.1). In adjusted analysis, factors associated with reinfection were older age (aIRR 5.3, 95% CI 1.15, 51.5, P=.042) and injection drug use at end of or post-treatment (aIRR 7.9, 95% CI 1.6, 77.2, P=.008). High reinfection incidence following treatment for recent HCV infection in individuals with ongoing risk behaviour emphasizes the need for post-treatment surveillance, harm reduction strategies and education in at-risk populations.",130
"Understanding temporal and spatial dimensions of land cover dynamics is a critical factor to link ecosystem transformation to land and environmental management. The trajectory of land cover change is not a simple difference between two conditions, but a continuous process. Therefore, there is a need to integrate multiple time periods to identify slow and rapid transformations over time. We mapped land cover composition and configuration changes using time series of Landsat TM/ETM+ images (1985-2011) in Southern Chile to understand the transformation process of a temperate rainforest relict and biodiversity hotspot. Our analysis builds on 28 Landsat scenes from 1985 to 2011 that have been classified using a random forests approach. Base on the high temporal data set we quantify land cover change and fragmentation indices to fully understand landscape transformation in this area. Our results show a high deforestation process for old growth forest strongest at the beginning of the study period (1985-1986-1998-1999) followed by a progressive slowdown until 2011. Within different study periods deforestation rates were much larger than the average rate over the complete study period (0.65%), with the highest annual deforestation rate of 1.2% in 1998-1999. The deforestation resulted in a low connectivity between native forest patches. Old-growth forest was less fragmented, but was concentrated mainly in two large regions (the Andes and Coastal mountain range) with almost no connection in between. Secondary forest located in more intensively used areas was highly fragmented. Exotic forest plantation areas, one of the most important economic activities in the area, increased sevenfold (from 12,836 to 103,540 ha), especially during the first periods at the expense of shrubland, secondary forest, grassland/arable land and old grown forest. Our analysis underlines the importance of expanding temporal resolution in land cover/use change studies to guide sustainable ecosystem management strategies as increase landscape connectivity and integrate landscape planning to economic activities. The study is highlighting the key role of remote sensing in the sustainable management of human influenced ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",94
"The availability of some sorts of biological samples which require noninvasive collection methods has led to an even greater interest in applying molecular biology on visceral leishmaniasis (VL) diagnosis, since these samples increase the safety and comfort of both patients and health professionals. In this context, this work aimed to evaluate the suitability of the urine as a specimen for Leishmania infantum kinetoplast DNA detection by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Subsequent to the reproducibility analysis, the detection limit of the qPCR assay was set at 5 fg (similar to 0.025 parasites) per mu L. of urine. From the comparative analysis performed with a set of diagnostic criteria (serological and molecular reference tests), concordance value of 96.08% was obtained (VL-suspected and HIV/AIDS patients, n = 51) (P>0.05). Kappa coefficient (95% CI) indicated a good agreement between the test and the set of diagnostic criteria (k = 0.778 +/- 0.151). The detection of Leishmania DNA in urine by qPCR was possible in untreated individuals, and in those with or without suggestive renal impairment. Fast depletion of the parasite's DNA in urine after treatment (from one dose of meglumine antimoniate) was suggested by negative qPCR results, thus indicating it as a potential alternative specimen to follow up the efficacy of therapeutic approaches. Even when evaluated in a clinically heterogeneous set of patients, the urine showed good prospect as sample for VL diagnosis by qPCR, also indicating a good negative predictive value for untreated suspected patients.

"Skin ageing is a complex biological process that is influenced by endogenous factors (30 %) and exogenous factors (70 %). Endogenous skin ageing is genetically determined, whereas exogenous skin ageing is mainly environmentally triggered - by exposure to sunlight, smoking, or a poor diet and can be prevented. Strategies against ageing skin focus on antioxidants, nutrition, and hormonal factors. Vitamins, carotenoids, vitamin E, flavonoids, or plant extracts are offered in the form of either topical preparations or food supplements. Their effect is in some cases due to temporary skin smoothing as a result of the accumulation of water and structural molecules in the upper layer of the dermis, and in other cases it is due to the effects of protection against sunlight. Furthermore, the skin is a suitable model for general research into ageing. Studies have shown that the skin thickness and bone density of menopausal women are strongly correlated. In-vitro experiments with human sebaceous glands have shown modified signalling cascades in the context of hormone-induced ageing. These relate to the expression of steroid hormones and cytokines, as well as the involvement of genes that have a role in the inflammation and pathogenesis of neurogenerative disorders.",114
"Dual assignment clustering (DAC) has been recently proposed in computer vision, shown to yield improved accuracy for action clustering tasks. The key idea of DAC is to consider another view (different from the original features) for the same set of samples, and to exploit the statistical correlation between cluster assignments in two views. However, the existing optimization is heuristic, mainly due to the difficulty in combinatorial optimization for hard cluster assignment. In this paper, we introduce a novel DAC optimization algorithm based on a probabilistic (soft) treatment, where the proposed objective function incorporates both the goodness of clustering in each view and the correlation between two views in a more principled and theoretically sound fashion. We also propose a lower-bound maximization technique that not only admits fast per-iteration solutions but also guarantees convergence to a local optimum. The superiority of the proposed approach to the existing methods is demonstrated for several activity video datasets. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",0
"Historical, environmental, and cultural contexts intersect with aging, sexuality, and gender across communities and generations. My scholarship investigates health and well-being over the life course across marginalized communities, including LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer) midlife and older adults, native communities experiencing cardiovascular risk, and families in China living with HIV, in order to balance the realities of unique lives in contemporary society. By probing the intersection of age, sexuality, and gender, my analysis is informed by both personal and professional experiences. With the death of my partner occurring at a time of profound invisibility and silence before HIV/AIDS, I found my life out of sync, experiencing a loss without a name. My life was thrust into a paradox: My relationship was defined by a world that refused to recognize it. This essay provides an opportunity for me to weave together how such critical turning points in my own life helped shape my approach to gerontology and how gerontology has informed my work and life. Reflecting on this journey, I illustrate the ways in which historical, structural, environmental, psychosocial, and biological factors affect equity, and the health-promoting and adverse pathways to health and well-being across marginalized communities. Although gerontology as a discipline has historically silenced the lives of marginalized older adults, it has much to learn from these communities. The growing and increasingly diverse older adult population provides us with unique opportunities to better understand both cultural variations and shared experiences in aging over the life course.",132
"Background: The psychological literature suggests that therapist perfectionism is common and potentially detrimental to client recovery. Little is known about the relationship between therapist perfectionism and client outcomes. Aims: This study aimed to measure perfectionism in High Intensity Cognitive Behavioural therapists, and establish any relationships between dimensions of therapist perfectionism, client outcomes and drop-out rates in treatment. Method: Thirty-six therapists took part in the study; levels of perfectionism were measured using a self-report questionnaire and these were analysed in relation to the clinical outcomes from a sample of their clients. Results: The results indicated that therapist perfectionism may be less common than previously suggested. Overall, a number of significant negative associations were observed between aspects of therapist perfectionism (e.g. having high standards for others), treatment efficacy and client retention in treatment. Conclusions: Therapist perfectionism is associated with CBT treatment outcomes; tentative recommendations for therapists managing their own schema as part of their clinical practice have been made, although further investigation is required.",69
"Patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) are prone to scar-related ventricular tachycardia (VT). The success of VT ablation depends on accurate arrhythmogenic substrate localization, followed by optimal delivery of energy provided by constant electrode-tissue contact. Current manual and remote magnetic navigation (RMN)-guided ablation strategies aim to identify a reentry circuit and to target a critical isthmus through activation and entrainment mapping during ongoing tachycardia. The MAGNETIC VT trial will assess if VT ablation using the Niobe (TM) ES magnetic navigation system results in superior outcomes compared to a manual approach in subjects with ischemic scar VT and low ejection fraction. This is a randomized, single-blind, prospective, multicenter post-market study. A total of 386 subjects (193 per group) will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 between treatment with the Niobe ES system and treatment via a manual procedure at up to 20 sites. The study population will consist of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ae35% and implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) who have sustained monomorphic VT. The primary study endpoint is freedom from any recurrence of VT through 12 months. The secondary endpoints are acute success; freedom from any VT at 1 year in a large-scar subpopulation; procedure-related major adverse events; and mortality rate through 12-month follow-up. Follow-up will consist of visits at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, all of which will include ICD interrogation. The MAGNETIC VT trial will help determine whether substrate-based ablation of VT with RMN has clinical advantages over manual catheter manipulation.",111
"Background: Doctors' verbal and non-verbal communication skills have an impact on patients' health outcomes, so it is important for medical students to develop these skills. Traditional, non-verbal communication skills training can involve a tutor manually annotating a student's non-verbal behaviour during patient-doctor consultations, but this is very time-consuming. Tele-conference systems have been used in verbal communication skills training. Methods: We describe EQClinic, a system that enables verbal and non-verbal communication skills training during tele-consultations with simulated patients (SPs), with evaluation exercises promoting reflection. Students and SPs can have tele-consultations through the tele-consultation component. In this component, SPs can provide feedback to students through a thumbs-up/thumbs-down tool and a comments box. EQClinic automatically analyses communication features in the recorded consultations, such as facial expressions, and provides graphical representations. Our 2015 pilot study investigated whether EQClinic helped students be aware of their non-verbal behaviour and improve their communication skills, and evaluated the usability of the platform. Students received automated feedback, and SP and tutor evaluations, and then completed self-assessment and reflection questionnaires. Results: Eight medical students and three SPs conducted 13 tele-consultations using EQClinic. More students paid attention to their non-verbal communication and students who were engaged in two consultations felt more confident in their second consultation. Students rated the system positively, felt comfortable using it (5.9/7), and reported that the structure (5.4/7) and information (5.8/7) were clear. This pilot provides evidence that EQClinic helps, and positively influences, medical students practise their communication skills with SPs using a tele-conference platform. Discussion: It is not easy to improve non-verbal communication skills in a short time period. Further evaluation of EQClinic with larger numbers will ascertain learning gains and application in health professional training. Developing a standard model for the assessment of non-verbal behaviour in tele-consultations and providing students with more valuable evaluation and suggestions are part of our future work.",64

"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, endogenous RNAs that regulate gene expression in both plants and animals. A large number of miRNAs has been identified from various animals and model plant species such as Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa); however, characteristics of wheat (Triticum aestivum) miRNAs are poorly understood. Here, computational identification of miRNAs from wheat EST sequences was preformed by using the in-house program GenomicSVM, a prediction model for miRNAs. This study resulted in the discovery of 79 miRNA candidates. Nine out of 22 miRNA representatives randomly selected from the 79 candidates were experimentally validated with Northern blotting, indicating that prediction accuracy is about 40%. For the 9 validated miRNAs, 59 wheat ESTs were predicted as their putative targets.",38
"ObjectiveDetermine whether the elimination of pain improves accuracy of clinical diagnostic criteria for adult chronic rhinosinusitis. Study DesignRetrospective cohort study. MethodsHistory, symptoms, nasal endoscopy, and computed tomography (CT) results were analyzed for 1,186 adults referred to an academic otolaryngology clinic with presumptive diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis. Clinical diagnosis was rendered using the 1997 Rhinosinusitis Taskforce (RSTF) Guidelines and a modified version eliminating facial pain, ear pain, dental pain, and headache. ResultsFour hundred seventy-nine subjects (40%) met inclusion criteria. Among subjects positive by RSTF guidelines, 45% lacked objective evidence of sinonasal inflammation by CT, 48% by endoscopy, and 34% by either modality. Applying modified RSTF diagnostic criteria, 39% lacked sinonasal inflammation by CT, 38% by endoscopy, and 24% by either modality. Using either abnormal CT or endoscopy as the reference standard, modified diagnostic criteria yielded a statistically significant increase in specificity from 37.1% to 65.1%, with a nonsignificant decrease in sensitivity from 79.2% to 70.3%. Analysis of comorbidities revealed temporomandibular joint disorder, chronic cervical pain, depression/anxiety, and psychiatric medication use to be negatively associated with objective inflammation on CT or endoscopy. ConclusionClinical diagnostic criteria overestimate the prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis. Removing facial pain, ear pain, dental pain, and headache increased specificity without a concordant loss in sensitivity. Given the high prevalence of sinusitis, improved clinical diagnostic criteria may assist primary care providers in more accurately predicting the presence of inflammation, thereby reducing inappropriate antibiotic use or delayed referral for evaluation of primary headache syndromes.

"The feeling of synchrony is fundamental for most social activities and prosocial behaviors. However, little is known about the behavioral correlates of this feeling and its modulation by intergroup differences. We previously showed that the subjective feeling of synchrony in subjects involved in a mirror imitation task was modulated by objective behavioral measures, as well as contextual factors such as task difficulty and duration of the task performance. In the present study, we extended our methodology to investigate possible interindividual differences. We hypothesized that being in a romantic relationship or being a professional musician can modulate both implicit and explicit synchronization and the feeling of synchrony as well as the ability to detect synchrony from a third person perspective. Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not find significant differences between people in a romantic relationship and control subjects. However, we observed differences between musicians and control subjects. For the implicit synchrony (spontaneous synchronization during walking), the results revealed that musicians that had never met before spontaneously synchronized their movements earlier among themselves than control subjects, but not better than people sharing a romantic relationship. Moreover, in explicit behavioral synchronization tasks (mirror game), musicians reported earlier feeling of synchrony and had less speed errors than control subjects. This was in interaction with tasks difficulty as these differences appeared only in tasks with intermediate difficulty. Finally, when subjects had to judge synchrony from a third person perspective, musicians had a better performance to identify if they were present or not in the videos. Taken together, our results suggest that being a professional musician can play a role in the feeling of synchrony and its underlying mechanisms.",65
"An effective way to learn computer programming is to sit side-by-side in front of the same computer with a tutor or peer, write code together, and then discuss what happens as the code executes. To bring this kind of in-person interaction to an online setting, we have developed Codechella, a multi-user Web-based program visualization system that enables multiple people to collaboratively write code together, explore an automatically-generated visualization of its execution state using multiple mouse cursors, and chat via an embedded text box. In nine months of live deployment on an educational website - www.pythontutor.com people from 296 cities across 40 countries participated in 299 Codechella sessions for both tutoring and collaborative learning. 57% of sessions connected participants from different cities, and 12 % from different countries. Participants actively engaged with the program visualizations while chatting, showed affective exchanges such as encouragement and banter, and indicated signs of learning at the lower three levels of Bloom's taxonomy: remembering, understanding, and applying knowledge.",40
"Many studies have explored the negative outcomes of childhood maltreatment, including psychopathology, risk-taking behaviors, and death by suicide. Being male may exacerbate negative symptoms following maltreatment and result in a decreased sense of psychological well-being. Much remains unexamined when exploring factors that may buffer the negative outcomes of maltreatment. Self-compassion has been suggested to aid in the improvement of psychological well-being and in the recovery of traumatic events. This study examined the relationship between self-compassion and psychological well-being among a sample of men who had and had not experienced childhood maltreatment. Testing a model of mediation, findings reflected that self-compassion, while not a full mediator between maltreatment and psychological well-being, served as partial mediator. Implications and future directions are explored.",76
"This research was performed to investigate the behavior of geosynthetic-reinforced sandy soil foundations and to study the effect of different parameters contributing to their performance using laboratory model tests. The parameters investigated in this study included top layer spacing, number of reinforcement layers, vertical spacing between layers, tensile modulus and type of geosynthetic reinforcement, embedment depth, and shape of footing. The effect of geosynthetic reinforcement on the vertical stress distribution in the sand and the strain distribution along the reinforcement were also investigated. The test results demonstrated the potential benefit of using geosynthetic-reinforced sand foundations. The test results also showed that the reinforcement configuration layout has a very significant effect on the behavior of reinforced sand foundation. With two or more layers of reinforcement, the settlement can be reduced by 2000 at all footing pressure levels. Sand reinforced by the composite of geogrid and geotextile performed better than those reinforced by geogrid or geotextile alone. The inclusion of reinforcement can redistribute the applied footing load to a more uniform pattern, hence reducing the stress concentration, which will result reduced settlement. Finally, the results of model tests were compared with the analytical solution developed by the authors in previous studies; and the analytical solution gave a good predication of the experimental results of footing on geosynthetic reinforced sand.

"A review of 92 heap leach projects from 15 countries provides a starting point for a series of experiments, at 22 degrees C and a vertical pressure of 2000 kPa, to examine short-term puncturing and the development of geomembrane strains that could affect longer-term performance. Underliners of gravel with some sand or those of gravel and sand caused significant puncturing and excessive strains in the geomembrane for the conditions examined. The shape of the underliner grading curve had a much greater effect on the potential for puncturing and the magnitude of the strains in the geomembrane than just the maximum particle size. Of the six granular underliners examined, the best performance was for the well graded gravelly sand with some silt which offered sufficient support to minimize the strains in the geomembrane due to the overliner while not inducing significant strains directly from the underliner. Nevertheless even in this case the maximum strain of 11% is almost double the maximum recommended in the literature for ensuring good long-term performance of the geomembrane. Consideration of composite liners with GCLs and compacted clay liners shows that the more deformable the foundation, the larger are the indentations and strains induced in the geomembrane by a given overliner. For the specific conditions examined, it is shown that there was no apparent improvement in performance for an LLDPE geomembrane versus the HDPE geomembrane tested. A 540 g/m(2) geotextile protection layer above the geomembrane was also found to be insufficient to prevent significant strains in the geomembrane due to the overliner examined.

"Here we present an overview of what is known about endogenous plant compounds that act as inhibitors of hormonal transport processes in plants, about their identity and mechanism of action. We have also summarized commonly and less commonly used compounds of non-plant origin and synthetic drugs that show at least partial 'specificity' to transport or transporters of particular phytohormones. Our main attention is focused on the inhibitors of auxin transport. The urgent need to understand precisely the molecular mechanism of action of these inhibitors is highlighted.",31
"Using 3-D technology computer aided design simulation, we investigated the impact of equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) on threshold voltage (V-TH) variation induced by work-function variation (WFV) in multigate devices. The WFV-induced VTH variation in multigate devices does not significantly vary with the dielectric constant of the gate dielectric material, but increases with decreasingphysicaloxide thickness(T-OX). As T-OX becomes thinner, electric field tends to be locally concentrated, causing a large variation of electrostatic potential in channel. The slope of the ratio of average grain size to gate area (RGG) plot is observed with various oxide thicknesses. It is confirmed that we can alleviate the WFV-induced VTH variation without significant performance degradation if gate dielectric layer becomes thicker with appropriately adopted higher-k engineering. In addition, the impact of EOT (including interface layer) on the WFV-induced VTH variation is studied.",82
"Context: Coordinating a software project across distances is challenging. Even without geographical and time zone distances, other distances within a project can cause communication gaps. For example, organisational and cognitive distances between product owners and development-near roles such as developers and testers can lead to differences in understanding and interpretation of the business requirements. Applying good software development practices, known to enhance alignment and coordination within development projects, can alleviate these challenges. Objective: The aim of our research is to identify and describe underlying factors which can explain why certain practices support aligning and coordinating software development projects. Method: We have inductively generated a theory analysing empirical data consisting of 15 interviews from 5 different companies. The systematic and iterative analysis was based on an initial hypothesis that distances affect development, and on results from previous research. Results: We present a theory of distances that explains how practices improve the communication within a project by impacting distances between people, activities and artefacts. We also present a theoretical model of how specific alignment practices affect different types of distances. Conclusions: The results provide a basis for further research and can be used by software organisations to improve on software practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",123
"1. Metabolism of ABT-107 was investigated in in vitro hepatic systems, in rat and monkey receiving [C-14] ABT-107, and in vivo plasma in rat, dog, monkey and human. 2. In in vitro hepatic systems, ABT-107 was primarily cleared via oxidative metabolism, and proceeded via two parallel pathways. Pathway 1, ABT-107 was oxidized at the nitrogen of quinuclidine moiety to form M1. Pathway 2, oxidation occurred at indole-containing moiety to form M2. Metabolism via N-oxidation was predominant in dog and rat, while in monkey and human, metabolism proceeded primarily via oxidation of indole-containing moiety. 3. ABT-107 was extensively metabolized in vivo in rat and monkey. M1 was primarily found in rat urine and bile; whereas, M2 was the major metabolite in monkey urine and feces. M1 was the predominant circulating metabolite in dog and rat. M2 was the primary circulating metabolite in monkey and human. 4. Enzymatic studies suggested M1 formation was primarily mediated by renal FMO1. CYP3A4, 1A2, 2J2 and 2D6 were primary enzymes catalyzing M2 formation. 5. Biotransformation of ABT-107 in human and monkey is markedly different from that in dog and rat, suggesting that monkey is an appropriate model for predicting human biotransformation and toxicology of ABT-107.",32
"The social difficulties of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are typically explained as a disruption in the Shared Attention Mechanism (SAM) sub-component of the theory of mind (ToM) system. In the current paper, we explore the hypothesis that SAM's capacity to construct the self-other-object relations necessary for shared-attention arises from a self-categorization process, which is weaker among those with more autistic-like traits. We present participants with self-categorization and shared-attention tasks, and measure their autism-spectrum quotient (AQ). Results reveal a negative relationship between AQ and shared-attention, via self-categorization, suggesting a role for self-categorization in the disruption in SAM seen in ASD. Implications for intervention, and for a ToM model in which weak central coherence plays a role are discussed.",113
"In order to get a thorough understanding of the total digital silicon micro-gyroscope, a novel system-level model with details of both the sense and circuit is presented in this paper. Unlike the traditional structures of the digital part of the digital gyroscope, a structure with programmable delay units (PDUs) instead of DPLLs gives a brief and robust character of the whole system. And the PDUs coordinating with the FIR filter could lead to a removal of the IF filters of the sigma delta DAC for feedback, which saves a lot of consumption. Two MASH sigma delta ADCs are designed to convert the output of the charge voltage converters to digital signals, which also bring a better stability. The ADCs achieve an SNR of 102.5 dB with a 10 kHz bandwidth. The stabilization of the closed drive mode has also been analyzed including how the noise caused by the quantization of the digital circuit is affecting the stabilization of both the amplitude and frequency of the driving signals. In the end, a final result of simulation of the gyroscope shows the correctness and accuracy of the whole model of the gyroscope.",48
"In this paper, we introduce Software Asset Analyzer (SAA), a system that monitors and detects potentially vulnerable software asset modifications in end devices, and can be used to guide patch management. Software patching is a complex and failure-prone process that, on enterprise networks, requires triage. Accurate inventories of software (applications and operating systems) improve patching efficiency, which is a significant concern for security analysts. By generating asset baselines, the SAA identifies and reports abnormal deviations in individual end-devices, which allows security analysts to identify vulnerable devices and further enforce security patching. This system is also suited for detecting vulnerable software installs and remediation process verification. SAA is a low-cost and efficient method that yields accurate and complete inventories of assets on end-devices, reducing the potential loss from new vulnerabilities.",68
"nomics, anthropology, ethics, and healthcare. The concept of value is deeply rooted in economic theory, dating back to the mid seventeenth century, and formally applied in 1776 by the Scottish economist Adam Smith in ""An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations"" [1]. As our economy has diversified from one based in commodities, revisions to the theory of value have come often. In our modem economy, value has been tied directly to the cost of an object (which can include the cost of its production, distribution, exchange and consumption). However, this strict economic definition of value has been refined, and in no sector is this more relevant than in healthcare. Value involves preferences (those of a patient or a consumer), a cost (financial risk or toxicity), an exchange (between individuals, or a tradeoff within an individual), and the context of such an exchange (in a patient with a terminal illness). And, as will be seen in this discussion, value, regardless of perspective, has political and societal implications. In this review, we aim to define value in gynecologic cancer care, to demonstrate the importance of value in the provision of this care, discuss how value impacts government relations and payors, and to provide examples of the intersection of value in the delivery of gynecologic cancer care.",8
"Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a unique disease entity with overlap components of both myelodysplastic syndrome and myeloproliferative neoplasms. CMML is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell neoplasm characterized by monocytosis, cytopenias, and extramedullary manifestations such as splenomegaly. The disease is rare and has undergone revisions in its classification. We review the recent classification strategies as well as diagnostic criteria, focusing on the new insights into the genetic alterations and unique pathophysiology of the disease. We also discuss the latest molecular characterization of the disease, including how molecular factors affect current prognostic models. Finally, we focus on available treatment strategies, with a special emphasis on experimental and forthcoming therapies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",20
"We propose a deterministic fluid model for the operation of two tandem SIP proxies in overload conditions. Using our model, we categorize overload scenarios into several classes, gaining better understanding of SIP overload. We then use the theory of Lyapunov for system stability and characterize stabilizing SIP overload control schemes over the state-space representation of a SIP server. A simple Lyapunov function is then utilized to build a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller for performing overload control in a tandem system of SIP servers. The proposed PID overload control algorithm is then evaluated using experiments showing it can successfully restore throughput close to maximum system capacity during overload. Furthermore, we study the effect of overload detection lag on system stability showing that even a small delay in reacting to overload can postpone system stabilization by multiple minutes.

"Ganoderma lucidum, a species of the Basidiomycetes class, has been attracting international attention owing to its wide variety of biological activities and great potential as an ingredient in skin care cosmetics including ""skin-whitening"" products. However, there is little information available on its inhibitory effect against tyrosinase activity. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to investigate the chemical composition of G. lucidum and its inhibitory effects on melanogenesis. We isolated the active compound from G. lucidum using ethanol extraction and ethyl acetate fractionation. In addition, we assayed its inhibitory effects on tyrosinase activity and melanin biosynthesis in B16F10 melanoma cells. In this study, we identified a bioactive compound, ganodermanondiol, which inhibits the activity and expression of cellular tyrosinase and the expression of tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TRP-1), TRP-2, and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), thereby decreasing melanin production. Furthermore, ganodermanondiol also affected the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent signaling pathway, which are involved in the melanogenesis of B16F10 melanoma cells. The finding that ganodermanondiol from G. lucidum exerts an inhibitory effect on tyrosinase will contribute to the use of this mushroom in the preparation of skin care products in the future.",114
"We evaluated the correlation of educational attainment with structural volume and shape morphometry of the bilateral hippocampi and amygdalae in a sample of 110 non-demented, older adults at elevated sociodemographic risk for cognitive and functional declines. In both men and women, no significant education-volume correlation was detected for either structure. However, when performing shape analysis, we observed regionally specific associations with education after adjusting for age, intracranial volume, and race. By sub-dividing the hippocampus and the amygdala into compatible subregions, we found that education was positively associated with size variations in the CA1 and subiculum subregions of the hippocampus and the basolateral subregion of the amygdala (p < 0.05). In addition, we detected a greater left versus right asymmetric pattern in the shape-education correlation for the hippocampus but not the amygdala. This asymmetric association was largely observed in men versus women. These findings suggest that education in youth may exert direct and indirect influences on brain reserve in regions that are most vulnerable to the neuropathologies of aging, dementia, and specifically, Alzheimer disease.",106
"Multi-Attribute Value Theory (MAVT) was used to investigate stakeholders' preferences and beliefs in ameliorating a deteriora ting ecosystem, i.e. Vosvozis River and Ismarida Lake in Northeastern Greece. Various monetary and environmental criteria were evaluated with scores and weights by different stakeholder groups and key individuals such as farmers, fishermen, entrepreneurs, residents and ecologists to elicit their preferences concerning alternative protection scenarios. The ultimate objective was to propose policy recommendations for a sustainable water resources management for the case study area. The analysis revealed an overwhelming agreement among stakeholders regarding the dire need for immediate actions in order to preserve and enhance Vosvozis ecosystem. With a two stage evaluation process, the MAVT analysis led to a high consensus among the stakeholders on the alternative that favors water recycling from the wastewater treatment plant combined with small dams for rainwater harvesting.

"Background: Heart rate variability is reduced in idiopathic PD, indicating cardiac autonomic dysfunction likely resulting from peripheral autonomic synucleinopathy. Little is known about heart rate variability in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2-associated PD. Objectives: This study investigated heart rate variability in LRRK2-associated PD. Methods: Resting electrocardiograms were obtained from 20 individuals with LRRK2-associated PD, 37 nonmanifesting carriers, 48 related noncarriers, 26 idiopathic PD patients, and 32 controls. Linear regression modelling compared time and frequency domain values, adjusting for age, sex, heart rate, and disease duration. Results: Low-frequency power and the ratio of low-high frequency power were reduced in idiopathic PD versus controls (P <. 008, P <. 029 respectively). In contrast, individuals with LRRK2-associated PD were not statistically different from controls in any parameter measured. Furthermore, all parameters trended toward being higher in LRRK2-associated PD when compared with idiopathic PD. Conclusions: Heart rate variability may remain intact in LRRK2-associated PD, adding to a growing literature supporting clinical-pathologic differences between LRRK2-associated and idiopathic PD.

"In this article we investigate if the Swedish consumer prices for electricity are adjusted equally fast regardless of whether the NordPool power market prices are decreased or increased. Due to relatively moderate variations in the variables, we have applied quantile regression, since it is mainly the large changes (above the median) that essentially tend to have a considerable effect on the consumer prices. Moreover, in order to adjust for stochastic- and deterministic trends, autocorrelation, structural breaks as well as to measure APT effects in the short- and in the medium-run, we apply a wavelet decomposition approach. Our results show evidence that significantly positive asymmetric price transmission (APT) effects exist in this market. More specifically, in the short-run (based on the wavelet decomposition D1 for 1-2 months cycles), we find that that there is a higher propensity to rapidly and systematically increase the consumer prices subsequently to an increase in the NordPool market price, compared with the propensity to decrease their customers prices subsequently to a corresponding drop in the NordPool market prices. However, no significant APT effects were detected in the medium- or in the long-run (i.e. the asymmetric price transmission effects are observed only in the short-run). In summary, we could isolate significant APT effects in the short-run (1-2 months decomposition cycles), and for large changes in the dependent variable (percentiles = 0.9). Therefore, only large changes in the NordPool prices lead to feedback effects in the form of asymmetric price transmission effects. Our evidence supports the notion of firms' downward stickiness of retail prices for maximizing profit, which are not expected to be found on a fully efficient market. Although our finding shows that the price inefficiency is short-lived, these large temporal inefficiencies are still costly for the consumers. It should be noted that blunt traditional powerless methods do not detect these APT effects, while our wavelet quantile methods are powerful and make a significant contribution in the literature by providing new empirical evidence.",43
"Probabilistic inference over large data sets is a challenging data management problem since exact inference is generally #P-hard and is most often solved approximately with sampling-based methods today. This paper proposes an alternative approach for approximate evaluation of conjunctive queries with standard relational databases: In our approach, every query is evaluated entirely in the database engine by evaluating a fixed number of query plans, each providing an upper bound on the true probability, then taking their minimum. We provide an algorithm that takes into account important schema information to enumerate only the minimal necessary plans among all possible plans. Importantly, this algorithm is a strict generalization of all known PTIME self-join-free conjunctive queries: A query is in PTIME if and only if our algorithm returns one single plan. Furthermore, our approach is a generalization of a family of efficient ranking methods from graphs to hypergraphs. We also adapt three relational query optimization techniques to evaluate all necessary plans very fast. We give a detailed experimental evaluation of our approach and, in the process, provide a new way of thinking about the value of probabilistic methods over non-probabilistic methods for ranking query answers. We also note that the techniques developed in this paper apply immediately to lifted inference from statistical relational models since lifted inference corresponds to PTIME plans in probabilistic databases.",112
"A number of previous studies have reported a potential risk of malignancy, particularly hematological malignancy, developing in patients receiving a metal-on-metal (MoM) hip replacement. We report a case of malignant lymphoma that arose in a patient who had an MoM hip arthroplasty complicated by development of a pseudotumour. The tumour was a B cell follicular lymphoma that involved lymph nodes and bone. Metal ions are known to have a genotoxic effect on lymphoid cells. Although epidemiological studies have not established that there is an increased risk of lymphoma associated with MoM implants, only a relatively short time period has elapsed since re-introduction of this type of implant and long-term follow-up of patients with MoM implants is indicated.",7
"Switched systems theory is used to analyze the stability of image-based observers for three-dimensional localization of objects in a scene in the presence of intermittent measurements due to occlusions, feature tracking losses, or a limited camera field of view, for example. Generally, observers or filters that are exponentially stable under persistent measurement availability may have unbounded error growth under intermittent measurement loss, even while providing seemingly accurate state estimates. By constructing a framework that utilizes a state predictor during periods when measurements are not available, a class of image-based observers is shown to be exponentially convergent in the presence of intermittent measurements if an average dwell time, and a total unmeasurability time, condition is satisfied. The conditions are developed in a general form, applicable to any observer that is exponentially convergent assuming persistent visibility, and utilizes object motion knowledge to reduce the amount of time measurements must be available to maintain convergence guarantees. Based on the stability results, simulations are provided to show improved performance compared to a zero-order hold approach, where state estimates are held constant when measurements are not available. Experimental results are also included to verify the theoretical results, to demonstrate applicability of the developed observer and predictor design, and to compare against a typical approach using an extended Kalman filter.",0
"Background: The purpose of this study is to investigate the most suitable first-line approach and the best combination treatment for primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMLBCL) as they have been matter of debate for at least two decades. Methods: Our single centre experience in the treatment of 98 de novo PMLBCL patients over the last 20 years is reviewed. All patients received MACOP-B chemotherapy. Thirty-seven received both rituximab and mediastinal radiotherapy; 30 were irradiated after chemotherapy, although not receiving rituximab and 20 received rituximab without radiotherapy consolidation. Eleven patients received chemotherapy only. Results: Sixty-one (62.2%) patients achieved a complete response after MACOP-B (with or without rituximab); among the 27 (27.6%) partial responders, 21 obtained a complete response after radiotherapy. At the end of their scheduled treatment, 82 patients (83.7%) had a complete and 6 a partial response (6.1%). Eleven patients relapsed within the first 2 years of follow-up. The 17-year overall survival is 72.0% (15 patients died); progression-free and disease-free survival are 67.6% and 88.4%, respectively. A statistically significant difference in overall and progression-free survival was noted among treatment groups, although no disease-free survival difference was documented. Conclusions: Our data indicate that a third-generation regimen like MACOP-B could be considered a suitable first-line treatment. Mediastinal consolidation radiotherapy impacts on survival and complete response rates and remains a good strategy to convert partial into complete responses. Data suggest that radiotherapy may be avoided in patients obtaining a complete response after (immuno) chemotherapy, but this requires confirmation with further ad hoc studies.",7
"There is conflicting evidence about the contribution of maternal depression and family adversity to depression experienced by offspring. Because maternal depression and family adversity are related, there is a need to determine how they independently contribute to offspring depression. Data are from a long running prospective birth cohort study (Mater-University of Queensland Study of Pregnancy and its outcomes MUSP). For this study some 2200 offspring were followed up at 30 years of age. We first examine the association between maternal depression and family adversity over the period from the pregnancy to the child reaching adulthood. Then we consider the extent to which maternal depression and family adversity trajectories over this period predict CIDI/DSM-IV episodes of depression in the offspring of these mothers at 30 years of age. We find a strong bi-directional association between maternal depression and family experiences of adverse life events over the entire period the child is at home. After adjustment, children reared in a family experiencing high levels of adverse life events are more likely to experience a lifetime ever DSM-IV diagnosis of depression, are more likely to have experienced multiple episodes of lifetime ever depression, and are more likely to report their first episode of depression was at a younger age. The findings suggest the association between maternal depression and offspring depression appears to be partly attributable to the higher levels of family adversity characteristic of depressed mothers.

"Background: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is relentless progressive interstitial lung disease. Evaluating predictor of mortality for IPF patients is crucial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the serial trend of important indicators of prognosis and create a useful staging method for IPF patients. Methods: We retrospectively searched medical records, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and chest high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans from January 1, 2008 through June 30, 2015 at our hospital. We also evaluated the same parameters 1-year later. Results: We identified 65 IPF patients. The mean age was 71.9 +/- 1.8 years (range, 22-85 years). In terms of PFTs, mean percent predicted forced vital capacity (%FVC) was 69.8 +/- 2.7. Baseline mean body mass index (BMI) was 24.3 +/- 0.6 kg/mm(2). Mean survival was 39.2 months (range, 0.9-158.9 months). Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) showed the following to be predictors of mortality in IPF patients: 1-year BMI (HR: 0.899; 95% CI: 0.825-0.979; P=0.021); 1-year % FVC (HR: 0.932; 95% CI: 0.887-0.979; P=0.005) and 1-year respiratory hospitalization (HR: 3.307; 95% CI: 2.149-5.090; P<0.001). On the basis of these date, we created a new staging method for predicting mortality for IPF patients, consisting of delta BMI, delta % FVC and respiratory hospitalization within a year following diagnosis of IPF (BFR staging). We stratified patients into one of three groups according to the composite points. Mean survival of stages 1, 2, and 3 was 77.9 (30.8-158.9), 43.9 (0.9-145.2) and 14.8 (3.5-32) months (P<0.001), respectively. Conclusions: In our cohort of IPF patients, this new staging method, including delta BMI and delta % FVC and respiratory hospitalization within 1-year showed a clear survival difference.",3
"Background/aim: Narrowband UVB (Nb UVB) treatment is commonly used for the management of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, and is less often used for vitiligo in children. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and short-term safety of Nb UVB phototherapy in children diagnosed with vitiligo retrospectively Materials and methods: A total of 26 patients younger than 18 years with the diagnosis of vitiligo and managed with Nb UVB phototherapy as documented in archive records were evaluated. Clinical response was assessed according to repigmentation of the lesions: good response when there was more than 75% repigmentation, moderate response when there was 25%-74% repigmentation, poor response when repigmentation was less than 24%, and unresponsive when there was no pigmentation and new lesions occurred. Results: A total of 26 patients received Nb UVB treatment; 14 were girls and 12 were boys. The age at onset of the disease varied between 2 and 18 years, with a mean age of onset of 10.07 +/- 4.53 years. Repigmentation rate of >75% was detected in 45.4% of cases. Conclusion: Nb UVB phototherapy seems to be a well-tolerated effective and safe treatment option in children, especially those unresponsive to topical treatment and those with widespread lesions. However, long-term risks such as photocarcinogenesis and photoaging should kept in mind.",110
"We present an iterative algorithm, called the symmetric tensor eigen-rank-one iterative decomposition (STEROID), for decomposing a symmetric tensor into a real linear combination of symmetric rank-1 unit-norm outer factors using only eigendecompositions and least-squares fitting. Originally designed for a symmetric tensor with an order being a power of two, STEROID is shown to be applicable to any order through an innovative tensor embedding technique. Numerical examples demonstrate the high efficiency and accuracy of the proposed scheme even for large scale problems. Furthermore, we show how STEROID readily solves a problem in nonlinear block-structured system identification and nonlinear state-space identification. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",49
"Root system analysis is a complex task, often performed with fully automated image analysis pipelines. However, the outcome is rarely verified by ground-truth data, which might lead to underestimated biases. We have used a root model, ArchiSimple, to create a large and diverse library of ground-truth root system images (10,000). For each image, three levels of noise were created. This library was used to evaluate the accuracy and usefulness of several image descriptors classically used in root image analysis softwares. Our analysis highlighted that the accuracy of the different traits is strongly dependent on the quality of the images and the type, size, and complexity of the root systems analyzed. Our study also demonstrated that machine learning algorithms can be trained on a synthetic library to improve the estimation of several root system traits. Overall, our analysis is a call to caution when using automatic root image analysis tools. If a thorough calibration is not performed on the dataset of interest, unexpected errors might arise, especially for large and complex root images. To facilitate such calibration, both the image library and the different codes used in the study have been made available to the community.",1
"Non-point source water pollution mainly comes from farmland chemical fertilizers which has become an obstacle of agricultural sustainability and ecological health. As a public policy tool for assessing global ecological crisis and environmental pollution, ecological compensation is important for regional agricultural sustainability. Ecological compensation that farmers receive from governments is based on their reduction of fertilizer application at optimal ecological and economic levels. In this study we estimated the ecological compensation standards for nitrogen non-point pollution in Yixng city with contingent valuation method and cost-benefit method. Results showed that the range of theoretical values of ecological compensation of nitrogen in Yixing City depended upon its optimal ecological and economic nitrogen application levels. The willingness of farmers to accept the compensation was positively correlated with their farming experience and education. There were about half of farmers willing to accept the compensation. Based on the present study, we found Yixing's ecological compensation standard for controlling nitrogen non-point pollution was 620.0 yuan/hm(2) at the current economic development level.",96
"Developmental Dyslexia (DD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting reading acquisition. DD cannot be diagnosed before starting the primary school; thereby, one of the main challenges is to obtain an early DD identification even during preschool years. Achieving this goal could help children at risk for DD to limit the impact of this disorder. To this aim, we have created a digital system composed of various serious games designed for predicting the risk of DD in preschoolers and potentially training specific skills impaired in this learning disability. Our set of serious games are designed to be accessible from any device, a computer with mouse and keyboard, but also a tablet with touch interface for younger children.",80
"Vaccination has saved more lives than any other medical procedure. Pathogens have now evolved that have not succumbed to vaccination using the empirical paradigms pioneered by Pasteur and Jenner. Vaccine design strategies that are based on a mechanistic understanding of the pertinent immunology and virology are required to confront and eliminate these scourges. In this perspective, we describe just a few examples of work aimed to achieve this goal by bringing together approaches from statistical physics with biology and clinical research.",33
"Testosterone deficiency in adult age is associated with a decrease in libido, energy, hematocrit, muscle mass and bone mineral density, as well as with depression. More recently, testosterone deficiency has also been associated with various components of the metabolic syndrome, which in turn is associated with a five-fold increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease. Low testosterone levels are associated with increased insulin resistance, increase in fat mass, low HDL cholesterol, higher triglyceride levels and hypertension. Testosterone replacement therapy in patients with testosterone deficiency and type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or metabolic syndrome has shown reductions in insulin resistance, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and improvement in glycemic control and anthropometric parameters.

"This paper explores the proposal that there is a close link between counterfactual thinking and lying. Both require the imagination of alternatives to reality and we describe four studies which explore this link. In Study 1 we measured individual differences in both abilities and found that individuals with a tendency to generate counterfactual thoughts were also more likely to generate potential lies. Studies 2 and 3 showed that counterfactual availability influences people's ability to come up with lies and the extent to which they expect others to lie. Study 4 used a behaviotiral measure of deception to show that people tend to lie more in situations also known to elicit counterfactual thoughts. Overall, the results show that the imagination of alternatives to the past plays an important role in the generation of lies. We discuss the implications for the fields of counterfactual thinking and deception. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",62
"Disruptive behaviour disorders comprise the diagnosis conduct disorder (CD) and in adults the diagnosis antisocial personality disorder (APD). CD is seen as a difficult-to-treat disorder with a high risk for persistent behavioral problems. In addition, CD is seen as the precursor to antisocial personality disorder (Kretschmer et al., 2014). Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) was originally developed by Marsha Linehan (1991) for the treatment of borderline personality disorder, but because of the core deficits in emotion regulation in disruptive behavior disorders, DBT is also increasingly being recommended for the treatment of CD and APD. This review presents DBT adaptions for the forensic setting and for the treatment of CD/APD. Clinical implications are discussed.",70
"Background: Little is known about the course of depression in midlife women. This study aims to identify factors that distinguish risk factors for persistent or recurrent depression from those of a milder course across 13-years of follow-up. Methods: 297 Black and White premenopausal women aged 42-52 were enrolled at the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation Pittsburgh site. Psychiatric interviews obtained information on lifetime psychiatric diagnoses at baseline and occurrences of depression annually. We identified four depression patterns: 91(31%) had Persistent/recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD), 27(9%) Single Episode MDD, 35 (12%) Minor Depression (minD) only, 144(48%) No Depression. We compared baseline risk factors for the Persistent/recurrent MDD group with each of the other three. Results: A lifetime history of major or minor depression (p-values =.001-.08) and 2+ very upsetting life events in the previous year (p-values=.003-.04) were more likely to be reported by women in the Persistent/recurrent group than in the other three. The Persistent/recurrent group was more likely to report a family history of depression (p=.03) than the MinD group, and to report current sleep problems (p=.002) at baseline than the Single Episode MDD group. Limitations: Small numbers of women with minD or a Single Episode MDD. Childhood maltreatment and family depression history were retrospectively reported. Conclusions: A Persistent/recurrent depression course is common during midlife. In addition to personal and family histories of depression, providers of midlife health care should recognize that current sleep problems and recent very upsetting events are strong risk factors for a pernicious depression course.

"Background: Youths in universities are at high risk of STIs and SRH problems in Ethiopia. However, students did not perceive themselves at risk of STI/HIV infection though reports showed they were sexually active, had multiple sexual partners and reported symptoms of STIs. Having recognized the threat posed by SRH problems, this study aimed to assess the SRH experiences, knowledge, and problems among university students at Ambo University in Ethiopia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Ambo University main campus from January to February 2015 using mixed approach of quantitative (survey) and qualitative (in-depth interview) methods. Proportionate stratified sampling technique was used to select 400 survey respondents and purposive sampling was employed to identify 10 in-depth interviewees. The quantitative data was coded, entered to SPSS and descriptively analyzed, while the qualitative data was categorically organized, repeatedly reviewed and thematically analyzed. Results: Mean age during first sex of 17.29 +/- SD 2.21 and mean number of past 12 months regular sexual partners of 1.36 +/- SD 0.505 were recorded. Only 21.1% of survey respondents perceived themselves to be at risk of HIV. Almost all survey respondents ever heard of STIs (94.5%) and HIV/AIDS (98%), and 89.4% knew modern contraceptives such as pills (64.8%) and condoms (56.8%). Despite awareness of STIs including HIV/AIDS, more than one fifth (22.8%) had any of the STIs in the past one year. Although the quantitative data showed unwanted pregnancy (5%) and abortion (2.5%) existed in the campus minimally, high rates of unwanted pregnancy and unsafe abortion were reported in the qualitative data. Conclusions: SRH/STIs were problems among students of the university. Although students knew about STIs, the STI infection rate in the past year was quite high, and was almost as high as the percentage of students who reported sexual activity in the past year. Though reported by a minority of students, unwanted pregnancy and unsafe abortion may also be a problem. The university thus needs to launch a program directed towards STIs and SRH problems, particularly among female students.",132
"In this paper we proposes a synthesis of different mathematical models of power electronic converters based on Thevenin/Norton equivalent circuits. Those models, composed by impedances and harmonic noise sources, are helpful to predict the conducted ElectroMagnetic Interferences (EMI) generated by converters connected to the electrical network. Moreover, the extracted impedances contribute to improve EMI filters, since they are considered as the filter's load (upstream and downstream filter's sides). The analytical model is tested with PSpice simulations and validated by experimental measurements, from DC frequency until 30MHz.",50
"The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are drugs used in clinical practice since 2009 for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism in non-valvular atrial fibrillation, and for the treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism. The four DOACs, including the three factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban) and one direct thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran) provide oral anticoagulation therapy alternatives to Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Despite their clear advantages, the DOACs require on the part of the internist a thorough knowledge of their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics to ensure their correct use, laboratory monitoring and the appropriate management of adverse events. This document represents a consensus paper on the use of DOACs by representatives of three Italian scientific societies: the Italian Society of Internal Medicine (SIMI), the Federation of the Associations of Hospital Managers (FADOI), and the Society for the Study of Haemostasis and Thrombosis (SISET). This document formulates expert opinion guidance for pragmatic managing, monitoring and reversing the anticoagulant effect of DOACs in both chronic and emergency settings. This practical guidance may help the internist to create adequate protocols for patients hospitalized ion internal medicine wards, where patients are often elderly subjects affected by poly-morbidities and renal insufficiency, and, thus, require particular attention to drug-drug interactions and peri-procedural protocols.",111
"Introduction: According to WHO, the primary infertility in India is about 3.9% (age-standardized to 25-49 year) and 16.8% (age-standardized to 15-49 year), using the ""age but no birth"" definition. Several factors which affect fertility include low sperm production in men, poor egg quality and blocked fallopian tubes in women and also hormonal imbalances. Leptin plays a critical role in women's reproduction and neuroendocrine health. It is used for treating exercise-induced bone loss, eating disorders and infertility. Aim: To evaluate the serum leptin levels in Indians and to ascertain the relationship between serum leptin levels, Unexplained Infertility (UI) and related variables [ height, weight, Waist Hip Ratio (WHR), Body Mass Index (BMI)] between obese infertile, non-obese infertile and healthy subjects. Materials and Methods: The present case-control study was conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, King George's Medical University (KGMU), Lucknow, India and funded by Department of Science and Technology, New Delhi, India. The study included 229 female participants in the age group of 18-40 years (120 cases and 109 controls) who were randomly selected. The blood samples were collected from the Infertility Clinic, Queen Mary's Hospital, KGMU, Lucknow, India. All the participants underwent complete physical examination. Initially, the participants were categorized into fertile and infertile groups, they were further divided on the basis of BMI, normal (BMI-18.5-24.5) and overweight or obese (BMI >= 25). Leptin level was measured by Active Human Leptin ELISA kit and BMI of all subjects was calculated in kg/m(2) (weight in kg and height in m). Results: A highly positive linear correlation (R=0.754, p<0.001) was found between BMI and serum leptin in unexplained infertile women, which indicates a strong relationship between BMI and serum leptin. The variation in serum leptin is explained by the independent variable, BMI. There was a partial positive linear correlation between BMI and serum leptin in the control group. Statistically there was no significant correlation (R=0.109, p=0.258) between BMI and serum leptin in the control group. Conclusion: The present study clearly demonstrates that level of leptin is higher in unexplained infertile than in the fertile group, and also shows that a strong relationship exists between BMI and serum leptin in the obese group. Serum leptin level was significantly higher in obese than non-obese subjects. Thus, leptin is an important factor for normal reproductive function. Obesity, the main cause of infertility may be controlled by regulating the leptin concentration.",67
"Service providers have often used the mantra of ""service with a smile"" as a strategy to engender customer satisfaction. The findings of the current research indicate that a smile alone may not be sufficient in achieving service excellence. Specifically, this work extends prior research suggesting that customers have more positive reactions to Duchenne, or authentic, smiles compared to non-Duchenne, or non genuine, smiles. Two experimental vignette studies examined the influence of the type of smile a service provider displays (Duchenne vs. non-Duchenne) and gender of the service provider on perceptions of service quality, as well as the Stereotype Content Model dimensions of competence and warmth. The results suggest that the type of smile (Duchenne vs. non-Duchenne) impacts evaluations of service providers in terms of their perceived level of competence, as well as their perceived service quality ratings. Implications for the hiring and training of service providers are also discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",64
"This paper introduces a novel backward/forward sweep algorithm for both fundamental and harmonics flow calculation in distribution network. In this algorithm, the fundamental and harmonic currents of each branch are calculated by equivalent current injection method. The relationship between branch currents and harmonic currents of each order on a radial feeder can be calculated by summing the injection current from the receiving end toward the sending end of the feeder. After obtaining the branch currents, both the harmonics bus voltage and the fundamental bus voltage can be easily obtained from the sending end to the receiving end based on the Kirchhoff's Voltage Law. By using this method, the LU decomposition is avoided and it will save huge computational time. Base on special hierarchy characteristic of radial network, the branches are sorted by layers. So that the branch power loss and voltage drop can be computed in parallel at each level. The computational time can be further reduced. The test results demonstrate the flexible, accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.",47
"In addition to its role in vision, light exerts strong effects on behavior. Its powerful role in the modulation of mood is well established, yet remains poorly understood. Much research has focused on the effects of light on circadian rhythms and subsequent interaction with alertness and depression. The recent discovery of a third photoreceptor, melanopsin. expressed in a subset of retinal ganglion cells, allows major improvement of our understanding of how photic information is processed. Light affects behavior in two ways, either indirectly through the circadian timing system, or directly through mechanisms that are independent of the circadian system. These latter effects have barely been studied in regard to mood, but recent investigations on the direct effects of light on sleep and alertness suggest additional pathways through which light could influence mood. Based on our recent findings, we suggest that light, via melanopsin, may exert its antidepressant effect through a modulation of the homeostatic process of sleep. Further research is needed to understand how these mechanisms interplay and how they contribute to the photic regulation of mood. Such research could improve therapeutic management of affective disorders and influence the management of societal lighting conditions. (c) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",71
"Following the recent global climate changes, many countries, including developed nations, are announcing greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets and are actively participating in reducing GHG. Therefore, the role of the building sector on reducing GHG is being emphasized, and the establishment of policy structures for both making environmentally friendly capacity compulsory and improving the housing quality is being demanded. South Korea is also developing a policy for improving housing quality, but in order to achieve more competitive growth, this must be preceded by an analysis of current policy status within various countries on improving housing quality. This study aims to suggest direction about policies that will improve the housing quality in South Korea. For this, the policies of major countries were able to categorize and compare according to three major categories (performance, function, and aesthetics), and seven factors (safety, durability, cost and maintenance, response to residents' needs, habitability, energy saving, and building design) regarding housing quality. As a result, from the performance aspect, policy directions were suggested for safe housing, the urban environment, regeneration of quality stock, and the usage of existing stock; from the functional aspect, policies for improving housing quality that responds to the aging population and energy saving housing were suggested; from the aesthetic aspect, housing designs that consider the urban environment were suggested.",99
"This paper proposes a gravity heat pipe exchanger used for cooling the communication base station to replace the traditional air conditioning system during winter and transition seasons. Tests were conducted on a commercial available gravity heat pipe exchanger. The experiment was performed to study the effects of the air flow rate and temperature on the cooling capacity, the heat transfer unit number (NTU) and cooling efficiency of the heat pipe exchanger. The results showed that the larger the air flow rate, the smaller the NTU and the larger the cooling capacity. Based on the analysis of the experimental data, it proved that the gravity heat pipe exchanger could reduce running time and operating cost of air conditioning system. According to the practical applications, the yearly cooling loads of a typical communication base station were further calculated for five typical cities which represent the five climatic zones of China. The results validated that the energy saving by using the gravity heat pipe exchanger is significant. The highest annual electricity-saving rate is achieved by Kunming, about 48.6%, while the lowest annual electricity-saving rate is obtained in Guangzhou, about 18.7% among the five climatic zones. The fitted correlation of cooling capacity in term of outdoor temperature is generic to evaluate approximately the performance of applying the gravity heat pipe exchanger in the actual applications subject to various outdoor temperatures.

"State feedback method is quite popular in control engineering field. However, some popular properties of state feedback approach cannot be used while any of the system states cannot be obtained beforehand. Therefore, this paper proposes a new observer design for a class of uncertain systems through sliding mode control theory. Based on strictly positive real concept, the stability of the equivalent error system is verified. Further, by using the generalized matrix inverse approach, the proposed switching term can drive the error states to zero, and it ensures the global reaching condition of the sliding mode of the error system. Moreover, the presented sliding mode observer is proposed to possess the invariance property to the uncertainty and/or external disturbance. Furthermore, the developed sliding mode observer is extended to release the limitation of knowing the bounds of the lumped perturbations in advance. That is, not only a new sliding mode observer but also a new adaptive sliding mode observer is proposed in this paper. Finally, three examples are illustrated to demonstrate the validity of the proposed sliding mode observer and the proposed adaptive sliding mode observer.

"It has been suggested that dogs' ability to comprehend human pointing gestures evolved as a by-product of the socio-emotional changes associated with domestication. Given the large role played by the oxytocin system in socio-emotional processes, it is possible to hypothesize a role for oxytocin in modulating dogs' socio-communicative skills. Indeed, it has been shown that intranasal oxytocin enhances dogs' ability to use human pointing cues in an object choice task, a classic paradigm used to assess the ability to follow a pointing gesture. We further tested this hypothesis in another sample of dogs and replicated the above findings. We also provided a novel explanation to the above findings, suggesting that oxytocin released during human-dog interactions increases the positive expectations about human behaviour via emotion and reward processes and thus facilitates the interpretation of pointing as leading to positive events. Given the large and deep homology across mammals in the neural mechanisms involved in emotions, oxytocin could be involved in the acquisition of socio-communicative skills during human typical as well as pathological development.",62
"This paper presents a combined daylight, airflow network and building energy simulation of a Public Rental Housing (PRH) development in Hong Kong to fulfil the requirement of the local green building guidance. The numerical modelling results are partly validated by on-site measurements during the period with the highest monthly average outdoor temperature. Different ventilation control strategies are simulated to optimize natural ventilation performance. The simulation results show that the full-day ventilation strategy contributes to a lower average and peak indoor temperatures compared to the non-ventilation and night-ventilation scenarios. The indoor operative temperature of a worst-case vacant flat lies under the upper 80% acceptability limits in ASHRAE 55 during 67.5% of the modelled period in July. On the other side, at least 95.6% of the habitable area in the case buildings is predicted to experience a higher average daylight factor of 1% compared with the local green building guidance. Furthermore, the energy saving potential of the combined natural ventilation and daylight strategies is anticipated to be 51.9% for air-conditioning and 8.3% for lighting compared to a baseline building, respectively.

"Whereas selenium (Se) is an important antioxidant in human metabolism to prevent cancer, aflatoxins are highly carcinogenic. Brazil nuts from Eastern and Western Amazon regions were evaluated to find any relationship between Se and aflatoxins levels. A total of 80 (in-shell and shelled) nuts samples were collected directly from different forest sites and analyzed for Se by atomic emission spectrometry and aflatoxins by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The limit of quantitation (LOQ) for Se was 2.0 mg/kg, and LOQ for total aflatoxins was 0.390 mu g/kg. Nut Se levels from the Eastern region were higher than the Western, in addition to the aflatoxins. The moisture content (mc) and water activity (a(w)) of the raw nuts from the two regions did not present a significant difference, for either in-shell or shelled. The mc was 24.5% (minimum of 20.1% and maximum of 30.4%) and 22.1% (minimum of 14.6% and maximum of 28.9%) and a(w) of 0.85 for both regions. Further studies need to be carried out to discover the role of Se on fungi growth stress and aflatoxin production mechanisms.",32
"Hypertension is a risk factor for cognitive impairment in older age. However, evidence of the neural basis of the relationship between the deterioration of cognitive function and elevated blood pressure is sparse. Based on previous research, we speculate that variations in brain connectivity are closely related to elevated blood pressure even before the onset of clinical conditions and apparent cognitive decline in individuals over 60 years of age. Forty cognitively healthy adults were recruited. Each received a blood pressure test before and after the cognitive assessment in various domains. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data were collected. Our findings confirm that elevated blood pressure is associated with brain connectivity variations in cognitively healthy individuals. The integrity of the splenium of the corpus callosum is closely related to individual differences in systolic blood pressure. In particular, elevated systolic blood pressure is related to resting-state ventral attention network (VAN) and information processing speed. Serial mediation analyses have further revealed that lower integrity of the splenium statistically predicts elevated systolic blood pressure, which in turn predicts weakened functional connectivity (FC) within the VAN and eventually poorer processing speed. The current study sheds light on how neural correlates are involved in the impact of elevated blood pressure on cognitive functioning.",119
"Introduction: Myelofibrosis (MF) is a Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm that is associated with debilitating constitutional symptoms, progressive splenomegaly, and cytopenias. Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, is currently the only drug approved for the treatment of patients with intermediate or high risk MF. There is rationale and even limited clinical data supporting the use of ruxolitinib in lower risk patients, although this has not yet been validated in a randomized controlled trial.Areas covered: We examine rationale for using ruxolitinib in lower risk MF patients, including survival data from COMFORT-I and COMFORT-II, specific patient populations that may derive clinical benefit, and the future impact of molecular analysis on risk stratification and treatment. Additionally, we consider the potential risks associated with earlier intervention with ruxolitinib therapy.Expert commentary: Although there exists rationale for the use of JAK2 inhibitor therapy in lower risk MF patients, we eagerly await the results of an ongoing randomized controlled trial addressing this question before recommending wider use in the community setting.",12
"Between May 1995 and June 1999, we studied denning ecology of 8 1 barren-ground grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) equipped with satellite radio-collars within a study area of 235,000 km(2), centered 400 km northeast of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada. All dens were located on well-drained slopes ((X) over bar = 25.3degrees, SE = 1.20, it = 55). Choice of den aspect was nonrandom (chi(2) = 12.4, d.f. = 3, P0.5 in) shrubs (Betula glandulosa and Salix), the root structures of which supported ceilings of dens. Selection of denning habitat by bears was significantly different from random (G = 127.67, d.f. = 6, P < 0.0001). Bonferroni confidence intervals indicated that esker habitat was selected more than expected by chance (P < 0.10). Den entrance occurred primarily in last 2 weeks of October. The majority of bears emerged from dens in the 1st week of May.",54
"Despite the compelling nature of goodness of fit, empirical support has lagged for this construct. The present study examined an interactional approach to measuring goodness of fit and prospectively explored associations with mother-child relationship quality, child behaviour problems and parenting stress across the preschool period. In addition, as goodness of fit might be particularly important for children at developmental risk, the presence of early developmental delay was considered as a moderator of goodness-of-fit processes. Children with (n=110) and without (n=137) developmental delays and their mothers were coded while interacting in the lab at child age 36months and during naturalistic home observations at child ages 36 and 48months. Mothers also completed questionnaires at child age 60months. Results highlight the effects of child developmental risk as a moderator of mother-child goodness-of-fit processes across the preschool period. There was also evidence that the goodness of fit between maternal scaffolding and child activity level at 36months influenced both mother and child functioning at 60months. Findings call for more precise models and expanded developmental perspectives to fully capture the transactional and dynamic nature of goodness of fit. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",18
"Background: Although most individuals experience successful weight loss following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), weight regain is a concern, the composition of which is not well documented. Our aim was to evaluate changes in body composition and handgrip strength as a measure of functional status in participants from a previous 1-year post-RYGB longitudinal study who had undergone RYGB approximately 9 years prior. Methods: Five women from an original larger cohort were monitored pre-RYGB and 1.5 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 9 years post-RYGB. Body composition was assessed at all time points using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry and multiple dilution. Handgrip strength was measured using a digital isokinetic hand dynamometer (Takei Scientific Instruments, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). Results: Mean time to final follow-up was 8.7 years. Lean soft tissue (LST) loss over the similar to 9-year period was on average 11.9 +/- 5.6 kg. Compared with 1-year post-RYGB, 9-year LST was 4.4 +/- 3.0 kg lower (P = .03). Fat-free mass decreased over the 9-year period by 12.6 +/- 5.8 kg. Mean fat mass (FM) decreased from 75.4 +/- 22.6 kg pre-RYGB to 35.5 +/- 21.5 kg 1 year post-RYGB but then trended toward an increase of 8.6 +/- 7.0 kg between 1 year and 9 years post-RYGB (P = .053). Loss of LST was correlated with loss of handgrip strength (r = 0.64, P = .0005). Conclusion: The continued loss of lean mass associated with decreased handgrip strength occurring with long-term trend toward FM regain post-RYGB is concerning. The loss of LST and functional strength carries particular implications for the aging bariatric population and should be investigated further.",121

"Background: Implementing quality improvement in hospitals requires a multifaceted commitment from leaders, including financial, material, and personnel resources. However, little is known about the interactional resources needed for project implementation. The aim of this analysis was to identify the types of interactional support hospital teams sought in a surgical quality improvement project. Methods: Hospital site visits were conducted using a combination of observations, interviews, and focus groups to explore the implementation of a surgical quality improvement project. Twenty-six site visits were conducted between October 2012 and August 2014 at a total of 16 hospitals that agreed to participate. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded for themes using inductive analysis. Results: We interviewed 321 respondents and conducted an additional 28 focus groups. Respondents reported needing the following types of interactional support during implementation of quality improvement interventions: (1) a critical outside perspective on their implementation progress; (2) opportunities to learn from peers, especially around clinical innovations; and (3) external validation to help establish visibility for and commitment to the project. Conclusions: Quality improvement in hospitals is both a clinical endeavor and a social endeavor. Our findings show that teams often desire interactional resources as they implement quality improvement initiatives. In-person site visits can provide these resources while also activating emotional energy for teams, which builds momentum and sustainability for quality improvement work. Implications: Policymakers and quality improvement leaders will benefit from developing strategies to maximize interactional learning and feedback for quality improvement teams. Further research should investigate the most effective methods for meeting these needs.",66
"Abundance and seasonal trophodynamics (specific growth rate, daily production, and grazing mortality) of the major picophytoplankton components, Synechococcus cyanobacteria (Syn) and picoeukaryotes (Pico-E), were studied at three stations in Sevastopol Bay and adjacent coastal waters (the Black Sea) in 2014 by flow cytometry and the dilution method. Pico-E abundance was shown to increase along the nutrient and pollution gradient from the coastal waters outside the bay (annual average of 7.3 +/- 5.4 x 10(3) cells mL(-1)) to the eastern corner of the bay (28.7 +/- 11.4 x 10(3) cells mL(-1)), while no relation was found between the water pollution status and Syn abundance (9.9 +/- 8.7 x 10(3) cells mL(-1); at all the stations, n = 27). Matter flows through the communities (daily production for Syn and Pico-E 0(-1)6.6 and 0(-1)9.3 A mu g C L-1 day(-1), respectively; grazing mortality for Syn and PicoE 0-3.6 and 0-21.2 A mu g C L-1 day(-1), respectively) were comparable to or even exceeded their biomass stocks (>0.05-6.8 and 0.9-26.5 A mu g C L-1 for Syn and PicoE, respectively), indicating high biomass turnover rates. The highest flow-to-stock ratio (up to 6 for Syn) and a significant imbalance between daily production (P) and grazing mortality (G) were observed in the most polluted and eutrophic waters of the bay in spring (Pico-E: P/G1). Black River inflow to the bay was hypothesized to be among the mechanisms maintaining this pronounced and long-term imbalance in the open system without any negative consequences for the picophytoplankton assemblages.",96
"Human adults automatically mimic others' emotional expressions, which is believed to contribute to sharing emotions with others. Although this behaviour appears fundamental to social reciprocity, little is known about its developmental process. Therefore, we examined whether infants show automatic facial mimicry in response to others' emotional expressions. Facial electromyographic activity over the corrugator supercilii (brow) and zygomaticus major (cheek) of four-to five-month-old infants was measured while they viewed dynamic clips presenting audiovisual, visual and auditory emotions. The audiovisual bimodal emotion stimuli were a display of a laughing/crying facial expression with an emotionally congruent vocalization, whereas the visual/auditory unimodal emotion stimuli displayed those emotional faces/vocalizations paired with a neutral vocalization/face, respectively. Increased activation of the corrugator supercilii muscle in response to audiovisual cries and the zygomaticus major in response to audiovisual laughter were observed between 500 and 1000 ms after stimulus onset, which clearly suggests rapid facial mimicry. By contrast, both visual and auditory unimodal emotion stimuli did not activate the infants' corresponding muscles. These results revealed that automatic facial mimicry is present as early as five months of age, when multimodal emotional information is present.",62
"Young bisexual women experience worse mental and sexual health outcomes in comparison to their heterosexual and lesbian peers. These disparities are associated with stigma and devaluation of bisexual identities. The current paper addresses a community-based focus group project in which participants discussed bisexual stigma in regard to bisexual erasure and other stereotypes. Specifically, participants detailed experiences of feeling pressured to provide evidence of their bisexual identity, modifying their relationship or sexual behavior to conform to these expectations, as well as feeling excluded from queer community. Further, participants discussed how these experiences were related to decreased mental and sexual health. Future research should further investigate the relationship between bisexual stigma, pressure to provide evidence of bisexual identity, and negative mental and sexual health outcomes.",61
"Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), including the mass-produced component of plastics, bisphenol A (BPA) are widely prevalent in aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Many aquatic species, such as fish, amphibians, aquatic reptiles and mammals, are exposed daily to high concentrations of BPA and ethinyl estradiol (EE2), estrogen in birth control pills. In this review, we will predominantly focus on BPA and EE2, well-described estrogenic EDCs. First, the evidence that BPA and EE2 are detectable in almost all bodies of water will be discussed. We will consider how BPA affects sexual and neural development in these species, as these effects have been the best characterized across taxa. For instance, such chemicals have been in many cases reported to cause sex-reversal of males to females. Even if these chemicals do not overtly alter the gonadal sex, there are indications that several EDCs might demasculinize male-specific behaviors that are essential for attracting a mate. In so doing, these chemicals may reduce the likelihood that these males reproduce. If exposed males do reproduce, the concern is that they will then be passing on compromised genetic fitness to their offspring and transmitting potential transgenerational effects through their sperm epigenome. We will thus consider how diverse epigenetic changes might be a unifying mechanism of how BPA and EE2 disrupt several processes across species. Such changes might also serve as universal species diagnostic biomarkers of BPA and other EDCs exposure. Lastly, the evidence that estrogenic EDCs-induced effects in aquatic species might translate to humans will be considered. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",116
"Surge tank is provided in the secondary sodium circuit of Sodium cooled Fast Reactors (SFR) to protect the secondary sodium circuit components from the pressure surges due to sodium water reaction in Steam Generator (SG). The pressurized argon gas inside the surge tank above sodium will act as a cushion and absorb the pressure surges. The entrainment of argon gas into the sodium due to free level fluctuations, turbulence etc. can cause operational difficulties in reactor. It is necessary to develop effective gas entrainment mitigating devices which keeps the sodium free surface calm but the development only through experiments is difficult and time consuming. Therefore a CFD model of surge tank is developed to predict the surge tank hydraulics and it is validated through experiments. Velocity measurement in the model at different directions and different elevations has been carried out using Ultrasonic Velocity Profiler (UVP).",83
"We studied a mango glutathione S-transferase (GST) (Mangifera indica) bound to glutathione (GSH) and S-hexyl glutathione (GSX). This GST Tau class (MiGSTU) had a molecular mass of 25.5 kDa. MiGSTU Michaelis-Menten kinetic constants were determined for their substrates obtaining a Km, V-max and k(cat) for CDNB of 0.792 mM, 80.58 mM min (-1) and 68.49 s(-1) respectively and 0.693 mM, 105.32 mM min -1 and 89.57 s(-1), for reduced GSH respectively. MiGSTU had a micromolar affinity towards GSH (5.2 mu M) or GSX (7.8 mu M). The crystal structure of the MiGSTU in apo or bound to GSH or GSX generated a model that explains the thermodynamic signatures of binding and showed the importance of enthalpic-entropic compensation in ligand binding to Tau-class GST enzymes.

"Confirmation of pregnancy viability (presence of fetal cardiac activity) and diagnosis of fetal presentation (head or buttock in the maternal pelvis) are the first essential components of ultrasound assessment in obstetrics. The former is useful in assessing the presence of an on-going pregnancy and the latter is essential for labour management. We propose an automated framework for detection of fetal presentation and heartbeat from a predefined free-hand ultrasound sweep of the maternal abdomen. Our method exploits the presence of key anatomical sonographic image patterns in carefully designed scanning protocols to develop, for the first time, an automated framework allowing novice sonographers to detect fetal breech presentation and heartbeat from an ultrasound sweep. The framework consists of a classification regime for a frame by frame categorization of each 2D slice of the video. The classification scores are then regularized through a conditional random field model, taking into account the temporal relationship between the video frames. Subsequently, if consecutive frames of the fetal heart are detected, a kernelized linear dynamical model is used to identify whether a heartbeat can be detected in the sequence. In a dataset of 323 predefined free-hand videos, covering the mother's abdomen in a straight sweep, the fetal skull, abdomen, and heart were detected with a mean classification accuracy of 83.4%. Furthermore, for the detection of the heartbeat an overall classification accuracy of 93.1% was achieved. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",1
"There is information indicating that the variations induced by the menstrual cycle may influence the capacity of young women to respond to stress. The physiological response to stress changes across the stages of the lifespan; however, in spite of the great increase in life expectancy, the way women react after inenopause, a period characterized by a dramatic decline in sex hormones, has not been sufficiently studied. The main objective of the study was to examine the capacity to respond to and recover from an acute social stressor in post-menopausal women compared to young women. The second objective was to investigate the consequences of behavior on the self-regulatory systems. We measured behavior, cortisol, dnd heart rate during a speaking task in front of a committee in sixty-seven women: 36 post-menopausal and 31 pre-menopausal (follicular group n = 14; luteal group n = 17). No differences in heart rate reactivity between three groups were found. Post-menopausal women showed less cortisol reactivity to stress; they also displayed a higher percentage of Gestures during the speaking task, reflecting a clearer pattern of active coping compared to the young women. In post-menopausal women, behaviors that reflect active coping strategies were related to better autonomic regulation. By contrast, in pre-menopausal women, cortisol changes seemed to be modulated by passive and reactive behaviors such as Submission and Assertion. These results emphasize the importance of considering age and Hormonal Status in coping processes, including reactivity and recovery from stressful situations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Background: Phenotyping is a critical component of plant research. Accurate and precise trait collection, when integrated with genetic tools, can greatly accelerate the rate of genetic gain in crop improvement. However, efficient and automatic phenotyping of traits across large populations is a challenge; which is further exacerbated by the necessity of sampling multiple environments and growing replicated trials. A promising approach is to leverage current advances in imaging technology, data analytics and machine learning to enable automated and fast phenotyping and subsequent decision support. In this context, the workflow for phenotyping (image capture. data storage and curation ->trait extraction ->machine learning/classification ->models/apps for decision support) has to be carefully designed and efficiently executed to minimize resource usage and maximize utility. We illustrate such an end- to- end phenotyping workflow for the case of plant stress severity phenotyping in soybean, with a specific focus on the rapid and automatic assessment of iron deficiency chlorosis (IDC) severity on thousands of field plots. We showcase this analytics framework by extracting IDC features from a set of similar to 4500 unique canopies representing a diverse germplasm base that have different levels of IDC, and subsequently training a variety of classification models to predict plant stress severity. The best classifier is then deployed as a smartphone app for rapid and real time severity rating in the field. Results: We investigated 10 different classification approaches, with the best classifier being a hierarchical classifier with a mean per-class accuracy of similar to 96%. We construct a phenotypically meaningful ' population canopy graph', connecting the automatically extracted canopy trait features with plant stress severity rating. We incorporated this image capture ->image processing ->classification workflow into a smartphone app that enables automated real-time evaluation of IDC scores using digital images of the canopy. Conclusion: We expect this high-throughput framework to help increase the rate of genetic gain by providing a robust extendable framework for other abiotic and biotic stresses. We further envision this workflow embedded onto a high throughput phenotyping ground vehicle and unmanned aerial system that will allow real-time, automated stress trait detection and quantification for plant research, breeding and stress scouting applications.",1
"Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) have emerged as a new class of anticancer agents, targeting the biological process including cell cycle and apoptosis. We investigated and explained the anticancer effects of an HDAC6 inhibitor, ricolinostat alone and in combination with bendamustine in lymphoma cell lines. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, Bcl-2 protein expression, cell cycle progression and tubuline expression were determined by flow cytometry. The effects of ricolinostat alone and in combination on the caspases, PI3K/Akt, Bcl-2 pathways, ER stress and UPR were assessed by immunoblotting. Ricolinostat shows anti lymphoma activity when used as single agent and its capability to induce apoptosis is synergistically potentiated by the bendamustine in lymphoma cell lines. Drug combination reduced the proportion of cells in the G(0)/G(1) and S phases and caused an increase of ""sub-G(0)/G(1)"" peak. The synergistic effect accompanied with the increased ROS, activation of caspase-8, -9, and -3, the cleavage of PARP and modulated by Bcl-2 proteins family. In addition, the exposure of ricolinostat induced the acetylation level of alpha-tubulin, the extend of which was not further modified by bendamustine. Finally, the apoptosis effect of ricolinostat/bendamustine may be mediated by a corresponding effect on microtubule stabilization. Our data suggest that ricolinostat in combination with bendamustine may be a novel combination with potential for use as an antitumor agent in lymphoma.",7
"Research on video game violence has focused on the impact of aggression, but has so far neglected the processes and mechanisms underlying the enjoyment of video game violence. The present contribution examines a specific process in this context, namely players' strategies to cope with moral concern that would (in real-life settings) arise from violent actions. Based on Bandura's (2002) theory of moral disengagement, we argue that in order to maintain their enjoyment of game violence, players find effective strategies to avoid or cope with the moral conflict related to their violent behaviors in the game world ('moral management'). Exploratory interviews with ten players of violent video games revealed some relevance of moral reasoning to their game enjoyment, and several strategies that help players to 'manage' moral concern. Most importantly, respondents referred to the game-reality distinction and their focus on winning the game when explaining how violent action is a by-product of good performance. Findings are discussed in light of further theorizing on 'moral management' and potential links to the media violence debate.",74
"A leading intellectual challenge in evolutionary genetics is to identify the specific phenotypes that drive adaptation. Enzymes offer a particularly promising opportunity to pursue this question, because many enzymes' contributions to organismal fitness depend on a comparatively small number of experimentally accessible properties. Moreover, on first principles the demands of enzyme thermostability stand in opposition to the demands of catalytic activity. This observation, coupled with the fact that enzymes are only marginally thermostable, motivates the widely held hypothesis that mutations conferring functional improvement require compensatory mutations to restore thermostability. Here, we explicitly test this hypothesis for the first time, using four missense mutations in TEM-1 beta-lactamase that jointly increase cefotaxime Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) similar to 1500-fold. First, we report enzymatic efficiency (k(cat)/K-M) and thermostability (T-m, and thence Delta G of folding) for all combinations of these mutations. Next, we fit a quantitative model that predicts MIC as a function of k(cat)/K-M and Delta G. While k(cat)/K-M explains similar to 54% of the variance in cefotaxime MIC (similar to 92% after log transformation), Delta G does not improve explanatory power of the model. We also find that cefotaxime MIC rises more slowly in k(cat)/K-M than predicted. Several explanations for these discrepancies are suggested. Finally, we demonstrate substantial sign epistasis in MIC and k(cat)/K-M, and antagonistic pleiotropy between phenotypes, in spite of near numerical additivity in the system. Thus constraints on selectively accessible trajectories, as well as limitations in our ability to explain such constraints in terms of underlying mechanisms are observed in a comparatively ""well-behaved"" system.",34
"We model attacks on a cyberphysical system as a game between two players-the attacker and the system. The players may not acquire the complete information about each other, and that leads to an asymmetric information game. Furthermore, the players may have a certain fixed amount of resources, which constrains their strategies across time. Accordingly, we consider a dynamic multiplayer nonzero sum game with asymmetric information in which controllers have total resource constraints. Under certain assumptions on the information structure of the game, we devise an algorithm that computes a subclass of Nash equilibria of the game. We also study a denial-of-service attack on a cyberphysical system, model it as two-player zero-sum games, and apply our algorithm to compute the saddle-point equilibrium strategies of the attacker and the controller.",46
"Studies have found evidence that, after playing violent videogames for 20 min, people experience a mean short-term increase in aggression, hostility, and anger. The current research investigated whether or not players habituate during longer, more realistic lengths of play. Participants (N = 98) were randomly assigned to play the game Quake III Arena for either 20 or 60 min. Participants in the long condition showed a smaller change in state anger (CSA) from pre- to post-gameplay than those in the short condition, although this did not reach significance. Change in scores for gamers (not novice players) showed that short gaming led to a larger increase in anger ratings than long gaming. When the results for violent videogame players were analysed separately, there was no significant increase in anger post-gameplayirrespective of length of time playing. Results also supported the hypotheses that females would show a significantly larger CSA than males and that participants previously unexposed to violent videogames would show a significantly larger CSA than exposed participants.",74
"In this paper, we applied a hot water-induced thermotherapy system to the foot, based on the oriental medicine principle of Dongeuibogam, which is concerned with the notion that the head should be kept cool and the feet warm. The objective of this study was to determine the influence on the cardiovascular system effected by physiological parameters inherent to thermal stimulation at a temperature of 43 degrees C. Therefore, the relevant physiological parameters, blood flow, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and leg temperature, associated with the cardiovascular system, were selected for analysis. The experimental equipment used in this study included a hot water system designed for the feet. Pre and post experimental conditions, at a temperature of 43 degrees C, were assessed for 10 healthy volunteers over 10 days. Pre and post measurements were obtained at 5. 10, 15, and 20 minutes. The biosignal transition results of the experiments were as follows; Blood Flow(ml/min): 1.18 +/- 0.50 inc, Heart Rate(bpm): 6.97 +/- 0.72 inc, Blood Pressure(mmHg): (max) -1.49 +/- 2.81 dec, (min) 0.06 +/- 0.13 dec, Oxygen Saturation(%): 1.34 +/- 0.28 inc, (dec: decrease, inc: increase). According to our results, hot-water thermotherapy applied to the foot does appear to exert an influence on the cardiovascular system, and also appears to generally improve human metabolism.",32
"Substance use disorders (SUD) and mental health disorders are significant public health issues that co-occur and are associated with high risk for suicide attempts. SUD and mental health disorders are more prevalent among offenders (i.e., prisoners or inmates) than the non-imprisoned population, raising concerns about the risk of self-harm. This cross-sectional study examined the population of a state prison system (10,988 out of 13,079) to identify associations among SUD (alcohol, cannabis, intravenous drugs, narcotics, and tobacco smoking), mental health disorders (anxiety, bipolar, depression, and psychotic disorders), and suicide attempts. The primary aim was to determine which groups (SUD, mental health disorders, and co-occurrences) were strongly association with suicide attempts. Groups with a documented SUD or mental health disorders compared to peers without these issues had 2.0 and 9.2 greater odds, respectively, for attempting suicide, which was significant at p < 0.0001 for both conditions. There were also significant differences within SUD and mental health disorders groups in regard to suicide attempts. Groups with the greatest odds for suicide attempts were offenders with comorbid bipolar comorbid and anxiety, alcohol combined with depression, and cannabis co-occurring with depression. Documentation of suicide attempts during imprisonment indicates awareness, but also suggest a need to continue enhancing screening and evaluating environmental settings.",115
"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and comprises approximately 30% of all lymphomas. Patients typically present with a nonpainful mass in the neck, groin, or abdomen associated with constitutional symptoms. In this report, however, the authors describe a rare case of a 61-year-old woman with hyperprolactinemia, hypothyroidism, and acromegaly (elevation of insulin-like growth factor-1 [IGF-1]) with elevated growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) in whom an MRI demonstrated diffuse enlargement of the pituitary gland. Despite medical treatment, the patient had persistent elevation of IGF-1. She underwent a transsphenoidal biopsy, which yielded a diagnosis of DLBCL with an activated B-cell immunophenotype with somatotroph hyperplasia. After stereo tactic radiation therapy in combination with chemotherapy, she is currently in remission from her lymphoma and has normalized IGF-1 levels without medical therapy, 8 months after her histopathological diagnosis. This is the only reported case of its kind and displays the importance of a broad differential diagnosis, multidisciplinary evaluation, and critical intraoperative decision-making when treating atypical sellar lesions.",133
"STUDY QUESTION: Are parity and the timing of menarche associated with premature and early natural menopause? SUMMARY ANSWER: Early menarche (<= 11 years) is a risk factor for both premature menopause (final menstrual period, FMP <40 years) and early menopause (FMP 40-44 years), a risk that is amplified for nulliparous women. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Women with either premature or early menopause face an increased risk of chronic conditions in later life and of early death. Findings from some studies suggest that early menarche and nulliparity are associated with early menopause, however overall the evidence is mixed. Much of the evidence for a direct relationship is hampered by a lack of comparability across studies, failure to adjust for confounding factors and inadequate statistical power. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This pooled study comprises 51 450 postmenopausal women from nine observational studies in the UK, Scandinavia, Australia and Japan that contribute to the International collaboration for a Life course Approach to reproductive health and Chronic disease Events (InterLACE). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Age at menarche (categorized as <= 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 or more years) and parity (categorized as no children, one child and two or more children) were exposures of interest. Age at FMP was confirmed by at least 12 months of cessation of menses where this was not the result of an intervention (such as surgical menopause due to bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy) and categorized as premature menopause (FMP before age 40), early menopause (FMP 40-44 years), 45-49 years, 50-51 years, 52-53 years and 54 or more years. We used multivariate multinomial logistic regression models to estimate relative risk ratio (RRR) and 95% CI for associations between menarche, parity and age at FMP adjusting for within-study correlation. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The median age at FMP was 50 years (interquartile range 48-53 years), with 2% of the women experiencing premature menopause and 7.6% early menopause. Women with early menarche (= 12 years and two or more children. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Most of the studies (except the birth cohorts) relied on retrospectively reported age at menarche, which may have led to some degree of recall bias. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our findings support early monitoring of women with early menarche, especially those who have no children, for preventive health interventions aimed at mitigating the risk of adverse health outcomes associated with early menopause.

"Developing highly active photocatalysts for water treatment is of vital importance. A large-mesopore hierarchical WO3 hydrate photocatalyst with exposed high energy facets was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method using sodium chloride as structure-directing agent. The forming model of the hierarchical structure was discussed, and photogenerated oxide species were investigated. It is shown that the orthorhombic WO3 center dot 1/3H(2)O photocatalyst is of a hierarchical structure assembled by various 2-dimension nanosheets and that its average pore diameter reaches approximately 33.2 nm. Besides, it could decompose 92% of rhodamine B (Rh B) under visible light irradiation within four hours. The enhanced photocatalytic efficiency is attributed to the exposed high energy (002) crystal facets of hierarchical structure, and to the large mesopores existing between crossed nanosheets which help to charge carriers separation, adsorption of reactants and desorption of product molecules. Furthermore, the catalyst displays an excellent photocatalytic stability, indicating its broad application in water pollution treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",96
"Weight and efficiency are conflicting top requirements for all kind of mobile applications of electrical machines. Utilizing the design freedom of a novel machine design, based on a slotless air gap winding while providing high torque and efficient cooling, this paper presents a design optimization approach that allows for precise and fast design of that type of machine. Design speed is achieved by building a simplified parametric model of the electrical machine that combines very well with a nonlinear optimization formulation of the design problem, where machine mass and losses are balanced out to find a Pareto optimal design set. Additional design requirements are treated via constraints. The parametric machine model was built upon a numerical finite elements method analysis of magnetic flux density in the air gap with ANSYS Maxwell, which is used to formulate parametric Fourier series based models of flux acting on a phase, flux acting on a six-step commutated winding and effective flux useful to define machine torque constant. Except the numerical optimization procedure, all model and design equations can be formulated analytically exploiting Maple's symbolic computation features, thus simplifying analysis and speeding up design. Finally, an optimal motor design study for a 15-inch rim wheel-hub drive is presented. The range of a tradeoff between demands for weight and efficiency while delivering the required torque at nominal speed is shown.",24
"Transformation of research in all biological fields necessitates the design, analysis and, interpretation of large data sets. Preparing students with the requisite skills in experimental design, statistical analysis, and interpretation, and mathematical reasoning will require both curricular reform and faculty who are willing and able to integrate mathematical and statistical concepts into their life science courses. A new Faculty Learning Community (FLC) was constituted each year for four years to assist in the transformation of the life sciences curriculum and faculty at a large, Midwestern research university. Participants were interviewed after participation and surveyed before and after participation to assess the impact of the FLC on their attitudes toward teaching, perceived pedagogical skills, and planned teaching practice. Overall, the FLC had a meaningful positive impact on participants' attitudes toward teaching, knowledge about teaching, and perceived pedagogical skills. Interestingly, confidence for viewing the classroom as a site for research about teaching declined. Implications for the creation and development of FLCs for science faculty are discussed.

"Considerable heterogeneity is observed among patients with a Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). In the present study, we investigated whether we could identify and validate different personality subtypes in 150 BPD inpatients based on reactive and regulative temperament. We identified four BPD subtypes by means of cluster analysis on the Behavioral Inhibition and Behavioral Activation Scales (BISBAS) and the Effortful Control Scale (ECS): an Emotional/Disinhibited subtype (45%) scoring lowest on Effortful Control, an Inhibited subtype (24%) characterized bylaw levels of Behavioral Activation, a Low Anxiety subtype (21%) defined by low levels of Behavioral Inhibition, and a High Self-control subtype (10%) characterized by the highest score on effortful control. The four subtypes were validated by comparing them on clinical symptomatology, comorbid personality disorders, and coping. The current findings offer insight into meaningful differences among BPD patients based on temperamental features, which can offer guidelines for the treatment of BPD patients. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Background: Adults with eating disorders (ED) show brain volume reductions in the frontal, insular, cingulate, and parietal cortices, as well as differences in subcortical regions associated with reward processing. However, little is known about the structural differences in adolescents with behavioural indications of early stage ED.Aim: This is the first study to investigate structural brain changes in adolescents newly diagnosed with ED compared to healthy controls (HC), and to study whether ED cognitions correlate with structural changes in adolescents with ED of short duration.Methods: Fifteen adolescent females recently diagnosed with ED, and 28 age-matched HC individuals, were scanned with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Whole-brain and region-of-interest analyses were conducted using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). ED cognitions were measured with self-report questionnaires and working memory performance was measured with a neuropsychological computerized test.Results and conclusions: The left superior temporal gyrus had a smaller volume in adolescents with ED than in HC, which correlated with ED cognitions (concerns about eating, weight, and shape). Working memory reaction time correlated positively with insula volumes in ED participants, but not HC. In ED, measurements of restraint and obsession was negatively correlated with temporal gyrus volumes, and positively correlated with cerebellar and striatal volumes. Thus, adolescents with a recent diagnosis of ED had volumetric variations in brain areas linked to ED cognitions, obsessions, and working memory. The findings emphasize the importance of early identification of illness, before potential long-term effects on structure and behaviour occur.",67
"Spread spectrum is a technique introduced for mitigating electromagnetic interference (EMI) problems in many class of circuits. In this paper, with particular emphasis on switching DC/DC converters, we consider the most common and most efficient known spreading techniques, looking for spreading parameters that ensure the highest EMI reduction and the lowest performance reduction in the circuit where the spreading is applied. The result is an interesting tradeoff not only between EMI reduction and performance drop, but also on the EMI reduction itself when considering different EMI victim models. The proposed analysis is supported by measurements on two switching DC/DC converters: 1) based on pulse width modulation and 2) based on the resonant converter class.",60

"Transmission towers play an important role in transmitting electricity in a power grid safely and reliably. In traditional design practice, the second-order P-Delta (frame side sway) and P-delta (member curvature) effects and joint effects such as load eccentricities, slippage effects, and semirigid connection are commonly ignored in analysis. Great discrepancy is frequently noted between full-scale tower tests and numerical simulations using first-order linear analysis. In this paper, second-order direct analysis is used and slippage of bolted joints as well as semirigid connection behavior are taken into account. Member initial bowing and frame out-of-plumbness imperfections are considered in the present study, which is verified by full-scale test on an ultrahigh-voltage (UHV) lattice transmission tower. The technique of semirigid design and simulation of joint stiffness for load eccentricity by simple modeling for transmission towers meeting the requirements for direct analysis with verification by a full-scale test is unavailable in literature and proposed in this paper. Furthermore, the influences of joint slippage on the deflection and load behavior of the studied towers are quantified and reported. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.",43
"Friction is a phenomenon involving elastic interactions, plastic deformation and failure processes at different length scales. The friction coefficient is one of the most relevant parameters for the rolling contact of railway wheels and rails. A model of dry friction is established based on the method of movable cellular automata (MCA). The influence of pressure and sliding velocity has been investigated by means of a large number of numerical simulations. A general qualitative conclusion is the fact that dynamic processes of plastic deformation and fracture at the nanolevel are of great importance. Within this model, the contact temperature can also be considered by its influence on the strength of materials. The new friction law is applied to the calculation of stresses, deformations and tractive forces in wheel/rail contact with rough surfaces. Thus, the understanding for the physical background of dry friction in engineering applications can be considerably improved. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",91

"The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between overall emotional intelligence and its components and reflectivity/impulsivity learning style of iranian efl learners. Emotional intelligence and learning style of 52 female efl learners from avaye no and morad takro private institutes in tabriz were obtained through bar-on's emotional quotient inventory and learning style questionnaire. Then, pearson's correlation analyses were conducted to measure the degree of the relationship between emotional intelligence as well as its components and learning style of the participants. The results of the correlation analyses indicated that overall emotional intelligence had a statistically positive relationship with the learning style of the efl learners. It was also found that among components of emotional intelligence only intrapersonal, adaptability, and stress management components revealed a significant relationship with learning style of the participants.

"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematological cancer, characterized by a reciprocal chromosomal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 [t(9;22)], producing the Bcr-Abl oncogene. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) represent the standard of care for CML patients and exert a dual mode of action: direct oncokinase inhibition and restoration of effector-mediated immune surveillance, which is rendered dysfunctional in CML patients at diagnosis, prior to TKI therapy. TKIs such as imatinib, and more potent second-generation nilotinib and dasatinib induce a high rate of deep molecular response (DMR, BCR-ABL1 <= 0.01%) in CML patients. As a result, the more recent goal of therapy in CML treatment is to induce a durable DMR as a prelude to successful treatment-free remission (TFR), which occurs in approximately half of all CML patients who cease TKI therapy. The lack of overt relapse in such patients has been attributed to immunological control of CML. In this review, we discuss an immunological timeline to successful TFR, focusing on the immunology of CML during TKI treatment; an initial period of immune suppression, limiting antitumor immune effector responses in newly diagnosed CML patients, linked to an expansion of immature myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells and aberrant expression of immune checkpoint signaling pathways, including programmed death-1/programmed death ligand-1. Commencement of TKI treatment is associated with immune system re-activation and restoration of effector-mediated [natural killer (NK) cell and T cell] immune surveillance in CML patients, albeit with differing frequencies in concert with differing levels of molecular response achieved on TKI. DMR is associated with maximal restoration of immune recovery in CML patients on TKI. Current data suggest a net balance between both the effector and suppressor arms of the immune system, at a minimum involving mature, cytotoxic CD56d""n NK cells may be important in mediating TFR success. However, a major goal remains in CML to identify the most effective pathways to target to maximize an advantageous immune response and promote TFR success.",33
"The objective of this study was to prospectively compare the incidence of pin tract infection in pediatric supracondylar humerus fractures managed with pin care daily or every other day or weekly. We hypothesized that there were some differences between these three methods. From June 2012 to May 2015, 135 children with supracondylar humerus fractures were randomized to postoperative pin care by cleaning pin tracts daily (group A, 45 cases) or cleaning every 2 days (group B, 45 cases) or cleaning weekly (group C, 45 cases). The three groups were comparable with respect to age, gender, affected side, body mass index (BMI), fracture type, injury to surgery time, number of intraoperative percutaneous pinning, and follow-up time. We collected data on pin retention time, union time, and pin tract infection. The average follow-up time of group A was 4.5 +/- 1.3 and 4.2 +/- 1.6 months in group B and 4.3 +/- 1.4 months in group C. The patient demographics and intraoperative variables of three groups were comparable. No significant difference between these three groups was found in union time and pin fixation time. Of the 135 children, 48 (35.6%) cases had pin tract infection. Grade I infections (Checketts-Otterburns classification) occurred around 28.9% of 270 pin and grade II around 6.7%. We found no differences between three groups as regards frequency and severity of pin tract infections (both P >0.05). However, complain of pain was more frequent in group A than other two groups (P < 0.05). Conclusions: All of the three methods were effective for the management of pin site infection in pediatric supracondylar humerus fractures. However, excessive frequent care as well as pin care daily had the disadvantages of child's fear and parental anxiety.",108
"When we communicate face to face, we subconsciously engage our whole body to convey our message. In telecommunication, e.g. during phone calls, this powerful information channel cannot be used. Capturing nonverbal information from body motion and transmitting it to the receiver parallel to speech would make these conversations feel much more natural. This requires a sensing device that is capable of capturing different types of movements, such as the flexion and extension of joints, and the rotation of limbs. In a first embodiment, we developed a sensing glove that is used to control a computer game. Capacitive dielectric elastomer (DE) sensors measure finger positions, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) detects hand roll. These two sensor technologies complement each other, with the IMU allowing the player to move an avatar through a three-dimensional maze, and the DE sensors detecting finger flexion to fire weapons or open doors. After demonstrating the potential of sensor fusion in human-computer interaction, we take this concept to the next level and apply it in nonverbal communication between humans. The current fingerspelling glove prototype uses capacitive DE sensors to detect finger gestures performed by the sending person. These gestures are mapped to corresponding messages and transmitted wirelessly to another person. A concept for integrating an IMU into this system is presented. The fusion of the DE sensor and the IMU combines the strengths of both sensor types, and therefore enables very comprehensive body motion sensing, which makes a large repertoire of gestures available to nonverbal communication over distances.",64
"In order to research on the application of nano-concrete to reduce roughness coefficient, and considering that roughness coefficient and calculating it are fundamental issues in hydraulic engineering. Also, analyzing the correct evaluation of flow rate and interaction with other hydraulic parameters such as velocity, shape and type of section, and flow pattern, is one of the most important problems in fluid mechanics, and considering that the possibility of minimizing roughness on designing of hydraulic structures and irrigation networks in order to increase velocity and then the flow rate at different sections, are subjects which have been noted by researches and industrial entrepreneurs since years ago. the author of the article had done a series of experiments, the effects of using silicate nano-particles in the floor coating of the channels have been studied in a hydraulic laboratory flume. Through this experimental research, we could had known that adding Nano-Silicate to the concrete mixture will cause the active SiO2 to mix with the free calcium hydroxide available in the micro holes of the concrete and produce unsolved calcium silicate, and eventually cause the structure of the cement to become more dense and become less penetrable causing the concrete to be more resistant. By using this product, we can produce smooth and homogenous surfaces in the upper surface that can increase the flow rate and velocity of fluid in channels, clarifiers and crests of dams.",103
"Following recent progress in super-resolution microscopy in the past decade, massive amounts of redundant single stochastic trajectories are now available for statistical analysis. Flows of trajectories of molecules or proteins sample the cell membrane or its interior at very high time and space resolution. Several statistical analyses were developed to extract information contained in these data, such as the biophysical parameters of the underlying stochastic motion to reveal the cellular organization. These trajectories can further reveal hidden subcellular organization. We review here the statistical analysis of these trajectories based on the classical Langevin equation, which serves as a model of trajectories. Parametric and nonparametric estimators are constructed by discretizing the stochastic equations, and they allow the recovery of tethering forces, diffusion tensors, or membrane organization from measured trajectories that differ from physical ones by a localization noise. Modeling, data analysis, and automatic detection algorithms serve to extract novel biophysical features such as potential wells and other substructures, such as rings, at an unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. It is also possible to reconstruct the surface membrane of a biological cell from the statistics of projected random trajectories.",31
"Solar-driven water splitting promises a step towards large-scale solar energy storage. However, the bottleneck is always the poor performance of the used photoanodes, particularly in their capability to harvest the visible light. Herein, we report the design of visible-light active anatase titanium dioxide nanocrystals (sub 10 nm in size and with a surface area of similar to 99 m(2)/g) using the sol-gel method followed by hydrothermal treatment with H2O2 at relatively low temperature (180 degrees C). The fabricated nanocrystals demonstrate a band gap of 2.85 eV, with an increased amount of surface defects that overcome the negative effects of bulk defects as revealed by the positron annihilation measurements. These prepared nanocrystals have notable enhancement in solar light harvesting and water splitting efficiency compared to the commercial Degussa P25 counterpart. The photoactivity, structural and electrochemical behavior of the synthesized nanocrystals were investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photocurrent measurements, photoluminescence (PL), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), positron annihilation, and Doppler broadening analysis.

"This article deals with research of Russian university student attitudes toward drug use. Research was conducted in 2015; and, 150 students from Smolensk universities took part. The sample consists of three age groups of students: 17-18, 19, and 20 years and older. Study results show students view people with addiction in a negative context - weak, stupid, unreliable, and unhappy. Also, attitudes reflect support for extreme punishment of drug traffickers for drug distribution blaming Roma ""Gypsies."" Age of the student respondents was a significant factor affecting attitudes - older students have a more negative attitude about people with addiction and are more inclined to call for harsh punishment. Study results provide usable information for drug policy, education and prevention efforts in Russia.",104
"Octamer 4 (Oct4), a member of the Pit-Oct-Unc transcription factor family required to maintain self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells, has been previously identified to be associated with tumorigenesis and malignant transformation of numerous types of cancer including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The present data shows that Oct4 enhances cancer stem cell properties and increases invasion ability in the Huh7 cell line. To increase understanding of the role of Oct4 in HCC, the present study used a functional genomics approach and analyzed the resulting transcriptional profiles to identify Oct4-dependent genes in Huh7. Affymetrix GeneChip Human genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays were used to determine differential gene expression profiles and then validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The present study found that altered expression of 673 genes (fold-change >= 2) affected multiple signaling pathways linked with self-renew and metastasis. Among these differentially expressed genes, the present study noticed that the key component of the WNT signaling pathway lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF1) and Twist Family BHLH transcription factor 1 were upregulated by Oct4, whilst cadherin 2 was downregulated. Additional studies found that the nuclear beta-catenin aggregation was increased in Oct4 overexpressed HCC cell lines. These results suggest that Oct4 regulates LEF1 to active LEF1/beta-catenin dependent WNT signaling pathway and promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The present findings provide novel mechanistic insight into an important role of Oct4 in HCC.",37
"This work attempts to reduce component count in Low, High, and All Pass active Filters. It also uses a lower order filter to achieve same results as higher order ones in terms of the frequency response. The optimizers used are Nelder-Mead, GA and PSO. The filters are transformed into small signal analysis while nodal analysis is used to translate a circuit to matrix form. Three different examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach. Results have revealed that with a computer program, a lower order operational amplifier filter can be used to achieve same results as a higher order one. Also, PSO can achieve the best results as regard frequency response for the three examples, followed by GA while Nelder-Mead has the worst result.",60
"Advances in the knowledge of acromegaly are leading to an increase in the survival rate of acromegalic subjects. This study was conducted to evaluate balance control, risk of falls, and peripheral muscle function in acromegalic older adults. Seventeen older subjects with acromegaly (67 [63-73] years) and 20 paired control subjects were evaluated with balance scales, force platform, and knee isokinetic dynamometry tests. There were significant differences between the groups on several balance and gait scales, with a worse performance and greater risk of falls in the acromegalic older adults. Acromegalic older adults had lower values for peak torque, maximum repetition of the total work, and total work during extension at 240 degrees/s. The acromegalic older adults had higher values in the medial-lateral range. Acromegaly subjects had lateral instability that compromises their body balance and increases the risk of falls. Moreover, there was a propensity for muscle fatigue in these individuals.",15
"One of the easiest ways to induce illusory memories in the laboratory is to use the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) word-list paradigm. Researchers have used this paradigm not only to study people's memories of stimuli that were not actually presented, but also to study the phenomenological qualities of these illusions. In four experiments, the current investigation explored a phenomenological quality of illusory memories that has received almost no attention, specifically, temporality. A serial position task was incorporated into the DRM paradigm to examine temporal attributes of participants' true and false memories. Effects of list strength, presentation order, and types of warnings were examined. Results showed consistent serial position responses for true and false memories. However, only responses for illusory memories were affected by manipulations at study. The current findings thus lend support to encoding-based explanations of false recollections.",78
"Two vignette studies were conducted in which preadolescent children (Study 1: N = 542; Study 2: N = 137; aged 8-13 years) evaluated the exclusion, for unknown reasons, of an immigrant minority child by a native majority peer (majority interethnic exclusion). Study 1 compared children's evaluations of majority interethnic exclusion with their evaluations of (majority and minority) intraethnic exclusion and minority interethnic exclusion, and Study 2 examined children's underlying explanations. Each study compared ethnic majority and ethnic minority respondents and examined the role of in-group bias for the former. Overall, both ethnic majority and ethnic minority respondents regarded majority interethnic exclusion more negatively than the other exclusion types (majority intraethnic, minority interethnic, and minority intraethnic). All children, but especially older minority respondents, were more likely to reject majority interethnic exclusion if they perceived it to be discriminatory (ethnicity based). Among the majority children, a strong in-group bias was associated with a weaker condemnation of majority interethnic exclusion, but this was not due to a larger tolerance of ethnicity-based discrimination. Biased majority children were also less likely to reject minority intraethnic exclusion, indicating an overall weaker concern for out-group victims. Taken together, the studies show that children are relatively negative about majority (prototypical) interethnic exclusion because it implies the possibility of ethnic discrimination, and they concur with previous evidence for a developmental increase in the awareness of discrimination in ethnic minority youths.

"Nowadays the most serious security problems are imperfection in the implementations of network protocols. This imperfection can bring a lot of vulnerabilities such as could allow malicious user to attack the systems remotely using the network protocols over the internet. That is why developers value software security phases involving review of code, risk analysis, testing with penetration, and Fuzzing. In case of Fuzz testing, the main aim is to find vulnerabilities in the software/application by sending inputs which are not expected to the target. Then they monitor the situation of the target. Many applications in Internet of things (IoT) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things"" TargetType) environments are working with File Transfer Protocol (FTP) based applications. In this study, we present a fuzzing framework, which is applied to test network protocol implementations. It is extendable, man-in-the-middle, smart, and mostly deterministic. Our tool, like AutoFuzz (Gorbunov and Rosenbloom in AutoFuzz: automated network protocol fuzzing framework, Department of Mathematical and Computation Sciences, University of Toronto Mississauga, Canada L5L 1C6, 2010), has the ability to learn a given protocol implementation by building a finite state automaton from records of communication traces between a client and the server. Additionally, this tool has the ability to learn syntax of individual messages at a lower level using the techniques of bioinformatics (Beddoe in Network protocol analysis using bioinformatics algorithms, http://www.4tphi.net/awalters/PI/pi.pdf). At last, this framework can fuzz a given server protocol specification by changing the communication traces between the server and client. We applied it to multiple implementations of FTP server, with result of finding new and known vulnerabilities.",42
"Many studies have aimed to characterize pressurized transient hydraulics. However, it remains difficult to assess the importance of dynamic effects in a robust manner, and modeling is further complicated by the tension between computational efficiency and physical accuracy. To address such challenges for incompressible flows, this article presents an adaptive modeling approach that combines a novel hybrid formulation, termed the hybrid global gradient algorithm (HGGA), with a variable time step (VTS). The HGGA combines the generalized and rigid water column global gradient algorithms, so it can adapt to inertially-dominated flows and those without such effects. Computational efficiency and physical accuracy are balanced by adjusting the formulation according to the simulated hydraulics. Three physically-based indicators are then introduced to characterize unsteady flow: these actively inform the HGGA of how to model a system. Two pipe networks are used to demonstrate the current work. The first illustrates the utility of the inertial indicators, and the second comprises an extended period simulation with the VTS scheme. Although more computationally intensive than conventional modeling, the methodology is shown to provide a better representation of dynamic hydraulics.",83
"This study was to evaluate the permeable pavement constructed topdown by porous asphalt, compacted natural grading base materials, in-situ soil blended with coarse sand, and geotextile with crushed gravel. The permeable pavement was paved on the field testing site where it was installed a rainfall simulation device to control the intensity of rainfall. The coefficient of permeability and water content for each layer were collected as well as the volumetric water of infiltration and surface run-off Test results show that the permeability of surface layer was degrading severely after nine years in service, while base and subbase remained functional. While rainfall simulation of 124 mm/hr performed, the permeable pavement can retain 0.2139 m(3) of water with infiltration and surface run-off measured by 0.4665 m(3) and 0.1413 m(3), respectively. The analysis of flood peak present that permeable pavement can delay the occurrence of flood peak generated by the surface run-off and ease it quickly by continuous infiltration.",93
"Objectives: The objective of this study was to identify psychosocial predictors of comorbid eating disorders (EDs) in individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 140 people with diabetes answered an online survey covering sociodemographic information, body esteem, restrictive eating, medication omission, coping styles and depressive symptoms. Participants were recruited through advertisements on more than 100 websites, including forums, community organizations and Facebook groups focusing on either diabetes or EDs. Recruitment took place in Canada, Europe, Australia and the United States. Results: On average, EDs developed after diabetes diagnoses in participants with type 1 diabetes but prior to diabetes diagnosis in participants with type 2 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, avoidance coping styles and depressive symptoms predicted an additional diagnosis of EDs. Co-occurring EDs and type 2 diabetes were predicted by body mass indexes and task-oriented coping strategies. Conclusions: Variables potentially influencing the development of EDs in people with diabetes differ according to the type of diabetes, body mass indexes, coping styles and depressive symptoms; they should be more systematically evaluated and closely monitored. In the context of diabetes management, prevention strategies for ED onset based on increased knowledge of the risk factors associated with EDs are necessary and could help decrease the risk for the health complications of diabetes.

"Remarkable progress in understanding the pathophysiology and underlying mechanisms of hereditary angioedema has led to the development of effective treatment for this disorder. Progress in three separate areas has catalyzed our understanding of hereditary angioedema. The first is the recognition that HAE type I and type II result from a deficiency in the plasma level of functional C1 inhibitor. This observation has led to a detailed understanding of the SERPING1 mutations responsible for this deficiency as well as the molecular regulation of C1 inhibitor expression and function. The second is that the fundamental cause of swelling is enhanced contact system activation leading to increased generation of bradykinin. Substantial progress has been made in defining the parameters regulating bradykinin generation and catabolism as well as the receptors that transduce the biologic effects of kinins. The third is the understanding that tissue swelling in hereditary angioedema primarily involves the function of endothelial cell adherens junctions. This knowledge is driving increased attention to the role of endothelial biology in determining disease activity in hereditary angioedema. While there has been considerable progress made, large gaps still remain in our knowledge. Important areas that remain poorly understood include the factors that lead to very low plasma functional C1 inhibitor levels, the triggers of contact system activation in hereditary angioedema, and the role of the bradykinin B1 receptor. The phenotypic variability of hereditary angioedema has been extensively documented but never understood. The mechanisms discussed in this chapter likely contribute to this variability. Future progress in understanding these mechanisms should provide new means to improve the diagnosis and treatment of hereditary angioedema.",131

"Adoptive transfer of antigen-specific T cells has been adapted by investigators for treatment of cancer. This technology is becoming popular in the aspects of cell in vitro preparation and T cell proliferation. In addition, it also does well in enhancing immunity effect and reducing cytotoxicity. A major advantage for this adoptive T-cell therapy (ACT) is its ability to efficiently endow patient's T cells with reactivity for tumor antigens through stable or regulated introduction of genes that encode high affinity tumor-targeting T-cell receptors (TCRs) or synthetic chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). To overcome issues of immune tolerance which limit the endogenous adaptive immune response to tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), robust systems for genetic modification and characterization of T cells that express the chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) for redirecting their specificity have been produced. More and more cases have indicated that the CAR-T cells are excellent in cancer treatment. However, they still have many limitations in the treatment of solid malignancies. In addition, the toxicity of CARs T cells is also a serious problem in the CAR therapy as well. At present, the CAR therapy has been developed through four generations. This review thus focuses on the opportunities and challenges facing the CAR-T cells.",33
"Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a potent neurotrophic factor for substantia nigra dopaminergic (DA) neuronal cells. Recent studies have demonstrated that neural cell adhesion molecule functions as a signal transduction receptor for GDNF. The purpose of this study is to reveal whether neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) mediates the protective effects of GDNF on DA neuronal cells and further explore the mechanisms involved. We utilized SH-SY5Y cell line to establish a model of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-injured DA neuronal cells. Lentiviral vectors were constructed to knockdown or overexpress NCAM-140, and a density gradient centrifugation method was employed to separate membrane lipid rafts. 3-(4,5-Dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT), flow cytometric analysis, and western blotting were used to evaluate the protective effects of GDNF. The results showed that GDNF could protect 6-OHDA-injured SH-SY5Y cells via improving cell viability and decreasing the cell death rate and cleaved caspase-3 expression. NCAM-140 knockdown decreased cell viability and increased the cell death rate and cleaved caspase-3 expression, while its overexpression had the opposite effects. Notably, the amount of NCAM-140 located in lipid rafts increased after GDNF treatment. Pretreatment with 2-bromopalmitate, a specific inhibitor of protein palmitoylation, suppressed NCAM-140 translocation to lipid rafts and reduced the NCAM-mediated protective effects of GDNF on injured DA neuronal cells. Our results suggest that GDNF have the protective effects on injured DA cells by influencing NCAM-140 translocation into lipid rafts.",19
"The elaboration of didactic learning units oriented to create methodological advantages for students could be an important effort of the educational process in University. The didactic learning units presented in this paper have the objective of complementing the class notes and the teacher's lectures. In order to improve the quality degree of education, these complements for students have been carried out in this work. The didactic learning units were developed for each topic in some subjects coursed in the Defense University Center of Marin (Spain) for the subject of Materials Engineering. The units try to simplify and to streamline the learning curve of the student. All of them have a common structure and explain the basic principles of the topic. At the beginning of document, the competencies of Bologna Process contained in each educational unit are detailed. Moreover, theoretical explanations about the topic are supplemented with several schemes and figures, which provide a clear view of all contents. Furthermore, they include a kind of colour speech balloons whose purpose is to exalt important concepts of the unit thematic. Other type of speech balloons shows anecdotes about lesson, which goal is to generate interest and curiosity by student. At the end of didactic learning units, there is a test with some basic questions to student self-assessment. If the subject allows practical exercises, the didactic learning unit includes some solved problems and several proposed problems. Finally, these educational documents were complemented with ""knowledge pills"", which are videos uploaded in the University network, available for students. In them, the teacher shows a presentation oriented to the educational learning unit presented.",89
"Objective: To review contemporary knowledge of the hCG molecule, its isoforms and the importance of glycosylation. Biologic variants and glycoforms of hCG have different biological activities and functions related to the control of menstrual cycle, conception, gestation as well as gynaecologic and non-gynaecologic malignancies.

"Rich ecotype collections are used for several plant models to unravel the molecular causes of phenotypic differences, and to investigate the effects of environmental adaption and acclimation. For the model moss Physcomitrella patens collections of accessions are available, and have been used for phylogenetic and taxonomic studies, for example, but few have been investigated further for phenotypic differences. Here, we focus on the Reute accession and provide expression profiling and comparative developmental data for several stages of sporophyte development, as well as information on genetic variation via genomic sequencing. We analysed cross-technology and cross-laboratory data to define a confident set of 15 mature sporophyte-specific genes. We find that the standard laboratory strain Gransden produces fewer sporophytes than Reute or Villersexel, although gametangia develop with the same time course and do not show evident morphological differences. Reute exhibits less genetic variation relative to Gransden than Villersexel, yet we found variation between Gransden and Reute in the expression profiles of several genes, as well as variation hot spots and genes that appear to evolve under positive Darwinian selection. We analyzed expression differences between the ecotypes for selected candidate genes in the GRAS transcription factor family, the chalcone synthase family and in genes involved in cell wall modification that are potentially related to phenotypic differences. We confirm that Reute is a P.patens ecotype, and suggest its use for reverse-genetics studies that involve progression through the life cycle and multiple generations.",34
"Analog multipliers are one of the most important building blocks in analog signal processing circuits. The performance with high linearity and wide input range is usually required for analog four-quadrant multipliers in most applications. Therefore, a highly linear and wide input range four-quadrant CMOS analog multiplier using active feedback is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a novel configuration of four-quadrant multiplier cell is presented. Its input dynamic range and linearity are improved significantly by adding two resistors compared with the conventional structure. Then based on the proposed multiplier cell configuration, a four-quadrant CMOS analog multiplier with active feedback technique is implemented by two operational amplifiers. Because of both the proposed multiplier cell and active feedback technique, the proposed multiplier achieves a much wider input range with higher linearity than conventional structures. The proposed multiplier was fabricated by a 0.6 mu m CMOS process. Experimental results show that the input range of the proposed multiplier can be up to 5.6V(pp) with 0.159% linearity error on VX and 4.8V(pp) with 0.51% linearity error on VY for +/- 2.5V power supply voltages, respectively.",52
"The goal of ubiquitous computing is to create ambience in which one's experiences and quality of life are improved by monitoring and assisting people using ubiquitous technologies and computation in coherence. The continuous advancements of involved technologies, such as wireless communications, mobile devices, and sensors, imply fast evolution of ubiquitous computing environments too. The complexity of these environments is reaching a point where traditional solutions simply no longer work. The environments are in need of computational techniques that can deal with the evolution and uncertainty of ubiquitous computing environments dynamically and automatically. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can contribute towards satisfying this future scenario in many ways, while numerous approaches inspired by work in the AI planning community have already been designed for ubiquitous computing. We devote this study to investigate the current progress of AI planning for ubiquitous computing by analysing those approaches. We rigorously search for and select relevant literature out of which we extract qualitative information. Using the extracted qualities, we derive a generic framework that consists of aspects important to planning for ubiquitous computing. The framework's main purpose is to facilitate the understanding of those aspects, and classify the literature according to them. We then analyse the literature in a consolidated way, and identify future challenges of planning for ubiquitous computing.",92
"The supramolecular interaction of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug molecules with macrocyclic hosts is one of the interesting areas of research. In this study the interaction of Indomethacin and Acemetacin with macrocyclic cucurbit[7]uril in aqueous medium is reported. The supramolecular interaction of the drug molecules with macrocyclic host have been studied by using the steady state absorption, fluorescence, time resolved fluorescence emission spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry. The modulation of spectral features of the drug molecules on addition of cucurbit[7]uril indicates that the interaction takes place between the drug molecules with cucurbitl[7]uril, respectively. Indomethacin and Acemetacin form 1:1 complex with cucurbit[7]uril. The binding strength and stoichiometry of the drug molecules with cucurbit[7]uril have been estimated by using fluorescence and isothermal titration calorimetry measurements, respectively. The driving forces involved for the complexation of both the drug molecules with cucurbitr[7]uril have been obtained from isothermal titration calorimetry measurement. This study will be helpful to get the knowledge about the modulation of photophysical properties of the studied drugs on addition of macrocyclic host cucurbit[7]uril. The changes in thermodynamic properties due to the complexation of the drug molecules with cucurbit[7]uril help to understand about the governing parameters involved in this complexation. This study will be helpful for the use of cucurbit[7]uril as a potential drug delivery system. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",88
"Background: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the leading causes of chronic liver disease worldwide with tremendous clinical burden. The economic burden of NAFLD is not well studied. Goal: To assess the economic burden of NAFLD. Study: Medicare beneficiaries (January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010) with NAFLD diagnosis by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes in the absence of other liver diseases were selected. Inpatient and outpatient resource utilization parameters were total charges and total provider payments. NAFLD patients with compensated cirrhosis (CC) were compared with decompensated cirrhosis (DC). Results: A total of 976 inpatients and 4742 outpatients with NAFLD were included-87% were white, 36% male, 30% had cardiovascular disease (CVD) or metabolic syndrome conditions, and 12% had cirrhosis. For inpatients, median total hospital charge was $36,289. NAFLD patients with cirrhosis had higher charges and payments than noncirrhotic NAFLD patients ($61,151 vs. $33,863 and $18,804 vs. $10,146, P < 0.001). Compared with CC, NAFLD patients with DC had higher charges and payments (P < 0.02). For outpatients, median total charge was $9,011. NAFLD patients with cirrhosis had higher charges and payments than noncirrhotic NAFLD patients ($12,049 vs. $8,830 and $2,586 vs. $1,734, P < 0.001). Compared with CC, DC patients had higher total charges ($15,187 vs. $10,379, P = 0.04). In multivariate analysis, variables associated with increased inpatient resource utilization were inpatient mortality, DC, and CVD; for outpatients, having CVD, obesity, and hypertension (all P < 0.001). Conclusions: NAFLD is associated with significant economic burden to Medicare. Presence of cirrhosis and CVD are associated with increased resource utilization.",8
"With an increasing amount of volatile renewable electrical energy, the balancing of demand and supply becomes more and more demanding. Demand response is one of the emerging tools in this new landscape. Targeting service sector buildings, we investigated a tariff driven demand response model as a means to shave electrical peak loads and thus reducing grid balancing energy. In this paper is presented a software framework for load shifting which uses a tariff signal for the electric energy as minimization target. The framework can be used both on top of an existing building management system to shift heat generation towards low-tariff times, as well as to simulate load shifting for different buildings, heat pumps and storage configurations. Its modular architecture allows us to easily replace optimizers, weather data providers or building management system adapters. Our results show that even with the current TOU tariff system, up to 34% of cost savings and up to 20% reduction in energy consumption can be achieved. With Sub-MPC, a modifiedMPCoptimizer, we could reduce computing times by a factor 50, while only slightly affecting the quality of the optimization.

"This paper seeks to contribute to the green building debate in economics and management by focusing on environmental innovation and innovation leadership. The latter is the dynamic capability of an innovative firm to seize new innovation opportunities as a result of a proactive investment policy and enhanced innovativeness. The paper defends the thesis according to which firms that are consistently ""innovation leaders"" are those that encourage environmental innovations. We use French CIS Surveys and employ a Heckman selection estimation method using a sample of 1180 firms to study which different forms of innovation leadership increase the propensity to develop environmental innovations. We find a strong impact of innovation leadership that is measured in a novel way, using innovation persistence. Furthermore, the results show a strong impact of regulations and costs savings as determinants of eco-innovation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",99
"Carrier transport in GaAs-based vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) is investigated by means of an in-house multiphysics code, with particular emphasis on the description of many valley effects in the conduction band of AlGaAs barriers. These effects, which are revealed to have a significant impact on the overall VCSEL performance, are accounted for by an effective density of states obtained with a closed-form model. This description has been included in a simplified simulation framework, where most of the distributed Bragg reflector pairs are replaced by an equivalent homogeneous layer. This leads to a major reduction of the computational cost, especially important in view of the computer-aided design of 3D devices.",82
"An initially wet contact filter paper test (IW-CFPT) and an initially dry contact filter paper test (ID-CFPT) were used to examine the wetting paths of geosynthetic clay liners, including non-contact filter paper tests for comparative purposes. The CFPTs were applied to both geosynthetic clay liner faces to examine the effect of geotextile type on capillary contact. The non-woven geotextile face was found to be more likely to cause capillary breaks than the woven geotextile face. Both IW- and ID-CFPTs were found to be applicable to geosynthetic clay liners within their accurate upper matric suction measurement limits of 146 kPa and 66 kPa, respectively.",93
"Partitioning geometric data into two sets, one corresponding to high frequencies and the other to low frequencies, is a critical operation in the second generation wavelet multiresolution analysis. From a geometric point of view, a region with high variability within a vertex neighborhood at a certain scale indicates a correlation with a signal having a frequency that dominates at that scale. We thus prospect the abilities of several geometric variability descriptors to robustly identify features. We consider three descriptor families: based on principal component analysis, surface fitting and quadric error metrics. To assess the quality of each descriptor, we employ a lazy wavelet simplification of digitized 3D models since these usually contain noisy geometric structures from which multiple scales of resolutions can be inferred. The difference between a simplified model and the highest resolution representation is measured objectively using averaged local distance functions.",79
"Piezoelectric actuators are used successfully to enable locomotion of micro-robot such as micro air vehicle with flapping wings. However, the use of piezoelectric actuators presents a major challenge for power electronic design: the input capacitance of such devices makes their use delicate because the instantaneous power may be much greater than the average effective power. Due to this challenge, conventional drive circuits, especially inductor, become too bulky or inefficient in low mass applications. This work describes a converter suitable to drive this kind of actuators with low inductor. Moreover the converter provides for recovery of the energy stored on the actuator capacitance back to the primary power supply when the actuator is not supply. The proposed converter is a DC/AC structure, which is capable of producing a square unipolar AC voltage. In our design, an auxiliary shunt circuits are connected to the actuator. Signal flow graph modeling, analysis and design of such a scheme is presented. Experimental validations have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed technique for recovery energy.",56
"BackgroundMass cytometry measures 36 or more markers per cell and is an appealing platform for comprehensive phenotyping of cells in human tissue and tumor biopsies. While tissue disaggregation and fluorescence cytometry protocols were pioneered decades ago, it is not known whether established protocols will be effective for mass cytometry and maintain cancer and stromal cell diversity. MethodsTissue preparation techniques were systematically compared for gliomas and melanomas, patient derived xenografts of small cell lung cancer, and tonsil tissue as a control. Enzymes assessed included DNase, HyQTase, TrypLE, collagenase (Col) II, Col IV, Col V, and Col XI. Fluorescence and mass cytometry were used to track cell subset abundance following different enzyme combinations and treatment times. ResultsMechanical disaggregation paired with enzymatic dissociation by Col II, Col IV, Col V, or Col XI plus DNase for 1h produced the highest yield of viable cells per gram of tissue. Longer dissociation times led to increasing cell death and disproportionate loss of cell subsets. Key markers for establishing cell identity included CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD64, HLA-DR, CD11c, CD56, CD44, GFAP, S100B, SOX2, nestin, vimentin, cytokeratin, and CD31. Mass and fluorescence cytometry identified comparable frequencies of cancer cell subsets, leukocytes, and endothelial cells in glioma (R=0.97), and tonsil (R=0.98). ConclusionsThis investigation establishes standard procedures for preparing viable single cell suspensions that preserve the cellular diversity of human tissue microenvironments.

"Objectives: This study aimed to assess head and neck cancer patient satisfaction with the use of a touch-screen computer patient-completed questionnaire for assessing Adult Co-morbidity Evaluation 27 co-morbidity scores prior to treatment, along with its clinical reliability. Methods: A total of 96 head and neck cancer patients were included in the audit. An accurate Adult Co-morbidity Evaluation 27 co-morbidity score was achieved via patient-completed questionnaire assessment for 97 per cent of participants. Results: In all, 96 per cent of patients found the use of a touch-screen computer acceptable and would be willing to use one again, and 62 per cent would be willing to do so without help. Patients were more likely to be willing to use the computer again without help if they were aged 65 years or younger (X-2 test; p = 0.0054) or had a performance status of 0 or 1 (X-2 test; p = 0.00034). Conclusion: Use of a touch-screen computer is an acceptable approach for assessing Adult Co-morbidity Evaluation 27 scores at pre-treatment assessment in a multidisciplinary joint surgical-oncology clinic.",69
"At least since 1980, there has been a practically continuous, but somewhat fragmented discussion on the relevance of management research. This discussion has addressed practically all fields of management; here, besides general management, operations management, project management and construction management are examined in more detail. Although many different proposals have been made to rectify the situation, no definitive resolution has been found. In this paper, it is argued that prior analyses have not reached the root causes of the irrelevance problem. By an analysis of the recent history of management research, the following novel findings are reached. First, the root cause of the irrelevance is argued to lie in the 1959 reports on American business education, written by Pierson and Gordon & Howell. Second, while the proposed direction in the 1959 reports was deficient in several ways, the rejection of production as an integral part of organizations and management has been perhaps the most damaging feature of those reports. Third, current research on management suffers from a variety of immediate causes for irrelevance, insufficiently recognized by the scholarly community. It is suggested that reaching the root causes for irrelevance will facilitate finding suitable cures.",102
"Viral load monitoring for hepatitis C virus (HCV) is necessary to diagnose infection and monitor response to therapy, but the tests involved are currently confined to specialist institutions. There is a need for a fast, accurate assay with limited operator input to enhance the access to viral load monitoring. We evaluated the quantification of HCV RNA in serum and plasma by the Cepheid Xpert HCV Viral Load assay in comparison to the Abbott RealTime HCV assay. Serum and plasma samples were gathered from HCV-infected individuals at four international sites. These were tested with the Xpert HCV Viral Load assay, and results were compared to quantification by the Abbott RealTime HCV assay. An external quality assessment panel of eight samples was also tested. In total, 614 samples were analyzed in the study, and the qualitative results agreed on the two platforms for 588 (95.8%) samples. Further analysis of 396 samples quantified by both tests showed strong correlation (correlation coefficient r = 0.99) across the quantifiable range, with Bland-Altman plot data showing a mean difference (+/- 1.96 standard deviation) of 0.03 +/- 0.44 log(10) IU/ml. In the external quality assessment panel, the Xpert HCV Viral Load assay results (quantified in log(10) IU per milliliter) were within 1 standard deviation of the target value for all but one sample, which was also similarly misquantified by the Abbott RealTime HCV assay. The Xpert HCV Viral Load assay performs well compared to a market-leading HCV viral load test and should be considered for instances where rapid near-to-patient testing is required.",130
"This research paper reports on the utilization of the hydrogel of gelatine (GL) and its hybrid nanocomposite with clinoptilolite for the adsorption of Cd2+ ions from an aqueous solution and multi metal ions from mine effluents. The hydrogel was synthesized using the graft co-polymerization of acrylamide (AAm) onto GL and the hybrid hydrogel nanocomposite was prepared by incorporating clinoptilolite within the hydrogel matrix. The synthesized polymers were characterized using different characterization techniques such as FTIR, XRD, SEM and TGA. The adsorption behaviour of the synthesized adsorbents for the adsorption of Cd2+ was studied using different adsorption parameters such as pH, temperature and adsorbent dosage. Adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order rate equation, whereas, the adsorption isotherm followed both the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models. The thermodynamics studies revealed that the adsorption processes were spontaneous and endothermic in nature. Moreover, the synthesized adsorbents were also successfully utilized for the adsorption of different metal ions from the mine effluents.

"Many studies up to date have implied that biases in the metacognition of memory, so called metamemory, contribute to the development and maintenance of positive symptoms in schizophrenia. However, no study exists which has longitudinally followed patients experiencing positive symptoms. The present article therefore reviews cross-sectional studies on retrospective metamemory abilities in participants within different stages of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder, with heterogeneous symptom severities, creating a pseudo-longitudinal overview. Summarized, a deterioration of these abilities correlating with psychosis development can be inferred. The reviewed publications indicate that metamemory biases can already be found in patients with an at-riskmental state for psychosis (ARMS). Patients in their first episode of psychosis (FEP) seem to be more severely impaired than ARMS-patients but similarly affected compared to chronic patients. The contribution of these biases to the pathogenesis of psychosis is discussed, giving consideration to relations with other cognitive-and metacognitive functions, neurochemical processes and neural correlates. It is hypothesized that the biases represent early cognitive markers of the beginning and persisting psychotic state. An early treatment program could help patients to ameliorate the general course of illness or even to prevent the risk of a transition to psychosis.",78
"This paper proposed a universal method for implementing PTP (Precision Time Protocol) for test systems with the 1000M Ethernet Interface. To achieve the synchronization accuracy of sub-microsecond, the configurable real-time clock and the time stamp module were realized in the programmable logic which makes the PHY and MAC to be free of time stamp functions in the communication link. PTPd (Precision Time Protocol deamon, an open source implementation) was modified and transplanted into the embedded Linux system to realize PTP state machine while the IEEE 1588 IP core device driver was developed to provide the application layer with access to the accurate time-stamp obtained in link layer by IEEE 1588 IP core. This project structure makes the transplantation process concentrate on the time adjustment algorithm design in the application layer regardless of obtaining a precise time stamp in the hardware. The proposed method was evaluated on the Xilinx Zynq-7000 SOC platform by outputting PPS (Pulse Per Second) which can verify the synchronization accuracy of all nodes (master and slaves) in the network. After quantifying the accuracy and stability of the synchronization offset, we concluded that clock frequency offset and network transmission delay are the main influence factors for synchronization and proved the feasibility of maintaining submicrosecond-level synchronization accuracy within multi-level switch topology.",35
"This paper presents an approach to electrical circuits using Hilbert transform. By applying Hilbert transform to linear circuit equations under sinusoidal form, (-pi/2) phase shifting occurs. This method can be extended to complex form circuits analysis. Applications refer strictly to sampled signals, discrete signals. The input signal is a signal under the harmonic form. An application that determines the analysis of two RLC circuits - series respectively series - parallel - powered by a constant sinusoidal current is developed.",45
"In chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), colony-forming units granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM), which grow in vitro in the absence of exogenous growth factors, arise from the abnormal clone that is responsible for the overproduction of granulomonocytic cells. Previous in vitro findings including ours suggest that divergent molecular aberrations in CMML seem to converge within the GM-CSF signaling pathway. As JAK2 is a sentinel kinase in this pathway, JAK2 inhibition may be an attractive treatment approach in CMML. We investigated the in vitro effects of the specific JAK2 inhibitor TG101209 on the autonomous CFU-GM formation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with CMML. TG101209 was found to either block or strongly inhibit spontaneous CFU-GM growth in all 10 patients tested. This inhibitory effect was dose dependent and significantly more pronounced as compared to the inhibitory effect on stimulated CFU-GM growth from normal individuals. In a CMML patient with splenomegaly, who was treated with the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib off label, we can demonstrate a spleen response and the disappearance of constitutional symptoms which was associated with a decrease in autonomous CFU-GM formation ex vivo. Pharmacological JAK2 inhibition may be an interesting approach to be systematically studied in patients with CMML.",12
"This paper focuses on the application of sensitivity analysis (SA) to typical passively designed high-rise residential buildings in hot and humid climates by considering multiple indoor environmental indices and impact factors. The sampling based Monte Carlo Analysis (MCA) is adopted to carry out multiple regression analyses between selected input paranieters and output indices. Input parameters including the building layout, envelope thermophysics, building geometry and infiltration & air-tightness extensively cover each aspect of passive design strategies to improve the sustainability of buildings, while miscellaneous output indices represent major indoor environment factors such as lighting, ventilation and thermal comfort conditions addressed by the local green building guidance. A dynamic simulation program generates all required outputs based on input parameters by constructing a generic building model with different assumptions of internal loads, ventilation control methods, running periods and weather conditions. The calculated sensitivity indices on different output indices chances with simulation control variables, whereas the window solar heat gain coefficient and window to ground ratio are consistently among the most influential design factors. In addition, ASHRAE Adaptive Comfort Standard with 90% Acceptability is determined to be the most adequate assessment method of the building thermal comfort in hot and humid climates similar to Hong Kong. This proposed SA approach accounts for most identified impact factors in a passively designed building and can therefore help conceive potential sustainable solutions in early architectural design stages.",99
"Automated compliance checking (ACC) of building designs requires automated extraction of information from building information models (BIMs). However, current industry foundation classes (IFC)-based BIMs provide limited support for ACC, because they lack the necessary information that is needed to perform compliance checking (CC). In this paper, the authors propose a new method for extending the IFC schema to incorporate CC-related information, in an objective and semiautomated manner. The method utilizes semantic natural language processing techniques and machine learning techniques to extract concepts from documents that are related to CC (e. g., building codes) and match the extracted concepts to concepts in the IFC class hierarchy. The proposed method includes a set of methods/algorithms that are combined into one computational platform: (1) a method for concept extraction that utilizes pattern-matching-based rules to extract regulatory concepts from CC-related regulatory documents; (2) a method for concept matching and semantic similarity assessment to select the most related IFC concepts to the extracted regulatory concepts; and (3) a machine learning classification method for predicting the relationship between the extracted regulatory concepts and their most related IFC concepts. The proposed method enables the extension of the IFC schema, in an objective way, using any construction regulatory document. To test and evaluate the proposed method, two chapters were randomly selected from the International Building Code (IBC) 2006 and 2009. Chapter 12 of IBC 2006 was used for training/development and Chapter 19 of IBC 2009 was used for testing and evaluation. Comparing to manually-developed gold standards, 91.7% F1-measure, 84.5% adoption rate, and 87.9% precision were achieved for regulatory concept extraction, IFC concept selection, and relationship classification, respectively.

"The visibility of retinal microvasculature in optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) images is negatively affected by the small dimension of the capillaries, pulsatile blood flow, and motion artifacts. Serial acquisition and time-averaging of multiple OCT-A images can enhance the definition of the capillaries and result in repeatable and consistent visualization. We demonstrate an automated method for registration and averaging of serially acquired OCT-A images. Ten OCT-A volumes from six normal control subjects were acquired using our prototype 1060-nm swept source OCT system. The volumes were divided into microsaccade-free en face angiogram strips, which were affine registered using scale-invariant feature transform keypoints, followed by nonrigid registration by pixel-wise local neighborhood matching. The resulting averaged images were presented of all the retinal layers combined, as well as in the superficial and deep plexus layers separately. The contrast-to-noise ratio and signal-to-noise ratio of the angiograms with all retinal layers (reported as average +/- standard deviation) increased from 0.52 +/- 0.22 and 19.58 +/- 4.04 dB for a single image to 0.77 +/- 0.25 and 25.05 +/- 4.73 dB, respectively, for the serially acquired images after registration and averaging. The improved visualization of the capillaries can enable robust quantification and study of minute changes in retinal microvasculature. (C) The Authors.

"Introduction: Traits of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) such as impaired ventilatory control, craniofacial abnormalities, and concomitant cardiovascular diseases are associated with modified endothelin-1 gene (EDN-1) or endothelin-receptor-subtype-a (EDNRA) gene. The endothelin system regulates the cardiovascular homeostasis. EDN-1 interacts mainly with EDNRA for signal transduction. In Our study we investigate associations of EDNRA-polymorphisms (four frequent polymorphisms with an allele frequency >5%) and OSAS severity. Methods: Three hundred ninety-three patients older than IS years. of Caucasian origin and with OSAS (AHI >5/h and daytime sleepiness) were investigated by cardiorespiratory polysomnography. In addition 58 control subjects with healthy sleep were recruited from nearly 300 volunteers. We analysed the EDNRA-polymorphisms E335E, H323H, G-231A and G+70C by polymerase-chain-reaction, restriction-fragment-length-polymorphism and real-time-PCR. Results: Carrier of the mutant G-231A allele had a significantly lower AHI (p = 0.03, OR 0.53. 95% CI 0.3-0.94) when comparing patients and controls. When comparing OSAS severity groups Without Controls we could not detect significant correlations for the four investigated EDNRA-polymorphisms. Our data confirm that BMI (p < 0.001) and male gender (p = 0.02) are significantly associated with AHI. The allele frequencies were similar. Discussion: The genetic investigation of OSA remains important. Our control group was relatively small and we investigated 4 reasonable candidates out of more than 100 EDNRA-polymorphisms. The detected protective effect of the Mutant G-231A allele needs further confirmation. Gene based research in OSAS Should use genome wide scan and Should still consider the endothelin system.

"Background: The prognostic role of hypertension on long-term survival after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is limited and inconsistent. We hypothesize that hypertension increases long-term mortality after PCI.Methods: We analyzed data from SCAAR (Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Registry) for all consecutive patients admitted coronary care units in Sweden between January 1995 and May 2013 and who underwent PCI due to ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)/unstable angina (UA) or stable angina pectoris. We used Cox proportional-hazards regression for statistical modelling on complete-case data as well as on imputed data sets. We used interaction test to evaluate possible effect-modulation of hypertension on risk estimates in several pre-specified subgroups: age categories, gender, diabetes, smoking and indication for PCI (STEMI, NSTEMI/UA and stable angina).Results: During the study period, 175,892 consecutive patients underwent coronary angiography due to STEMI, NSTEMI/UA or stable angina. 78,100 (44%) of these had hypertension. Median follow-up was 5.5 years. After adjustment for differences in patient's characteristics, hypertension was associated with increased risk for mortality (HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.09-1.15, p<.001). In subgroup analysis, risk was highest in patients less than 65 years, in smokers and in patients with STEMI. The risk was lowest in patients with stable angina (p<.001 for interaction test).Conclusion: Hypertension is associated with higher mortality in patients with STEMI, NSTEMI/UA or stable angina who are treated with PCI.",120
"In this paper, the authors present the energy production potential of a mechanically-resonant electrical generator system, which makes use of natural human walking movements. The characteristics associated with the human walk will be discussed first, followed by the electromechanical modeling approach employed. The choice of electromechanical architecture will be justified and the permanent magnet and moving coil structure can then be modeled and optimized. A demonstration device has also been generated and tested in order to validate the concept developed as well as the theoretical models derived.",52
"Additive manufacturing technologies enable the fabrication of parts characterized by shape complexity and therefore allow the design of optimized components based on minimal material usage and weight. In the literature two approaches are available to reach this goal: adoption of lattice structures and topology optimization. In a recent work a Computer-Aided method for generative design and optimization of regular lattice structures was proposed. The method was investigated in few configurations of a cantilever beam, considering six different cell types and two load conditions. In order to strengthen the method, in this paper a number of test cases have been carried out. Results explain the behavior of the method during the iterations, and the effects of the load and of the cell dimension. Moreover, a visual comparison between the proposed method and the results achieved by topology optimization is shown.",82
"The static and dynamic characteristics of the EDM machine as the main machining unit directly influence the machining accuracy and stability. For a particular type of the EDM machine, the three-dimensional model was built with SolidWorks and the finite element method was employed with the ANSYS workbench to analyze the static and dynamic characteristics of the machine. The results show that the stiffness of the ram and vertical guide (Z-axis) in the Y and Z directions is the weak side of the machine. The analytical method is proved to be effective for the optimization of the machine design.",85
"Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) traditionally had a low body mass index and microangiopathic complications were common. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, published in 1993, demonstrated that therapy aimed at maintaining HbA1c levels as close to normal as feasible reduced the incidence of microangiopathy. Since then, the use of intensive insulin therapy to optimise metabolic control became generalised, with two main side effects: a higher rate of severe hypoglycaemia and increased weight gain. Approximately 50% of patients with T1DM are currently obese or overweight, which reduces or nullifies the benefits of good metabolic control, and which has other negative consequences; therefore, strategies to achieve weight control in patients with T1DM are necessary. At present, treatment with GLP-1 and SGLT-2 inhibitors has yielded promising short-term results that need to be confirmed in studies with larger numbers of patients and long-term follow-up. It is possible that, in coming years, the applicability of bariatric surgery in obese patients with T1DM will be similar to that of the general population or T2DM.",6
"Background. Giardia intestinalis is the most commonly reported human intestinal parasite in the United States. Increased incidence of chronic gastrointestinal complaints has been reported after some giardiasis outbreaks. We examined the relationship between giardiasis diagnosis and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnosis. Methods. We used the 2006-2010 MarketScan commercial insurance database. Persons with at least 1 giardiasis diagnosis were individually matched on age group, sex, and enrollment length in months to 5 persons without a giardiasis diagnosis. Persons diagnosed with IBS before the date of study entry were excluded. We calculated crude incidence rates (IRs) and developed Cox proportional hazards models. Results. The matched cohort included 3935 persons with giardiasis and 19 663 persons without giardiasis. One-year incidence of IBS was higher in persons with giardiasis (IR = 37.7/1000 person-years vs 4.4/1000 person-years). The unadjusted hazard ratio was 4.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.6-6.4), attenuated slightly to 3.9 (95% CI = 2.9-5.4) after adjusting for anxiety, depression, and healthcare utilization. Conclusions. In a large insurance database, individuals diagnosed with giardiasis were more likely to have a subsequent IBS diagnosis, despite accounting for confounders. Future research on risk factors for IBS among giardiasis patients and the pathophysiology of postinfectious IBS is needed.",4
"A theoretical model is proposed that specifies lay causal theories of behavior; and supporting experimental evidence is presented. The model's basic assumption is that different types of behavior trigger different hypotheses concerning the types of causes that may have brought about the behavior. Seven categories are distinguished that are assumed to serve as both behavior types and explanation types: goals, dispositions, temporary states such as emotions, intentional actions, outcomes, events, and stimulus attributes. The model specifies inference rules that lay people use when explaining behavior (actions are caused by goals; goals are caused by higher order goals or temporary states; temporary states are caused by dispositions, stimulus attributes, or events; outcomes are caused by actions, temporary states, dispositions, stimulus attributes, or events; events are caused by dispositions or preceding events). Two experiments are reported. Experiment 1 showed that free-response explanations followed the assumed inference rules. Experiment 2 demonstrated that explanations which match the inference rules are generated faster and more frequently than non matching explanations. Together, the findings support models that incorporate knowledge based aspects into the process of causal explanation. The results are discussed with respect to their implications for different stages of this process, such as the activation of causal hypotheses and their subsequent selection, as well as with respect to social influences on this process.",63
"Purpose: To evaluate changes in nocturia after surgical correction of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Methods: A total of 66 patients were included in the present study. All had been diagnosed with OSA syndrome by polysomnography and underwent uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP). Preoperative and postoperative lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), quality of life (QoL), and nocturia episodes were evaluated using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS) questionnaires. Three months postoperatively, telephone interviews were performed to determine the success of surgery, current LUTS, and nocturia episodes. Patients were divided into surgical success and failure groups. Surgical success was defined as snoring decrease more than 50% based on the patient's subjective judgment. Results: The response rate was 56% and success rate was 73%. In all patients, nocturia episodes significantly decreased from 1.7 +/- 1.1 to 0.8 +/- 1.2 (P = 0.002). Mean IPSS score, OABSS score, and QoL scores were also significantly improved. The success group showed a significant decrease in nocturia episodes, and total IPSS, OABSS, and QoL scores. However, the failure group did not show significant changes in all parameters. Conclusions: OSA correction improved nocturia as well as other LUTS. These improvements were not observed in the failure group. This study shows that OSA is a cause of nocturia and that other LUTS and nocturia can be improved by surgical correction of OSA.",17
"Under investigation in this paper is a -dimensional Korteweg-de Vries-type equation, which can describe the propagation of nonlinear waves such as the shallow-water waves, surface and internal waves. By virtue of the Bell polynomials, symbolic computation and auxiliary independent variable, the bilinear forms, Backlund transformations and soliton solutions are obtained. Solitonic propagation and elastic collisions between/among the two- and three-solitons are discussed analytically and graphically. It can be seen that, after each collision, solitonic shapes and amplitudes keep invariant except for some phase shifts, and the smaller-amplitude soliton moves faster and overtakes the larger.",24
"We report a case of a 58 years old woman who presented for clinical picture consisting in skin rash, pruritus, astenia, mialgia, with progressive onset during the last month and recently discovered blood hypereosinophilia. The patient was exhaustively investigated and secondary causes for hypereosinophilia were excluded, mainly allergies, parasitic infections, autoimmune and neoplastic diseases. On hospital admission the patient had no symptoms or personal history suggesting cardiac disease. The initial electrocardiography and echocardiography had minimal changes, but cardiac markers such as proBNP and troponin had high values. The clinical evolution was initially good, with moderate dose corticosteroid therapy, but eosinophilia, leukocytosis and cardiac markers continued to increase, followed by progressive cardiac ischemia and ultrasound changes. We considered a rare case of primary hypereosinophilic syndrome with severe cardiac involvement and we switched to high dose corticosteroid followed by add-on therapy with hydroxyurea. Blood eosinophilia decreased, but cardiac markers and ischemia continued to aggravate and unfortunately the patient died due to sudden cardiac arrest, after three weeks from hospital admission. We concluded that hypereosinophilic syndrome with early and progressive cardiac involvement is a severe and difficult to manage disease, with high fatality risk, that requires complex investigations, multidisciplinary approach and prompt therapy.",105
"BackgroundWomen with endometriosis are frequently misdiagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) for some time before a correct diagnosis is made. Visceral hypersensitivity is a key feature in both conditions. AimsTo determine if there are distinct symptom patterns in women with IBS and endometriosis, and to determine the response of these women to a low FODMAP diet in comparison to those with IBS alone. Materials and methodsA retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from women attending a specialist IBS service in Christchurch New Zealand. Data from those who met Rome III criteria for IBS were sorted into two groups: concurrent endometriosis and those with IBS alone. Demographics and symptom patterns were identified from a prospective questionnaire. A low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) diet was taught to all women as the primary therapeutic intervention. Responses to the diet were noted against their ultimate disposition. ResultsOf the 160 women who met Rome III criteria for IBS, 36% had concurrent endometriosis. The presence of dyspareunia (P>0.0001), referred pain (P=0.005), bowel symptoms exacerbated by menstruation (P=0.0004) and a family history of endometriosis (P=0.0003) were associated with concurrent endometriosis. Seventy two percent of these women reported a >50% improvement in bowel symptoms after four weeks of a low FODMAP diet compared with 49% in those with no known endometriosis (P=0.001, odds ratio 3.11, 95% CI, 1.5-6.2). ConclusionsWomen with concurrent endometriosis and IBS report a unique symptom phenotype. The low FODMAP diet appears effective in women with gut symptoms and endometriosis.",4
"Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is a coenzyme involved in the redox-cycling system. The supplemental use of PQQ has been examined based on its properties as an antioxidant and redox modulator. Although an animal study on deficiency of PQQ suggested that PQQ contributes to skin conditions, its efficacy in humans has not been reported. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of orally administered PQQ on skin moisture, viscoelasticity. and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) both in dry skin mouse models and in healthy female subjects with a subjective symptom of dry skin. In our dry skin mouse model study, oral intake of PQQ (0.0089%, w/w, in the diet for 6 wk) significantly decreased the number of mast cells in the dermis and the number of CD3(+) T-cells in the epidermis. In our human study, oral intake of PQQ (20 mg/d for 8 wk) significantly inhibited the increase in TEWL on the forearm. Finally, subject questionnaires showed positive impressions for the improvement of skin conditions. These results suggest that oral intake of PQQ improves skin conditions both in female subjects with dry skin and in mice with a compromised skin barrier function.",114
"The active charge accumulator (ACA) is a pressure converter device in a water-hydraulic system, that is able to increase and decrease pressure without using a pressure-regulating valve. The basic characteristics of ACAs, however, have not yet been sufficiently revealed. In this study, we experimentally examined the basic characteristics of ACAs with focus placed on how ACAs reduce pressure. This examination has revealed that the piston stroke of ACAs depends on the load flow rate as well as the valve switching timing. We theoretically analyzed these phenomena using a mathematical model. With an analytic model built taking into consideration the compressibility of the working fluid, valve performance level, and other elements, we made a comparison between the analytic and experimental results to verify the validity of our analysis. This comparison revealed that the pressure waveforms in the low-pressure and pressure-conversion sections obtained through the analysis agreed with those obtained through the experiments, indicating that the analytic model was valid",83
"Health visitors need competences to promote healthy early parent-infant relationships. The aims of this study were to explore whether there are differences between groups of health visitors with and without additional parenting program education in terms of their knowledge of infant-parent interaction and their observation and assessment skills of such interactions. The cross-sectional study included 36 health visitors' certified Marte Meo therapists and 85 health visitors without additional parenting program education. Health visitors' observation skills were measured assessing five video-recorded mother-infant interactions. A questionnaire was used to measure their intention, self-efficacy, and knowledge. More certified Marte Meo therapists than health visitors without additional parenting program education reported a significantly higher mean level of knowledge of the early relationship, 6.42 (95% CI; 6.18-6.66) versus 5.05 (95% CI; 4.86-6.10), p = .04; and more certified Marte Meo therapists than health visitors without additional parenting program education reported a higher mean level of knowledge of infant self-regulation, 2.44 (95% CI; 2.18-2.71) versus 1.83 (95% CI; 1.62-2.03), p < .001. In the latter group, 54% (95% CI; 0.43-0.64) reported a significantly higher need for further education versus 22% (95% CI; 0.11-0.39), p = .001. Compared to health visitors without any parenting program education, health visitors certified as Marte Meo therapists reported a significantly higher frequency of correct assessment of mothers' sensitivity in two of five video-recordings, with 77.78% (95% CI; 0.61-0.87) compared to 45.88% (95% CI; 0.35-0.57) in Video 3, p = .001, and 69.44% (95% CI; 0.52-0.82) compared to 49.41% (95% CI; 0.39-0.60) in Video 4, p =.04, respectively. The results of the present study support the use of video-based education of health visitors to increase their knowledge of and skills in assessing parent-infant interactions. Randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether the improved level of health visitors' knowledge and observation skills may be assigned to participation in the Marte Meo education program.",18
"Background: Oxidative stress is one of the important factors involved in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The equilibrium of Nuclear factor-erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/[BTB (broad-complex, tramtrack and bric-a-brac) and CNC (cap'n'collar protein) homology 1, Bach1] determines the expression level of antioxidant factors, further regulating the function of oxidation/antioxidation capacity. Pirfenidone (PFD) is one of two currently for IPF therapy approved drugs. PFD regulates intracellular antioxidants, inhibits secretion of inflammatory cytokines and collagen synthesis. However the mechanisms of its antioxidant effects remain elusive. Methods: Effects of PFD treatment were studied in mouse lung fibroblasts (MLF) following induction by transforminggrowth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and in mice following bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. The mRNA and protein levels of oxidative stress-related factors Nrf2/Bach1 and their downstream antioxidant factors heme oxygenase-1 (Ho-1) and glutathione peroxidase 1 (Gpx1) were determined by RT-PCR and Western blot. Fibrosis-related cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and myofibroblast markers type 1 collagen alpha 1 (COL1A1) levels in supernate of MLF, serum, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) in serum and BALF were detected by ELISA, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was measured by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay and lung pathological/morphological alterations in mice were observed by HE and Masson to assess the antioxidant mechanism and therapeutic effects on pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin. Results: PFD inhibited Bach1 mRNA and protein expressions in mouse lung fibroblasts induced by TGF-beta 1 and lung tissues with pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin. Furthermore, it improved Nrf2, Ho-1 and Gpx1 mRNA and protein expressions. After PFD treatment, COL1A1and IL-6 levels in supernate of MLF, serum, and BALF as well as ROS in lung tissues and MDA in serum and BALF from a mouse with pulmonary fibrosis were significantly decreased, and the infiltration of lung inflammatory cells and fibrosis degree were alleviated. Conclusions: Theraputic effects of PFD for IPF were involved in Nrf2/Bach1 equilibrium which regulated the capacity of oxidative stress. The study provided new insights into the antioxidant mechanism of PFD.",3
"The development of transition-state analogs is a major objective in enzymology, not only for developing potent inhibitors of enzymes but also for dissecting enzyme catalytic mechanisms. Phosphinic peptides, which share closed structural similarities with the transition-state of peptide substrate upon hydrolysis, have thus been considered for identifying potent inhibitors of proteases. Focusing on the zinc-proteases family, this review presents the most important synthetic efforts performed to obtain the desired compounds. Crystal structures of the phosphinic peptides in interaction with their zinc-protease targets are reported to illustrate the structural features which may explain the potency of these compounds and how they contribute to uncover key enzyme catalytic residues. Based on a remarkable metabolic stability, phosphinic peptides can be used to probe the in vivo function of zinc-proteases. Progress on chemistry and better understanding on the functional roles of zinc-proteases should allow transferring these compounds from shelf to clinic.",36
"Background: Elevation of fatty acid synthase (FAS) in human cancers is often associated with increased tumor aggression. The basic genetic mechanisms leading to increased enzyme content in cancer cells were investigated using cell lines derived from human metastatic breast carcinomas (T47D, Zr75 and SKBr3) and normal human breast epithelium (184A1). Materials and Methods: Western analysis, Northern blotting, [2-C-14]malonyl-CoA incorporation assays, nuclear run-off transcription assays, mRNA decay assays, and poly(A) tail assays were used to measure and compare transcription rates of the FAS gene among the four cell lines. Results: By Western analysis, FAS levels in T47D were 2.6 times lower than ZR75 and SK-Br3, but 6.7 times greater than non-neoplastic 184A1 cells. FAS mRNA levels and specific activity correlated with protein content. In contrast, relative rates of FAS gene transcription were significantly higher in non-neoplastic 184A1 cells than T47D, ZR75 and SKBr3. Stability of message was investigated to explain this discrepancy. The half-life of FAS mRNA in 184A1 cells was 5.6 h, or 4-5-fold less than ZR75 and SKBr3. Poly(A) tail assays showed that FAS mRNA species from 184A1 cells tended to be longer than those of breast cancer cell lines (500-1500 nt versus 500-800 nt, respectively). Conclusion: Breast cancer cell lines contained significantly more FAS enzyme, message and activity than nonneoplastic 184A1 cells. Yet, 184A1 cells exhibited higher rates of FAS gene activation. The discrepancy is explained by faster decay of FAS message in 184A1 cells, suggesting that stabilization of FAS mRNA plays a major role in overexpression of the protein in breast cancer. Increased stability could not be explained simply by degree of polyadenylation. Therefore, some other mechanism (s) must be responsible for conferring stability to FAS RNA species in breast cancer cells.",38
"Background: Adolescents' sleep duration and subjective psychological well-being are related. However, few studies have examined the relationship between sleep duration and subjective psychological well-being longitudinally across adolescence - a time of profound biological and psychosocial change. The aim of this longitudinal study was to investigate whether shorter sleep duration in adolescents is predictive of lower subjective psychological well-being 6 months and 12 months later or whether lower subjective psychological well-being is predictive of shorter sleep duration. Methods: Adolescents (age range, 10.02-15.99 years; mean age, 13.05 +/- 1.49 years; 51.8%, female) from German-speaking Switzerland (n=886) and Norway (n=715) reported their sleep duration and subjective psychological well-being on school days using self-rating questionnaires at baseline (T1), 6 months (T2), and 12 months from baseline (T3). Results: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses revealed that sleep duration decreased with age. Longer sleep duration was concurrently associated with better subjective psychological well-being. Crossed-lagged autoregressive longitudinal panel analysis showed that sleep duration prospectively predicted subjective psychological well-being while there was no evidence for the reverse relationship. Conclusion: Sleep duration is predictive of subjective psychological well-being. The findings offer further support for the importance of healthy sleep patterns during adolescence.",128
"The ability to exploit emerging exascale computational systems will require a careful review and redesign of core numerical algorithms and their implementations to fully exploit multiple levels of concurrency, hierarchical memory structures and heterogeneous processing units that will become available in these computational platforms. This paper presents the ""unite and conquer"" approach to solve linear systems of equations and eigenvalue problems for extreme scale computing. Indeed, there are two ways to optimize the execution of a restarted method on a large-scale distributed system. The first one is to optimize the number of floating point operations per restart cycle through maximizing the concurrency inside a restart cycle while minimizing latencies. The second-way is to accelerate/improve the rate of convergence for a given computational scheme. The unite and conquer restarted approach focuses on decreasing the number of restart cycles by coupling either synchronously or asynchronously several restarted methods called also co-methods. In the end of a restart cycle, each co-method locally gathers available results of all collaborating co-methods and selects the best one in order to create its restarting information. Consequently this permits the global reduction of the number of cycles to convergence. The unite and conquer restarted methods are heterogeneous, fault tolerant, support asynchronous communications and present a big potential of load balancing. Due to these properties, they are well adapted to large-scale multi-level parallel architectures. We show the relevant programming paradigms that allow multi-level parallel expression of these methods and how the software engineering technology can contribute significantly in achieving high scalability. We present some experiments validating the approach for unite and conquer restarted Krylov methods on several parallel and distributed platforms. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",123
"Objective: To explore the subjective quality of life (QoL) in children with Tourette Syndrome (TS) in China to provide a basis for more effective interference. Method: A total of 107 patients and 107 controls were enrolled. Subjective QoL was investigated by Inventory of Subjective Life Quality, Family Environment Scale of Chinese Version, and the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale, and a case-control study was performed. Results: The total score of subjective QoL and family life, school life, peer relationship, cognitive component, environment, self-awareness, cognitive component and depression experience in the TS were lower than control. Patients with co-morbid exhibited significantly lower scores within the subjective QoL family life, peer relationship, school life, self-awareness, and cognitive affective domains. Conclusion: The subjective QoL is impaired and it is important to control clinical symptoms and improve family environment for the improvement of the subjective QoL in TS.",69
"Proteoglycans (PGs) impact many aspects of kidney health and disease. Models that permit genetic dissection of PG core protein and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) function have been instrumental to understanding their roles in the kidney. Matrix-associated PGs do not serve critical structural roles in the organ, nor do they contribute significantly to the glomerular barrier under normal conditions, but their abnormal expression influences fibrosis, inflammation, and progression of kidney disease. Most core proteins arc dispensable for nephrogenesis (glypican-3 being an exception) and for maintenance of function in adult life, but their loss alters susceptibility to experimental kidney injury. In contrast, kidney development is exquisitely sensitive to GAG expression and fine structure as evidenced by the severe phenotypes of mutants for genes involved in GAG biosynthesis. This article reviews PG expression in normal kidney and the abnormalities caused by their disruption in mice and man.",5
"Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells are a chemically fuelled power supply which generally have a higher energy density than Lithium-Polymer Battery (LIPOs) but a much lower power density. In order for PEM fuel cells to increase the endurance of an in-service battery power supply, without decreasing the peak power, it should be hybridised with a battery. It is key for the market that the overall switch to hybrid technology is low cost in terms of size, weight and money. Hybrid technology tends to be generically designed to suit any power system, using regulators to ensure voltage matching, and diodes to control the direction of electrical flow. Many electric motors are controlled by speed controllers which can regulate the thrust provided by the motor, accounting for fluctuations in voltage usually found in a depleting battery. Using diode and regulator based hybrids for electric motor applications is therefore inherently inefficient even if complicated synchronous DC DC converters are used due to the increased cost, size and weight. This paper demonstrates the ability to use ideal diodes to control the flow of electricity through the hybrid and that voltage regulation is not needed for a motor in this case. Furthermore, this paper explores the natural balancing strategy created by duty cycling the PEM fuel cell to different points within it's polarisation curve, removing the requirement for DC DC converters to match it to the battery voltage. The changes made improve the efficiency of the hybrid power electronics to over 97%. Copyright (C) 2016, The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

"Recovery from acute spinal cord injury (SCI) is characterized by extensive heterogeneity, resulting in uncertain prognosis. Reliable prediction of recovery in the acute phase benefits patients and their families directly, as well as improves the likelihood of detecting efficacy in clinical trials. This issue of heterogeneity is not unique to SCI. In fields such as traumatic brain injury, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, one approach to understand variability in recovery has been to make clinical trial data widely available to the greater research community. We contend that the SCI community should adopt a similar approach in providing open access clinical trial data.",19
"Human granulation intelligence means that people can observe and analyze the same problem from various granulation points of view, which generally acknowledge an essential feature of human intelligence. Each granulation view can generate a granular structure through dividing a cognitive target into some meaningful information granules. This means that a large number of granular structures can be generated from the cognitive target. However, people can group these granular structures and select some representative ones for problem solving. This leads to an interesting research topic: how to efficiently and effectively group a family of granular structures. To address this issue, we first introduce a granular structure distance to measure the difference between two granular structures within a unified knowledge representation. Then, we propose a framework for grouping granular structures, called GGS algorithm, which is used to efficiently partition them. Moreover, two indices denoted as DIS and APD are also designed for evaluating the performance of a grouping result of granular structures. Finally, experiments carried out for nine data sets show that the GGS algorithm comes as a sound solution from perspectives of its convergence, effectiveness and scalability. In this way we have proposed and experimented with the general framework for discovering the structure inherent in granular structures, which can be afterwards used to simulate intelligent behavior of human's abilities of granular structure selection.

"Underutilised crops represent an important component of Southern Africa's agro-biodiversity that has potential to contribute to the region's post-2015 development discourse. We reviewed the potential of underutilised crops with respect to how they can contribute to topical challenges, such as food and nutrition security, human health and well-being, climate change adaptation, the environment, and employment creation in poor rural communities. The fact that underutilised crops are the product of generations of landrace agriculture supports the idea that they are resilient and adapted to the needs of farmers in marginal agricultural environments. In addition, underutilised crops are also seen as offering economic advantages due to their uniqueness, suitability to environments in which they are grown and low input requirements. In certain cases, underutilised crops are associated with specific gender roles with women being seen as particularly significant in their production. Evidence also suggests that the inclusion of underutilised crops in cropping systems contributes to dietary diversity and improved nutrition. In the context of the post-2015 agenda, the potential of underutilised crops to generate income, address food security and their status as a ""subset of biodiversity"" links with a number of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) addressing social, economic and environmental issues.",77
"In multistate survival analysis, the sojourn of a patient through various clinical states is shown to correspond to the diffusion of 1 C of electrical charge through an electrical network. The essential comparison has differentials of probability for the patient to correspond to differentials of charge, and it equates clinical states to electrical nodes. Indeed, if the death state of the patient corresponds to the sink node of the circuit, then the transient current that would be seen on an oscilloscope as the sink output is a plot of the probability density for the survival time of the patient. This electrical circuit analogy is further explored by considering the simplest possible survival model with two clinical states, alive and dead (sink), that incorporates censoring and truncation. The sink output seen on an oscilloscope is a plot of the Kaplan-Meier mass function. Thus, the Kaplan-Meier estimator finds motivation from the dynamics of current flow, as a fundamental physical law, rather than as a nonparametric maximum likelihood estimate (MLE). Generalization to competing risks settings with multiple death states (sinks) leads to cause-specific Kaplan-Meier submass functions as outputs at sink nodes. With covariates present, the electrical analogy provides for an intuitive understanding of partial likelihood and various baseline hazard estimates often used with the proportional hazards model.",50
This paper describes a new method of deriving greater torques per unit volume from Permanent magnet (PM) machine configurations. The method involves splitting of the stator teeth in order to introduce a magnetic gear ratio in to the torque equation. Also some of the theory and mathematical equations behind the design of the new split teeth machine have been shown and descried. Two different initial designs of the new machine topology have been developed using two dimension (2D) finite element (FE) simulations and compared to a convectional brushless DC Machine of the same dimensions. Gains of output torques of all three machines designed were shown for the purpose of comparison.,85
"While previous studies have examined motivational aspects of self-directed violence, few studies have included specific motivations in predictive models for future suicide attempts. The current study utilized a sample of 160 individuals treated in an acute emergency setting following a suicide attempt who completed an interview battery that included an assessment of functional aspects of the index suicide attempt. A follow-up interview was conducted at 6 months to ascertain subsequent suicide attempts. The functional domains of suicide attempts were labeled as reduction-of-distress, communication, perceived better alternative to living, and self-loathing. Above and beyond other known risk factors, including history and highest lethality of previous self-injury, suicide attempts that served a communication function (OR = 0.18, p = .02, CI = 0.04, 0.73) and higher ratings of clinical dysfunction (OR = 3.41, p = .05, CI = 1.02, 11.36) were associated with a significant reduction in likelihood to engage in a suicide attempt during the 6-month follow-up window. Including the perceived effectiveness of the index suicide attempt in getting one's needs met strengthened the overall model predicting a suicide attempt in the follow-up window and was an independent risk factor above and beyond other variables in the model OR = 1.75, p = .04, CI = 1.02, 3.01). Assessment of functional aspects of suicide attempt is feasible and may improve formulation of risk in a population where typical risk factors for suicide are ubiquitous.",70
"IgE-mediated reactions to food allergens are the most common cause of anaphylaxis in childhood. Although allergies to cow's milk, egg, or soy proteins, in contrast to peanut and tree nut allergens, resolve within the first 6 years of life in up to 60% due to natural tolerance development, this process is not well understood. At present, there is no cure or treatment for food allergy that would result in an induction of tolerance to the symptom-eliciting food. Avoidance, providing an emergency plan and education, is the standard of treatment. Oral immunotherapeutic approaches have been proven reasonable efficacy; however, they are associated with high rates of side-effects and low numbers of patients achieving tolerance. Nevertheless, mechanisms that take place during oral immunotherapy may help to understand tolerance development. On the basis of these therapeutic interventions, events like loss of basophil activation and induction of regulatory lymphocyte subsets and of blocking antibodies have been described. Their functional importance at a clinical level, however, remains to be investigated in detail. Consequently, there is eminent need to understand the process of tolerance development to food allergens and define biomarkers to develop and monitor new treatment strategies for food allergy.",105
"Aim: Irisin, the adipomyokine, released mainly by exercised muscles, participate in the browning of adipose tissue and contribute to the restriction of insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus 2 development. Because of the limited reports describing the effect of irisin on inflammation and immunocompetent cells activation, the present study attempted to assess the influence of various irisin concentrations on basic macrophage activity. Main methods: Studies were carried out on murine RAW 264.7 macrophages cultured in medium enriched with irisin (0 nM, 10 nM, 50 nM, or 100 nM). General cell activity, viability, and proliferation were assessed along with phagocytosis process, and respiratory burst generation. Key finding: Irisin level positively correlates with general cell activity and cell cycle progression as well as with phagocytosis intensity, but negatively correlates with the intensity of respiratory burst generation. No influence of irisin on quiescent cell viability, including apoptosis or necrosis, was observed. Significance: This research is the first to show that irisin modulates macrophage activity by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, which could suggest its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, further studies are needed for the evaluation of influence of irisin on immunocompetent cell function. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",120
"Several options for emergency contraception are available in the United States. This article describes each method, including efficacy, mode of action, safety, side effect profile, and availability. The most effective emergency contraceptive is the copper intrauterine device (IUD), followed by ulipristal acetate and levonorgestrel pills. Levonorgestrel is available for sale without restrictions, whereas ulipristal acetate is available with prescription only, and the copper IUD must be inserted by a clinician. Although EC pills have not been shown to reduce pregnancy or abortion rates at the population level, they are an important option for individual women seeking to prevent pregnancy after sex.",124
"Young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience significant rates of unemployment and underemployment, and the field needs an inexpensive, evidence-based vocational intervention. We examined an approach developed for people with serious mental illness, IPS supported employment, for young adults with ASD. We described a pilot IPS program for young adults with ASD and evaluated the first five participants over 1 year. The first five IPS participants succeeded in competitive employment, expanded independence, and achieved broad psychosocial gains. IPS could help young adults with ASD succeed in competitive employment at a relatively low cost.",113
"Resilience is defined as the ability to overcome adverse situations. In sport, the severity of an injury can cause individual and collective problems, but the ability to cope with the injury depends on the ability of resilience. The aim of this study is to analyze the relationships between resilience and sports injuries as a function of the competitive level. For this research, data from 43 athletes practicing football, handball and winter sports (ski and snowboard) were analyzed, using the CD-RISC questionnaire and a checklist of injuries and competitive level. A descriptive and relational analysis was carried out. The results show that athletes who had been injured during the last three seasons and those who had competed at higher levels had a greater capacity for resilience. Given these data, we could conclude that competitive level directly affects the ability to cope with injuries and that athletes who have suffered more injuries, are used to deal with them. However, due to the few differences found, it is clear that resilience depends on individual factors.",27
"Objective: Immune alterations may play a role in bipolar disorder etiology; however, the relationship between overall immune system functioning and mood symptom severity is unknown. Methods: The two comparative effectiveness trials, the Clinical and Health Outcomes Initiatives in Comparative Effectiveness for Bipolar Disorder Study (Bipolar CHOICE) and the Lithium Treatment Moderate-Dose Use Study (LITMUS), were similar trials among patients with bipolar disorder. At study entry, white blood cell count and bipolar mood symptom severity (via Montgomery-Aasberg Depression Rating Scale and Bipolar Inventory of Symptoms Scale) were assessed. We performed analysis of variance and linear regression analyses to investigate relationships between deviations from median white blood cell and multinomial regression analysis between higher and lower white blood cell levels. All analyses were adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, smoking, diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Results: Among 482 Bipolar CHOICE participants, for each 1.0 X 10(9)/L white blood cell deviation, the overall Bipolar Inventory of Symptoms Scale severity increased significantly among men (coefficient=2.13; 95% confidence interval = [0.46, -3.79]; p = 0.013), but not among women (coefficient= 0.87; 95% confidence interval = [-0.87, -2.61]; p = 0.33). Interaction analyses showed a trend toward greater Bipolar Inventory of Symptoms Scale symptom severity among men (coefficient= 1.51; 95% confidence interval=[-0.81, -3.82]; p = 0.2). Among 283 LITMUS participants, higher deviation from the median white blood cell showed a trend toward higher Montgomery-Aasberg Depression Rating Scale scores among men (coefficient= 1.33; 95% confidence interval=[-0.22, -2.89]; p = 0.09), but not among women (coefficient = 0.34; 95% confidence interval = [-0.64, -1.32]; p = 0.50). When combining LiTMUS and Bipolar CHOICE, Montgomery-Aasberg Depression Rating Scale scores increased significantly among men (coefficient= 1.09; 95% confidence interval = [0.31, -1.87]; p = 0.006) for each 1.0 X 10(9)/L. white blood cell deviation, whereas we found a weak association among women (coefficient= 0.55; 95% confidence interval = [-0.20, -1.29]; p = 0.14). Lower and higher white blood cell levels correlated with greater symptom severity and specific symptoms, varying according to gender. Conclusion: Deviations in an overall immune system marker, even within the normal white blood cell range, correlated with mood symptom severity in bipolar disorder, mostly among males. Studies are warranted investigating whether white blood cell count may predict response to mood-stabilizing treatment.",72
"Cancer cells are the site of numerous metabolic and thermodynamic abnormalities. We focus this review on the interactions between the canonical WNT/beta-catenin pathway and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) in cancers and their implications from an energetic and metabolic point of view. In numerous tissues, PPAR gamma activation induces inhibition of beta-catenin pathway, while the activation of the canonical WNT/ beta-catenin pathway inactivates PPAR gamma. In most cancers but not all, PPAR gamma is downregulated while the WNT/beta-catenin pathway is upregulated. In cancer cells, upregulation of the WNT/beta-catenin signaling induces dramatic changes in key metabolic enzymes that modify their thermodynamic behavior. This leads to activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase1 (PDK-1) and monocarboxylate lactate transporter. Consequently, phosphorylation of PDK-1 inhibits the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH). Thus, a large part of pyruvate cannot be converted into acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) in mitochondria and only a part of acetyl-CoA can enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This leads to aerobic glycolysis in spite of the availability of oxygen. This phenomenon is referred to as the Warburg effect. Cytoplasmic pyruvate is converted into lactate. The WNT/beta-catenin pathway induces the transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation, i.e., MYC and CYCLIN D1. This ultimately promotes the nucleotide, protein and lipid synthesis necessary for cell growth and multiplication. In cancer, activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway induces an increase of the aerobic glycolysis. Moreover, prostaglandin E2 by activating the canonical WNT pathway plays also a role in cancer. In addition in many cancer cells, PPAR gamma is downregulated. Moreover, PPAR gamma contributes to regulate some key circadian genes. In cancers, abnormalities in the regulation of circadian rhythms (CRs) are observed. CRs are dissipative structures which play a key-role in far-from-equilibrium thermodynamics. In cancers, metabolism, thermodynamics and CRs are intimately interrelated.",88
"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Altered blood BDNF levels have been frequently identified in people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). There are however wide discrepancies in the evidence. Therefore, we performed the present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at qualitative and quantitative synthesis of studies that measured blood BDNF levels in ASD and control subjects. Observational studies were identified through electronic database searching and also hand-searching of reference lists of relevant articles. A total of 183 papers were initially identified for review and eventually twenty studies were included in the meta-analysis. A meta-analysis of blood BDNF in 887 patients with ASD and 901 control subjects demonstrated significantly higher BDNF levels in ASD compared to controls with the SMD of 0.47 (95% CI 0.07-0.86, p = 0.02). In addition subgroup meta-analyses were performed based on the BDNF specimen. The present meta-analysis study led to conclusion that BDNF might play role in autism initiation/ propagation and therefore it can be considered as a possible biomarker of ASD.",113
"The purposes of this study were to: (1) Assess child abuse professionals' and nonprofessionals' knowledge of scientific research findings that are relevant to forensic child sexual abuse (CSA) evaluations and (2) describe associations between child abuse professionals' levels of research knowledge and their education and experience. An 18-item multiple-choice test was administered to 188 child abuse professionals and 457 nonprofessionals (undergraduate college students) in Brazil and the United States. The nonprofessionals' average percent correct, M=44%, was not significantly different than what would be expected for random guessing (45%). The professionals' average percent correct, M=55%, was higher than that of nonprofessionals and random guessing (both ps<.001). The average percent correct score for the US-sample psychologists, M= 76%, was higher than the average score of the other professionals, M= 51%, p<.001. Professionals' educational level, as measured by the highest academic degree obtained, was positively associated with percent correct scores, Spearman's rho=.46, p<.001. Controlling for educational attainment, professional experience, as measured by the total number of CSA evaluations performed, was weakly associated with percent correct scores, partial r=.15, p=.04. Percent correct scores were low for both nonprofessionals and professionals. Most of the participants in this study were uninformed or misinformed about scientific research findings that are important for conducting optimal forensic CSA evaluations and for making accurate judgments about the validity of sexual abuse allegations.

"Saccharomyces cerevisiae is frequently used as a bioreactor for conversion of exogenously acquired metabolites into value-added products, but has not been utilized for bioconversion of low-cost lipids such as triacylglycerols (TAGs) because the cells are typically unable to acquire these lipid substrates from the growth media. To help circumvent this limitation, the Yarrowia lipolytica lipase 2 (LIP2) gene was cloned into S. cerevisiae expression vectors and used to generate S. cerevisiae strains that secrete active Lip2 lipase (Lip2p) enzyme into the growth media. Specifically, LIP2 expression was driven by the S. cerevisiae PEX11 promoter, which maintains basal transgene expression levels in the presence of sugars in the culture medium but is rapidly upregulated by fatty acids. Northern blotting, lipase enzyme activity assays, and gas chromatographic measurements of cellular fatty acid composition after lipid feeding all confirmed that cells transformed with the PEX11 promoter-LIP2 construct were responsive to lipids in the media, i.e., cells expressing LIP2 responded rapidly to either free fatty acids or TAGs and accumulated high levels of the corresponding fatty acids in intracellular lipids. These data provided evidence of the creation of a self-regulating positive control feedback loop that allows the cells to upregulate Lip2p production only when lipids are present in the media. Regulated, autonomous production of extracellular lipase activity is a necessary step towards the generation of yeast strains that can serve as biocatalysts for conversion of low-value lipids to value-added TAGs and other novel lipid products.",38
"In this study, real-time estimation of flow rate and pressure along natural gas pipelines under transient flow condition is aimed. The estimation of the internal states of gas pipelines is based on a recursive discrete data filtering algorithm called the discrete Kalman filter. The state space representation of the transient flow in gas pipelines, which is required for the filtering algorithm, is established by a discrete form of the nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE's) describing the characteristics of transient gas flow. The PDE's are discretized by the finite element method and an implicit scheme is employed in order to obtain a simple and adequate algebraic set of equations for the transient gas flow. The state estimator uses these linearized equations and the estimation phase is performed using simulated data imitating measurements. The motivation of this work is to estimate the actual state of the flow with the online data by applying the discrete state-space model of the flow. Therefore, the estimator is developed for a situation where pressure measurements at a few points along the pipe and one flow rate data at the outlet end of the pipe are available. Moreover, to improve the performance of the estimator, the state estimation with a pair of Kalman filter based estimators running in parallel is also proposed. The performance of state estimations is tested on a case study from the literature. The developed estimator can predict the simulated states even with incomplete and/or faulty information on the system parameters. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",58
"Changes in understanding regarding the relationship of androgens and prostate cancer have led to changes in the use of testosterone therapy. The evidence supports a finite ability of androgens to stimulate prostate cancer growth, with a maximum achieved at low testosterone concentrations, called the saturation model. The saturation point corresponds with maximal androgenic stimulation at 250 ng/dL. Evidence is reviewed herein regarding the relationship of testosterone to prostate cancer and the relatively new practice of offering testosterone therapy to men with a history of prostate cancer. Although no prospective controlled trials have been performed, results have been reassuring.",6
"Expertise tends to be seen as something people possess: one needs to have the knowledge, skills and competences to be able to do a job well, preferably better than others, under various conditions. In practice not all objectively relevant knowledge and expertise gets endorsed as such. In multi-party settings different forms of expertise tend to compete with one another. The latter is certainly true for the construction sector in which parties with different backgrounds, stakes and interests work together in order to create or maintain buildings and infrastructural works. Existing knowledge and expertise need to be performed in order to get treated as relevant to the interactional business at hand by the people one collaborates with. Whose expertise is treated as most salient may differ across interaction settings that make up the different phases of a project. So far, however, what expertise is treated as relevant when in the day-to-day management of construction projects and the effects thereof have been understudied. The argument put forward is that expertise research informed by the performative turn in the social sciences may enrich the construction management research agenda. Performative studies tend to further insight in what expertise ends up to being treated as relevant when in actual practice, e.g. by researching how various expertises are discursively positioned relative to one another in multi-party settings. Insight into how and when existing expertise counts may be of help in developing strategies to ensure that expertise that is considered relevant but is underused in practice may be optimally deployed in the future. General directions are provided for how expertise may be researched from a performative perspective in construction.",102
"Urban parks are easily available settings for seniors to engage in daily physical activity. As a type of low-cost physical activity, walking can bring seniors multiple health benefits. Among all park facilities, park pathways are most significantly related to physical activity. The present study examined the links between specific park pathway design characteristics and senior walking within urban park, through observations and interviews. This study was conducted in two neighborhood parks in Beijing, China. On-site observations were utilized to collect data on senior walking behavior (dependent variable) and pathway design characteristics (independent variable). We calculated the average number of observed seniors in all observations to represent usage of each pathway segment. Interviews were conducted to explore pathway design characteristics preferred and disliked by senior users. ANOVA analyses and correlation analyses revealed that seniors prefer pathways that have soft or even pavement (plastic track and bricks), benches, flowers, and light fixtures. Also, seniors are attracted to pathways that are long, between 3-3.9 meters wide, and without connection with activity zones. In addition, results suggest other pathway design characteristics, such as being along a water body, having shade, providing lateral visibility and visual connection with water, and without visual connection with landmarks may also encourage senior walking. By providing park pathways preferred by seniors, designers can create park environments that are supportive of senior walking, and ultimately contribute to improving senior health and life quality.

"Hip fractures in elderly patients are the most severe form of fragility fractures. They can lead to significant morbidity and mortality; additionally, they have an enormous economic and social burden. Treatment of hip fractures in elderly patients should be based on a prompt initial evaluation, followed by surgical treatment without unnecessary delays under a collaborative effort of a multidisciplinary team. Postoperative care should be started immediately after surgery, and it must include an intensive rehabilitation, as well as treatment of osteoporosis and any other metabolic imbalance. This review incorporates current literature on initial evaluation and definitive management of hip fractures in the elderly and is intended to assist practitioners of different specialties treating these patients.",16
"People can accurately assess various personality traits of others based on body odor (BO) alone. Previous studies have shown that correlations between odor ratings and self-assessed personality dimensions are evident for assessments of neuroticism and dominance. Here, we tested differences between assessments based on natural body odor alone, without the use of cosmetics and assessments based on the body odor of people who were allowed to use cosmetics following their daily routine. Sixty-seven observers assessed samples of odors from 113 odor donors (each odor donor provided two samples one with and one without cosmetic use); the donors provided their personality ratings, and the raters judged personality characteristics of the donors based on the provided odor samples. Correlations between observers' ratings and self-rated neuroticism were stronger when raters assessed body odor in the natural body odor condition (natural BO condition; r(s) = 0.20) than in the cosmetics use condition (BO+cosmetics condition; r(s) = 0.15). Ratings of dominance significantly predicted self-assessed dominance in both conditions (r(s) = 0.34 for natural BO and r(s) = 0.21 for BO+cosmetics), whereas ratings of extraversion did not predict self-assessed extraversion in either condition. In addition, ratings of body odor attractiveness and pleasantness were significantly lower in natural BO condition than in BO+cosmetics condition, although the intensity of donors' body odors was similar under both conditions. Our findings suggest that although olfaction seems to contribute to accurate first impression judgments of certain personality traits, cosmetic use can affect assessments of others based on body odor.",64
"Background: Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail plate and subungual area. In this study, we examined the efficacy of laser treatment using self-controlled study programs involving a long-pulsed Nd:YAG 1064-nm laser combined with oral medication. Methods: Self-controlled strategies were followed in this study. The patients received treatment with oral itraconazole in conjunction with long-pulsed Nd: YAG 1064-nm laser treatment at the nails of the unilateral limb once a week for a total of four times. A total of 84 affected nails were divided into Group A (mild to moderate) and Group B (severe) according to disease severity. Affected nails with the same Scoring Clinical Index for Onychomycosis scores were selected to compare the therapeutic effects of the pure medication treatment group and the combination treatment group with a 24-week follow-up period. Results: In Group A, at the 8th, 16th, and 24th weeks of follow-up, the efficacies in the pure medication treatment group were 81.0%, 81.0%, and 90.5%, respectively, while those in the combination treatment group were 100%, 95.2%, and 90.5%, respectively. The differences between groups were not significant (8th week: chi(2) = 4.421, P >0.05; 16th week: chi(2) = 2.043, P >0.05; 24th week: chi(2) = 0.00, P >0.05). In Group B, at the 8th, 16th, and 24th weeks of follow-up, the efficacies in the pure medication treatment group were 61.9%, 66.7%, and 52.4%, respectively, while those in the combination treatment group were 95.2%, 90.5%, and 100%, respectively. The differences between groups at the 8th and 24th weeks of follow-up were statistically significant (8th week: chi(2) = 6.929, P < 0.05; 24th week: chi(2) = 13.125, P < 0.05). Conclusions: For patients with mild or moderate onychomycosis, we recommended a pure medication treatment or combination treatment with medication and laser. For those patients with severe onychomycosis, we recommended a combination of medication and laser therapy.",126
"Soil-reinforcement interaction mechanism is an important issue in the design of geosynthetic reinforced soil structures. This mechanism depends on the soil properties, reinforcement characteristics and interaction between these two elements (soil and reinforcement). In this work the shear strength of sand/geotextile interfaces were characterized through direct and simple shear tests. The direct shear tests were performed on a conventional direct shear device and on a large scale direct shear apparatus. Unreinforced sand and one layer reinforced sand specimens were characterized trough simple shear tests. The interfaces shear strength achieved with the large scale direct shear device were slightly larger than those obtained with the conventional direct shear apparatus. Notwithstanding the differences between the shear strength characterization through simple shear and direct shear tests, it was concluded that the shear strength of one layer reinforced sand is similar to the sand/geotextile interface direct shear strength.",93
"An Omega-3 chicken egg is a chicken egg produced through food engineering technology. It is produced by hen fed with high omega-3 fatty acids. So, it has fifteen times nutrient content of omega-3 higher than Leghorn's. Visually, its shell has the same shape and colour as Leghorn's. Each egg can be distinguished by breaking the egg's shell and testing the egg yolk's nutrient content in a laboratory. But, those methods were proven not effective and efficient. Observing this problem, the purpose of this research is to make an application to detect the type of omega-3 chicken egg by using a mobile-based computer vision. This application was built in OpenCV computer vision library to support Android Operating System. This experiment required some chicken egg images taken using an egg candling box. We used 60 omega-3 chicken and Leghorn eggs as samples. Then, using an Android smartphone, image acquisition of the egg was obtained. After that, we applied several steps using image processing methods such as Grab Cut, convert RGB image to eight bit grayscale, median filter, P-Tile segmentation, and morphology technique in this research. The next steps were feature extraction which was used to extract feature values via mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis from each image. Finally, using digital image measurement, some chicken egg images were classified. The result showed that omega-3 chicken egg and Leghorn egg had different values. This system is able to provide accurate reading around of 91%.",0
"Objective: Zeneo(1) is a needle-free injection device. We performed a pharmacokinetic study to investigate the bioequivalence of methotrexate administered subcutaneously using either the needle-free injection device or a conventional needle and syringe. Research design and methods: This was a single-dose, open-label, laboratory-blind, randomized crossover study performed in adult healthy volunteers. Each participant received two methotrexate injections (each 25mg), one via needle-free injection device and one via conventional injection, with a 21-28day wash-out interval between dosing. For each participant, the administration site for both injections was either the abdomen or the thigh. Main outcome measures: The primary pharmacokinetic outcome parameters were AUC((0-t)) and C-max. Bioequivalence was assessed by standard criteria: whether 90% confidence intervals of geometric mean ratios for the two administration methods were within 80-125%. Results: Fifty-two individuals completed the study. Bioequivalence criteria were met for AUC((0-t)), for the overall analysis (both injection sites: 90% confidence interval: 99.4-103.1%), and for each injection site separately. Bioequivalence was similarly demonstrated with AUC((0-)). Bioequivalence criteria for C-max were fulfilled for abdominal administration but not for the overall analysis. Injection via the needle-free injection device was well tolerated.Limitations: Limitations include conducting the study in healthy volunteers and the relatively small subject number (albeit satisfactory for bioequivalence). Conclusions: This study shows that methotrexate injection via needle-free injection device is bioequivalent to a conventional needle and syringe in relation to AUC((0-t)) and AUC((0-)). Studies of needle-free injection device use in patients requiring methotrexate therapy are planned.",21
"The aim of this study was to determine the polyphenols, glucosinolates and ascorbic acid content as well as antioxidant activity of beverages on the base of apple juice with addition of frozen and freeze-dried curly kale leaves. Upon enrichment with frozen (13%) and freeze-dried curly kale (3%), the naturally cloudy apple juice was characterized by an increase in phenolic compounds by 2.7 and 3.3-times, accordingly. The antioxidant activity of beverages with the addition of curly kale ranged from 6.6 to 9.4 p.mol Trolox/mL. The obtained beverages were characterized glucosinolates content at 117.6-167.6 mg/L and ascorbic acid content at 4,1-31,9 mg/L. The results of sensory evaluation of colour, taste and consistency of apple juice and beverages with the addition of kale did not differ significantly prior to pasteurization (P <= 0.05), whereas after the pasteurization the evaluated factors decreased significantly.

"Limiting the post-weaning intake of the young rabbit is known to improve its resistance to digestive disorders, whereas a degradation of its housing hygiene is assumed to have a negative impact on its health. This study aims at providing insights into the mechanism of digestive health preservation regarding both host (growth and immune response) and its symbiotic digestive microbiota. A 2x2 factorial design from weaning (day 28) to day 64 was set up: ad libitum intake or restricted intake at 70% of ad libitum, and high v. low hygiene of housing (n=105 per group). At day 36 and day 45, 15 animals/group were subcutaneously immunized with ovalbumin (OVA) to assess their specific immune response. Blood was sampled at 36, 45, 57 and 64 days of age to determine total and anti-OVA immunoglobulin type G (IgG) and haptoglobin levels. The cecal bacterial community was explored (18 per group) by 454 pyrosequencing of genes coding for the 16S ribosomal RNA, whereas cecal pH, NH3 and volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations were measured to characterize fermentative activity. A 30% reduction in feed intake reduced the growth by only 17% (P<0.001), and improved the feed conversion ratio by 15% (P<0.001), whereas the degradation of hygiene conditions slightly decreased the feed intake in ad libitum fed rabbits (-3.5%, P<0.02). As poor hygiene conditions did not affect weight gain, feed conversion was improved from day 42 (P<0.05). Restricted feeding led to a lower mortality between day 28 and day 40 (P=0.047), whereas degraded hygiene conditions decreased overall morbidity (7.8% v. 16.6%; P<0.01). Both a reduced intake and low hygiene conditions of housing affected microbiota composition and especially dominant genera belonging to the Ruminococcaceae family (P<0.01). Moreover, low hygiene was associated with a higher Ruminococcaceae/Lachnospiraceae ratio (3.7 v. 2.4; P<0.05). Cecal total VFA and pH were increased (+19%; P<0.001) and decreased (-0.1 pH unit; P<0.05), respectively, in feed-restricted rabbits. Neither specific anti-OVA IgG nor haptoglobin was affected by treatments. Total IgG concentrations were the highest in animals raised in poor hygiene conditions after 8 days of restriction, but decreased after 19 days of restriction in high hygiene conditions (-2.15%; P<0.05). In conclusion, the degradation of hygiene conditions failed to induce a systematic specific and inflammatory response in rabbit, but reduced morbidity instead. Our results suggest that the microbiota composition would be a helpful source of biomarkers of digestive health.",122
"This study analyzes muscle activity, recorded in an eight-channel electromyographic (EMG) signal stream, during the golf swing using a 7-iron club and exploits information extracted from EMG dynamics to predict the success of the resulting shot. Muscles of the arm and shoulder on both the left and right sides, namely flexor carpi radialis, extensor digitorum communis, rhomboideus and trapezius, are considered for 15 golf players (similar to 5 shots each). The method using Gaussian filtering is outlined for EMG onset time estimation in each channel and activation sequence profiling. Shots of each player revealed a persistent pattern of muscle activation. Profiles were plotted and insights with respect to player effectiveness were provided. Inspection of EMG dynamics revealed a pair of highest peaks in each channel as the hallmark of golf swing, and a custom application of peak detection for automatic extraction of swing segment was introduced. Various EMG features, encompassing 22 feature sets, were constructed. Feature sets were used individually and also in decision-level fusion for the prediction of shot effectiveness. The prediction of the target attribute, such as club head speed or ball carry distance, was investigated using random forest as the learner in detection and regression tasks. Detection evaluates the personal effectiveness of a shot with respect to the player-specific average, whereas regression estimates the value of target attribute, using EMG features as predictors. Fusion after decision optimization provided the best results: the equal error rate in detection was 24.3% for the speed and 31.7% for the distance; the mean absolute percentage error in regression was 3.2% for the speed and 6.4% for the distance. Proposed EMG feature sets were found to be useful, especially when used in combination. Rankings of feature sets indicated statistics for muscle activity in both the left and right body sides, correlation-based analysis of EMG dynamics and features derived from the properties of two highest peaks as important predictors of personal shot effectiveness. Activation sequence profiles helped in analyzing muscle orchestration during golf shot, exposing a specific avalanche pattern, but data from more players are needed for stronger conclusions. Results demonstrate that information arising from an EMG signal stream is useful for predicting golf shot success, in terms of club head speed and ball carry distance, with acceptable accuracy. Surface EMG data, collected with a goal to automatically evaluate golf player's performance, enables wearable computing in the field of ambient intelligence and has potential to enhance exercising of a long carry distance drive.",92
"Communication may be verbal and nonverbal. Communication changes are commonly reported in older people. In the typical process of aging, communication skills change due to health issues such as depression and cognitive problems. In this review manuscript, communication problems in elderly people are presented. There are health problems found in individuals of older age groups that may affect communication. Examples of these are as follows: cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, hearing and visual loss, aphasia, and neurodegenerative diseases. To improve communication with older adults, some measures should be followed, such as ""Speak at a normal conversational pace. Avoid speaking very quickly or very slowly"" and ""Repeat and elaborate on important points."" Communication disorders are experienced in older adults. Etiologic factors may be related to general health problems such as neurological problems, hearing and visual loss, and social problems (such as retirement or social isolation). In older adults with communication disorders, everyone throughout society, and especially health care specialists, should be aware of the problem and should use the simple measures to improve communication problems. In this paper, the issue of communication problems in elderly people will be evaluated.",64
"This letter presents a gait classification technique for the identification of individuals with different gait patterns using simulated micro-Doppler radar remote sensing data. Proposed feature parameters for the classification are principal components of velocities extracted via micro-Doppler radar signals generated using motion capture-based kinematic data. Distinct differences were found in the proposed parameters among three groups of subjects with different gait patterns: healthy young and elderly adults, and elderly adults with a history of falls (elderly fallers).",94
"Confabulations offer unique opportunities for establishing the neurobiological basis of delusional thinking. As regards causal factors, a review of the confabulation literature suggests that neither amnesia nor executive impairment can be the sole (or perhaps even the primary) cause of all delusional beliefs though they may act in concert with other factors. A key perspective in the modern literature is that many delusions have an emotionally positive or 'wishful' element, that may serve to modulate or manage emotional experience. Some authors have referred to this perspective as the 'emotion dysregulation' hypothesis. In this article we review the theoretical underpinnings of this approach, and develop the idea by suggesting that the positive aspects of confabulatory states may have a role in perpetuating the imbalance between cognitive control and emotion. We draw on existing evidence from fields outside neuropsychology, to argue for three main causal factors: that positive emotions are related to more global or schematic forms of cognitive processing; that positive emotions influence the accuracy of memory recollection; and that positive emotions make people more susceptible to false memories. These findings suggest that the emotions that we want to feel (or do not want to feel) can influence the way we reconstruct past experiences and generate a sense of self a proposition that bears on a unified theory of delusional belief states.

"First-known exact solutions are derived for free vibration of thick and moderately thick functionally graded rectangular plates with at least one pair of opposite edges simply-supported on the basis of a family of two-dimensional shear and normal deformation theories with variable order. The boundary-value problem is first expressed in a compact unified form which is invariant with respect to the order of the kinematic theory. The Levy method applied to this compact form yields a set of governing equations written in terms of invariant matrices, which are then appropriately expanded according to the order of the plate model. The resulting equations are put into a state-space representation and the frequency values are finally obtained by substituting the general solution of the state equation into the set of boundary conditions and solving the related homogeneous system. After discussing the way of recovering the through-the-thickness modal displacement and stress distribution at any point of the plate and how the effective elastic properties of the graded plate are computed, some numerical results are presented using various higher-order theories. Comparisons with exact three-dimensional and other two-dimensional approaches are provided for two-constituents metal-ceramic plates. New exact results for functionally graded plates with six combinations of boundary conditions are also obtained. They can be useful as valuable sources for validating other approaches and approximate methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",58
"Individual-level characteristics, including socioeconomic status, have been associated with poor metabolic and cardiovascular health; however, residential area-level characteristics may also independently contribute to health status. In the current study, we used hierarchical clustering to aggregate 444 US Census block groups in Durham, Orange, and Wake Counties, NC, USA into six homogeneous clusters of similar characteristics based on 12 demographic factors. We assigned 2254 cardiac catheterization patients to these clusters based on residence at first catheterization. After controlling for individual age, sex, smoking status, and race, there were elevated odds of patients being obese (odds ratio (OR) = 1.92, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 1.39, 2.67), and having diabetes (OR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.57, 3.04), congestive heart failure (OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.39, 2.83), and hypertension (OR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.38, 3.11) in a cluster that was urban, impoverished, and unemployed, compared with a cluster that was urban with a low percentage of people that were impoverished or unemployed. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of applying hierarchical clustering to an assessment of area-level characteristics and that living in impoverished, urban residential clusters may have an adverse impact on health.",129
"The present paper deals with the problem of characterization of oscillating magnetic dipole (OMD) signals and the development of a suitable magnetic anomaly detection (MAD) algorithm for it. The resulting outcomes of investigating the above mentioned problem are: (1) a development of a complete model of the noise and the signal based on a non-linear gravity pendulum model. This model was compared and verified against real world magnetic signals, as well as simulated ones. (2) A detection algorithm that utilizes this model by whitening the noise and seeking for periodical features in the signal. The developed algorithm has high noise immunity with high detection probabilities even at as low SNR as -10 dB. Compared to benchmark detectors, our detection scheme offers performance improved by 5-10 dB. Moreover, when testing the detector against real world signals, the SNR difference in respect to the performance predicted by the simulations was less than 2.5 dB.",94
"Internal combustion engines were the technology of choice for propulsion and decentral power supply in the last century. Due to the high energy density of hydrocarbon based fuels that could so far not be reached by alternative technologies they will keep their leading role in most applications for the next decades. Although, its general functionality seems to be unchanged since its invention, the internal combustion engine has gone through substantial developments driven by various challenges. Within these, the pollution control has to be named first due to its role as the main driver for engine and aftertreatment development since the discussions on air quality which started 70 years ago. Meanwhile, all industrialized countries and most of the emerging countries have more or less stringent regulations for the main harmful exhaust components (HC, CO, NOX, Particulates). The second main challenge to be named is the reduction of CO2 emissions. Various engine technologies that are currently used to tackle these global trends lead to major impact on the exhaust aftertreatment components. To tackle these challenges the exhaust aftertreatment development has to be understood as integrated, multi-disciplinary and multi-scale design process considering engine design and operation, on board diagnosis and aftertreatment design and operation likewise.",87
"In this paper we present an analysis of the voltage amplifier needed for double differential (DD) sEMG measurements and a novel, very simple circuit for implementing DD active electrodes. The three-input amplifier that standalone DD active electrodes require is inherently different from a differential amplifier, and general knowledge about its design is scarce in the literature. First, the figures of merit of the amplifier are defined through a decomposition of its input signal into three orthogonal modes. This analysis reveals a mode containing EMG crosstalk components that the DD electrode should reject. Then, the effect of finite input impedance is analyzed. Because there are three terminals, minimum bounds for interference rejection ratios due to electrode and input impedance unbalances with two degrees of freedom are obtained. Finally, a novel circuit design is presented, including only a quadruple operational amplifier and a few passive components. This design is nearly as simple as the branched electrode and much simpler than the three instrumentation amplifier design, while providing robust EMG crosstalk rejection and better input impedance using unity gain buffers for each electrode input. The interference rejection limits of this input stage are analyzed. An easily replicable implementation of the proposed circuit is described, together with a parameter design guideline to adjust it to specific needs. The electrode is compared with the established alternatives, and sample sEMG signals are obtained, acquired on different body locations with dry contacts, successfully rejecting interference sources.",60
"Background. Multi-Scale Ranked Organizing Map coupled with Implicit Function as Squashing Time algorithm(MS-ROM/I-FAST) is a new, complex system based on Artificial Neural networks (ANNs) able to extract features of interest in computerized EEG through the analysis of few minutes of their EEC without any preliminary pre-processing. A proof of concept study previously published showed accuracy values ranging from 94%-98% in discerning subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment and/or Alzheimer's Disease from healthy elderly people. The presence of deviant patterns in simple resting state EEG recordings in autism, consistent with the atypical organization of the cerebral cortex present, prompted us in applying this potent analytical systems in search of a EEG signature of the disease. Aim of the study. The aim of the study is to assess how effectively this methodology distinguishes subjects with autism from typically developing ones. Methods. Fifteen definite ASD subjects (13 males; 2 females; age range 7-14; mean value = 10.4) and ten typically developing subjects (4 males; 6 females; age range 7-12; mean value 9.2) were included in the study. Patients received Autism diagnoses according to DSM-V criteria, subsequently confirmed by the ADOS scale. A segment of artefact-free EEG lasting 60 seconds was used to compute input values for subsequent analyses. MS-ROM/I-FAST coupled with a well-documented evolutionary system able to select predictive features (TWIST) created an invariant features vector input of EEC on which supervised machine learning systems acted as blind classifiers. Results. The overall predictive capability of machine learning system in sorting out autistic cases from normal control amounted consistently to 100% with all kind of systems employed using training-testing protocol and to 84% - 92.8% using Leave One Out protocol. The similarities among the ANN weight matrixes measured with apposite algorithms were not affected by the age of the subjects. This suggests that the ANNs do not read age-related EEG patterns, but rather invariant features related to the brain's underlying disconnection signature. Conclusion. This pilot study seems to open up new avenues for the development of non-invasive diagnostic testing for the early detection of ASD. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1
"Demonstrating non-inferiority in clinical trials is usually more challenging than showing superiority. In multiple sclerosis (MS), non-inferiority trials are rarely designed since they would require prohibitive sample sizes.

"We propose a three-state frailty Markov model coupled with likelihood-based inference to analyse tooth level life course data in caries research. This analysis is challenging because of intraoral clustering, interval censoring, multiplicity of caries states and computational complexities. We also develop a Bayesian approach to predict future caries transition probabilities given observed life history data. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the methods proposed perform very well in finite samples with moderate sizes. The practical utility of the model is illustrated by using life course data from a unique longitudinal study of dental caries in young low income urban African-American children. In this analysis, we evaluate for any spatial symmetry in the mouth with respect to the life course of dental caries, and whether the same type of tooth has a similar decay process in boys and girls.",22
"AIM To compare the impact of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) on weight loss and obesity related comorbidities over two year follow-up via case control study design. METHODS Forty patients undergoing LRYGB, who completed their two year follow-up were matched with 40 patients undergoing LSG for age, gender, body mass index and presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Data of these patients was retrospectively reviewed to compare the outcome in terms of weight loss and improvement in comorbidities, i.e., T2DM, hypertension (HTN), obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), hypothyroidism and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). RESULTS Percentage excess weight loss (EWL%) was similar in LRYGB and LSG groups at one year follow-up (70.5% vs 66.5%, P = 0.36) while it was significantly greater for LRYGB group after two years as compared to LSG group (76.5% vs 67.9%, P = 0.04). The complication rate after LRYGB and LSG was similar (10% vs 7.5%, p = 0.99). The median duration of T2DM and mean number of oral hypoglycemic agents were higher in LRYGB group than LSG group (7 years vs 5 years and 2.2 vs 1.8 respectively, P < 0.05). Both LRYGB and LSG had significant but similar improvement in T2DM, HTN, OSAS and hypothyroidism. However, GERD resolved in all patients undergoing LRYGB while it resolved in only 50% cases with LSG. Eight point three percent patients developed new-onset GERD after LSG. CONCLUSION LRYGB has better outcomes in terms of weight loss two years after surgery as compared to LSG. The impact of LRYGB and LSG on T2DM, HTN, OSAS and hypothyroidism is similar. However, LRYGB has significant resolution of GERD as compared to LSG.",121
"Our keynote article Coactivation in bilingual grammars: A computational account of code mixing (Goldrick, Putnam & Schwarz) aimed to provide a framework that would begin to unify psycholinguistic and formal grammatical approaches to code mixing. We situated our account within a large body of psycholinguistic and phonetic evidence suggesting that, under many conditions, multiple representational elements simultaneously occupy (to varying degrees) a single position within a linguistic structure. The presence of such blends in multilingual cognition is not compatible with many formal grammatical approaches that assume mental representations are necessarily discrete.",24
"The dielectric behavior of polyacrylonitrile derived carbon nanofibers formed at different carbonization temperatures was investigated using impedance spectroscopy. The impedance data are presented in the form of Cole-Cole plots and four equivalent electrical circuits are derived. It is found that by increasing carbonization temperature from 500 to 800 degrees C, a strong capacitive element in the parallel equivalent circuit is transformed into an inductive element, while the contact resistance and parallel resistance are significantly decreased. Along with the morphological and chemical structural evolution, respectively witnessed by scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy, the dielectric transition deduced from the transformation of electrical circuits can be correlated to the proposed microstructural changes of polyacrylonitrile derived carbon nanofibers and the interaction/interference among them.",45
"Malocclusion caused by abnormal jaw development or muscle overuse during mastication results in abnormal mechanical stress to the tissues surrounding the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Excessive mechanical stress against soft and hard tissues around the TMJ is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, including osteoarthritis (OA). OA-related fibrosis is a possible cause of joint stiffness in OA. However, cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying fibrosis around the TMJ remain to be clarified. Here, we established a cell line of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) derived from the mouse TMJ. Then, we examined whether the Rho-associated coiled-coil forming kinase (ROCK)/actin/myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF) gene regulatory axis positively regulates the myofibroblast (MF) differentiation status of FLSs. We found that i) FLSs extensively expressed the MF markers -smooth muscle actin (-SMA) and type I collagen; and ii) an inhibitor against the actin-polymerizing agent ROCK, Y-27632; iii) an actin-depolymerizing agent cytochalasin B; iv) an inhibitor of the MRTF/serum response factor-regulated transcription, CCG-100602, clearly suppressed the mRNA levels of -SMA and type I collagen in FLSs; and v) an MF differentiation attenuator fibroblast growth factor-1 suppressed filamentous actin formation and clearly suppressed the mRNA levels of -SMA and type I collagen in FLSs. These results strongly suggest that the ROCK/actin/MRTF axis promotes the fibrogenic activity of synoviocytes around the TMJ. Our findings partially clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the emergence of TMJ-OA and may aid in identifying drug targets for treating this condition at the molecular level.",15
"High-level exposures to a number of agents are known to have direct nephrotoxic effects in children. A growing body of literature supports the hypothesis that chronic, relatively low-level exposure to various nephrotoxicants may also increase the risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) or accelerate its progression. In this review we highlight several environmental nephrotoxicants and their association with CKD in children and adolescents. We also discuss unique epidemiological challenges in the use of kidney biomarkers in environmental nephrotoxicology.",5
"Vagal intramuscular arrays (IMAs) have been shown to form complexes with intramuscular interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC). We tested the hypothesis that associations between vagal nerve endings and ICC arise in fetal development. Intraganglionic laminar endings (IGLEs) and IMAs were identified by applying 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3,3-tetramethylindocarbocyanineperchlorate (DiI) to vagal nerve trunks and myenteric plexus (MP) and intramuscular (IM) ICC were immunolabeled with antibodies to c-Kit in fetal and early postnatal mice (E16-P7). At E16, c-Kit immunoreactive cells were abundant in the primordial smooth muscle, with early ICC networks discernable by E18 and ongoing organization at P1 and P7. The distribution of vagal endings was found to change during the course of development, with significantly more putative IGLEs in the prenatal compared to the postnatal period and less IMAs in the prenatal compared to postnatal period. Associations of ICC with both IGLEs and IMAs were detected as early as E16 and were maintained into postnatal life. These findings suggest that vagal fibers begin to associate with ICC during prenatal development. Future studies will be needed to determine the mechanisms through which vagal endings and ICC interact. Anat Rec, 298:1780-1785, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",75
"A complex construction program usually consists of a group of interrelated projects with different levels of importance and degrees of certainty. Currently, time management of a construction program uses the same techniques as those for a single project, and the most commonly used technique is the critical path method (CPM). However, the CPM method lacks flexibility in handling uncertainties and options, a desirable feature in managing complex programs. This paper proposes a new scheduling method that is drawn from the authors' experiences of managing a large-scale construction program-the Shanghai Expo facility construction. The new method is developed on the basis of the traditional CPM method but is able to incorporate options and importance levels into the program schedule. The theoretical basis and calculation method of this new scheduling technique are discussed in the context of managing the Shanghai Expo facility construction program. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge in construction management by developing a new scheduling technique with proven applications. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",102
"The Langlands Programme, formulated by Robert Langlands in the 1960s and since much developed and refined, is a web of interrelated theory and conjectures concerning many objects in number theory, their interconnections, and connections to other fields. At the heart of the Langlands Programme is the concept of an L-function. The most famous L-function is the Riemann zeta function, and as well as being ubiquitous in number theory itself, L-functions have applications in mathematical physics and cryptography. Two of the seven Clay Mathematics Million Dollar Millennium Problems, the Riemann Hypothesis and the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, deal with their properties. Many different mathematical objects are connected in various ways to L-functions, but the study of those objects is highly specialized, and most mathematicians have only a vague idea of the objects outside their specialty and how everything is related. Helping mathematicians to understand these connections was the motivation for the L-functions and Modular Forms Database (LMFDB) project. Its mission is to chart the landscape of L-functions and modular forms in a systematic, comprehensive, and concrete fashion. This involves developing their theory, creating and improving algorithms for computing and classifying them, and hence discovering new properties of these functions, and testing fundamental conjectures. In the lecture I gave a very brief introduction to L-functions for non-experts and explained and demonstrated how the large collection of data in the LMFDB is organized and displayed, showing the interrelations between linked objects, through our website www.lmfdb.org. I also showed how this has been created by a worldwide open-source collaboration, which we hope may become a model for others.",57
"Several conflicting criteria exist in building design optimization, especially energy consumption and indoor environment thermal performance. This paper presents a novel multi-objective optimization model that can assist designers in green building design. The Pareto solution was used to obtain a set of optimal solutions for building design optimization, and uses an improved multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) as a theoretical basis for building design multi-objective optimization model. Based on the simulation data on energy consumption and indoor thermal comfort, the study also used a simulation-based improved back-propagation (BP) network which is optimized by a genetic algorithm (GA) to characterize building behavior, and then establishes a GA-BP network model for rapidly predicting the energy consumption and indoor thermal comfort status of residential buildings; Third, the building design multi-objective optimization model was established by using the GA-BP network as a fitness function of the multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II); Finally, a case study is presented with the aid of the multi-objective approach in which dozens of potential designs are revealed for a typical building design in China, with a wide range of trade-offs between thermal comfort and energy consumption.

"The paper considers a realization of quasi-sliding mode control for DC-DC boost-type converter on ATmega8 microcontroller. The proposed control law represents a combination of discretetime sliding mode and generalized minimum variance control techniques. The control design is based on input-output converter model and only the sensed output voltage is used for generating control signal. This approach simplifes the practical realization of boost converter since there is no need for current sensors. By introducing an additional discrete-time integrator in control, the converter accuracy in steady-state under load and input voltage variations is enhanced. The experimental prototype is developed and several experiments are conducted to validate the functionalities of the proposed solution. The maximum load and line regulation errors of the proposed converter are 1.55% and 2.9%, respectively.",51
"Objective: Although the majority of women with serious mental illnesses (SMI) are mothers, limited research is available on the relationship between maternal SMI and pediatric health care use. Adherence with preventive care is associated not only with improved children's health and well-being but also decreased costs to the health care system. This study examines the relationship between maternal psychotic disorders (PDs) and pediatric health care. Method: This retrospective secondary analysis of Medicaid claims compares age cohorts of children (0 to 4 years) of mothers with and without PDs. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models are used to examine established measures of pediatric preventive care and emergency department (ED) care among 297,866 mother-child dyads. Results: Adherence to preventive care guidelines ranged from 19% to 34% among mothers with PDs and from 24% to 32% among mothers without PDs. Mothers with PDs are 1.41 times more likely to have at least one preventive care visit in Year 0-1 (95% CI [1.20, 1.65], p < 0.0001); 0.67 times less likely to have at least one visit in Year 3-4 (95 % CI [0.54, 0.82], p < .0001); and significantly more likely to have high ED reliance for their children ages 0 to 2 years (p < .01). Conclusions: Few differences existed in pediatric health care use among Medicaid-insured mothers with and without PDs. Although preventive pediatric health care use among mothers with PDs is comparable with that of mothers without PDs, mothers with mental illness could still benefit from targeted strategies to reduce ED reliance for their young children (0 to 2 years). Social work involvement with all families living in poverty should help these families access and use preventive care for young children.",117
"Purpose: During the toddler years, temper tantrums and impulsive behaviors are the norm. These behaviors can frustrate even the most experienced mothers. Design and Methods: A prospective, double blind, randomized controlled trial using pre-test/post-test experimental design was used to examine the effectiveness of an office-based educational program to improve maternal confidence and the social-emotional development of toddlers. The Toddler Care Questionnaire (TCQ) was administered to all mothers as a pre and post intervention test. The treatment intervention was a videotaped (DVD) parenting skills intervention on the social-emotional development of toddlers and onmaternal confidence in caring for toddlers. Results: Sixty mothers and 60 toddlers entered the study with 29 mothertoddler dyads randomized to the treatment group and 31 to the control group. Twenty-six (26) mother-toddler dyads in the treatment and 25 mother-toddler dyads in the control group completed the study. Pairwise comparisons of adjusted means showed significant improvements for both toddler groups on the Brigance toddler screen, and no statistically significant difference in gains between the groups. The mixed model results for the TCQ showed an overall significant improvement from preto post-test, and a non-significant interaction between group and time indicting no significant difference in gains seen by treatment groups. Conclusions: Brief educational programs on DVD's are an efficient way to offer information to mothers while in the office waiting area. Practice Implications: Pediatric nurses who encounter mothers who struggle with caring for their toddlers may find brief-office based interventions a valuable tool for educating parents.

"Background: Alstonia scholaris (L.) R. Br. (Apocynaceae), an important herbal medicine, has been widely used to treat respiratory tract diseases, such as cough, asthma, phlegm, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Purpose: To evaluate pharmacological effect of alkaloids from A. scholaris on ovalbumin induced airways allergic inflammatory model, and explore whether the dosing frequency is related to pharmacokinetics. Study design: After oral administration of total alkaloids, the pharmacokinetic study of it was investigated. In addition, anti-allergic studies were carried out on ovalbumin-sensitized airways allergic inflammatory model of mice. Methods: The pharmacokinetics of total alkaloids (TA) was investigated in SD rat plasma by a fully-validated LC-MS/MS method. Then, an ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized airways allergic inflammatory model was established, in which mice were intra-gastrically administrated by 3 times a day (8.3 and 16.7 mg/kg) based on the pharmacokinetic behavior of TA) and single (25, 50 mg/kg) treatment regimen. Dexamethasone was used as a positive control for corticosteroid drugs. Cellular infiltration was assessed in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Expressions of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) in the BALF were determined, levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE) and eotaxin in serum were measured, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the serum and BALF were examined. Finally, histopathological examination in the lung was assessed by H. E. staining. Results: The time course of plasma concentration of 4 bioactive indole alkaloids fitted an open two-compartment model after oral administration of total alkaloids at doses of 10, 25, and 50 mg/kg. The area under the curve and the maximum concentration values of four major alkaloids increased dose-dependently, and half-life suggested a short-lasting pharmacological effect. Then, an ovalbumin-provoked airways allergic inflammatory model indicated that the pharmacological effect of administration of total alkaloids 3 times a day was a little better than that of single dose daily. The percentage of eosinophils in BALF was reduced obviously and the pathological damage of lung was also attenuated. There was also a significant reduction in IL-4 and promotion in IL-10 in the BALF. Serum IgE and eotaxin expression also significantly decreased in treated animals. Furthermore, the activity of SOD elevated remarkably and lipid peroxidation product (MDA) decreased in the administrated mice. Conclusion: The pharmacological effects administrated for 3 times a day had precedence over single dose daily, which was related to the prolonged retention time and the maintained plasma concentration. Moreover, scholaricine and vallesamine might be responsible for the treatment of allergic asthma, mainly in total alkaloids. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.",109
"Objective: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of subclinical enthesopathy in patients with psoriasis using power Doppler ultrasonography (PDUS) and its association with other disease parameters. Material and Methods: A total of 50 patients with psoriasis (31 females) aged 19-70 years underwent a thorough clinical examination that included assessment of body mass index (BMI) and psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score. Measurements of inflammatory markers, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum uric acid, and plain radiography of the heels, knees, and sacroiliac joints were performed for all patients. Patients without clinical evidence of arthritis or enthesitis underwent an ultrasonographic (US) examination. According to the US examination, patients were classified into group I (patients with enthesitis) and group II (patients without enthesitis). Results: In group I, Achilles enthesis was the most common site of US enthesitis (33.3%), followed by distal patellar enthesis (22.2%), proximal patellar enthesis (16.7%), quadriceps enthesis (16.7%), and plantar aponeurosis enthesis (11.1%). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between the occurrence of enthesitis and the patient's age, disease duration, PASI score, BMI, and hyperuricemia (p0.05 for each). Conclusion: In addition to the importance of PDUS as a complimentary tool for examining enthesis in patients with psoriasis, the presence of high PASI score, increased BMI and hyperuricemia, and a long disease duration can be considered as predictive parameters for the presence of psoriatic enthesitis.",21
"Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare multisystem connective tissue disorder characterized by the triad fibrosis, vasculopathy and immune dysregulation. This chronic disease has a significant impact on the orofacial region that is involved in more than two-thirds of the cases. SSc patients can show a wide array of oral manifestations, which are usually associated with a severe impairment of the quality of life. They often present a decreased the salivary flow and a reduced mouth opening that contribute substantially to the worsening of the oral health status. Therefore, SSc patients require specific and multidisciplinary interventions that should be initiated as early as possible. The identification of specific radiological and clinical signs at the early stage will improve the management of such patients. This study reviews the wide spectrum of orofacial manifestations associated with SSc and suggests clues for the oral management that remains challenging.",23
"One-dimensional bimetallic nanowires were introduced into TiO2-based matrix to enhance their photocatalysis efficiency and expand their light absorption range in this work. Recently, metal nanowires have attracted many attention in photocatalyst research fields because of their favorable electronic transmission properties and especially in the aspect of surface plasmon resonance effects. Moreover, Cu-Ni bimetallic nanowires (Cu-Ni NWs) have shown better chemical stability than ordinary monometallic nanowires in our recent works. Interestingly, it has been found that Ni sleeves of the bimetallic nanowires also can modify the Schottky barrier of interface between TiO2 and metallic conductor, so that be beneficial to the separation of photogenerated carriers in the Cu-Ni/TiO2 network topology. Hence, a novel heterostructured photocatalyst composed of Cu-Ni NWs and TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) was fabricated by one-step hydrolysis approach to explore its photocatalytic performance. TEM and EDX mapping images of this TiO2 NPs @Cu-Ni NWs (TCN) hybrid displayed that Cu-Ni NWs were wrapped by compact TiO2 layer and retained the one-dimensional structure in matrix. In experiments, the photocatalytic performance of the TCN nanocomposite was significantly enhanced comparing to pure TiO2. Acetaldehyde, as a common gas pollutant in the environment, was employed to evaluate the photodegradation efficiency of a series of TCN nanocomposites under continuous feeding. The TCN exhibited excellent potodegradation performance, where the dynamic photocatalytic efficiency of TCN containing 3 wt% Cu-Ni NWs was about 88% and 56% (continuous 500 ppm CH3CHO feeding, 20 SCCM) under UV and visible light, respectively. ESR results proved that the recombination of photo -generated electron -hole pairs was inhibited significantly in TCN nanocomposite. Finally, the mechanism for electron -hole pairs' separation and transmission at Schottky barrier interface between Cu-Ni NWs and TiO2 layers has been proposed based on the above analyses.

"Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency, adverse effects, and pharmacoeconomic impact of empirical and preemptive antifungal therapy for febrile neutropenic hematological malignancy patients in China. Material/Methods: Patients with febrile neutropenia during hematological malignancy were randomly divided into an empirical group and a preemptive group. The preemptive antifungal treatment was initiated if patient status was confirmed by clinical manifestation, imaging diagnosis, 1-3-beta-D glucan(G) testing, and galactomannan (GM) test. The treatment was ended 2 weeks later if the patient was recovered from neutropenia. Voriconazole was used as the first-line medicine. All patients received intravenous administration of voriconazole every 12 h, with an initiating dose of 400 mg, then the dose was reduced to 200 mg. Results: The overall survival rate was 97.1% and 94.6% in the empirical group and preemptive group, respectively, with no significant difference observed (chi(2)=1.051, P=0.305). However, the occurrence rate of invasive fungal disease (IFD) in the preemptive group was 9.2% vs. 2.2% in the empirical group. Moreover, the mortality rate due to IFD was 0.7% and 2.3% for the empirical group and preemptive group, respectively. The average duration and cost of preemptive antifungal therapy were 13.8 +/- 4.7 days and 8379.00 +/- 2253.00 RMB, respectively, which were lower than for empirical therapy. However, no significant differences were observed for incidence of adverse effects and hospital stay between the 2 groups. Conclusions: Preemptive antifungal therapy for patients with febrile neutropenic hematological malignancy demonstrated a similar survival rate as with empirical therapy but is economically favorable in a Chinese population.",126

"Despite the high prevalence and impact on quality of life, costs, and survival, there are still unresolved issues regarding diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN): the lack of definite knowledge of its pathogenesis; the limited preventive action of glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes; and the unavailability of evidence-based effective disease-modifying treatment. How can genetics provide the tools to address these gaps? Ziegler et al for the GDS Group explore the novel hypothesis that genetic variability in transketolase (TKT) might contribute to susceptibility to DPN in patients with newly diagnosed type 1 and type 2 diabetes (well characterised for DPN). Transketolase diverts excess glycolytic metabolites from the hexosamine, protein kinase C, and advanced glycation endproduct pathways to the pentose phosphate pathway, with a protective effect against hyperglycaemia-induced damage. Moreover, thiamine and its derivative benfotiamine are among the few disease-modifying agents still under consideration as DPN treatment. The authors find significant associations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the TKT gene with the Total Symptom Score and thermal thresholds, in particular in male participants with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, they measure plasma methylglyoxal (a glycating agent, whose availability is hindered by TKT) without however finding a relation with TKT single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The link found between TKT genetic variability and nerve function measures is considered here in the context of DPN genetic studies and of experimental and clinical findings regarding thiamine and benfotiamine. The conclusion is that available data supports the decision to maintain focus on both the search for DPN genetic biomarkers and the therapeutic attempts to target thiamine, TKT, and methylglyoxal.",120
"In this article, a conceptual design with its architecture of a broadband, vibration-based, nonlinear energy harvester is reported. Its non-linear behavior and its functionality are presented. Compared to that provided by conventional linear beam type of energy harvesters, this nonlinear harvester can provide widen the resonance frequency ranges. Hence, it can collect more vibration energy generated at various dominant rotational frequencies of a rotary machine. A smart material, called Magneto Rheological Elastomer (MRE), was added to the usual beam structured energy harvester. Since MRE is one of the magnetic smart materials, of which their stiffness can be tuned by precisely controlling the applied magnetic field, the stiffness of the combined piezoelectric beam with MRE becomes adjustable. Because of the adjustable stiffness, the resonance frequency of the new beam type energy harvester can be adaptively changed to match with a particular dominant rotational frequency generated by the monitored machine so that maximum vibration energy can be harvested. Moreover, due to the nonlinearity of the new composite beam structure, the range of resonance frequency range can be widened to make it easier to adapt a slightly varying dominant rotational frequency due to the monitored machine has small speed variation. Besides the presentation of design and its with its architecture in the article, the simulated and experimental results of the new non-linear harvester are also reported here. From the comparison study of the bandwidth and the output power generated by the new nonlinear energy harvester against that generated from conventional harvester, the result shows that new non-linear harvester is functioning superior to that of the conventional harvesters.",103
"BRCA mutation carriers have a very high risk of breast and ovarian cancer by age 70, in the ranges 47%-66% and 40%-57%, respectively. Additionally, women with BRCA mutation-associated breast cancer also have an elevated risk of other or secondary malignancies. Fortunately, the breast and ovarian cancer outcome for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers is at least as good as for non-carriers with chemoprevention, prophylactic surgeries and appropriate use of therapies. Therefore, identification of those who might have a mutation is important so that genetic counseling, testing, screening and prevention strategies can be applied in a timely manner. This article reviews the impact of genetic testing in general, timing of genetic testing after diagnosis and prior knowledge of mutation status in BRCA carriers with newly diagnosed breast cancer. Additionally, risk-reducing surgeries including the prophylactic contralateral mastectomy, and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and the sensitivity of BRCA-defective breast cancer cell lines to differential chemotherapeutic agents will be discussed.

"Background: Age-related decline in kidney function can be an important risk factor for cognitive impairment in older adults. In this study, we examined several kidney function measures for the association with cognitive function in older adults in hope to identify early and sensitive markers that can be used for the detection or screening for cognitive impairment. Methods: A total of 1982 older participants (aged years) in the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was analyzed for the association between kidney function and cognitive impairment using multivariate logistic regression and general linear models. Cognitive functioning was assessed during the household interview using a version of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III. In our study, participants with a score of <31, the 25th percentiles of the distribution, or who were unable to complete the sample exercise due to cognitive limitations were classified as having cognitive impairment. Results: Of 1982 older adults, 503 were having cognitive impairment (weighted prevalence, 15.38%). Among the kidney function measures that we examined, the levels of serum cystatin C and urinary albumin were found being significantly associated with cognitive impairment after adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, poverty status, education, physical activity, BMI, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption. Cognitive functioning scores were significantly decreasing with increasing levels of kidney dysfunction markers. Conclusion: Serum cystatin C and urinary albumin that are early markers of chronic kidney disease might serve as early and effective markers for cognitive decline in older adults. Mechanisms underlying the observed association need to be further characterized. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",119
"Trichoderma harzianum is a mycoparasitic filamentous fungus that produces and secretes a wide range of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes used in cell wall degradation. Due to its potential in biomass conversion, T. harzianum draws great attention from biofuel and biocontrol industries and research. Here, we report an extensive secretome analysis of T. harzianum. The fungus was grown on cellulose medium, and its secretome was analyzed by a combination of enzymology, 2DE, MALDI-MS and -MS/MS (Autoflex II), and LC-MS/MS (LTQ-Orbitrap XL). A total of 56 proteins were identified using high-resolution MS. Interestingly, although cellulases were found, the major hydrolytic enzymes secreted in the cellulose medium were chitinases and endochitinases, which may reflect the biocontrol feature of T. harzianum. The glycoside hydrolase family, including chitinases (EC 3.2.1.14), endo-N-acetylglucosaminidases (EC 3.2.1.96), hexosaminidases (EC 3.2.1.52), galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23), xylanases (EC 3.2.1.8), exo-1,3-glucanases (EC 3.2.1.58), endoglucanases (EC 3.2.1.4), xylosidases (EC 3.2.1.37), a-L-arabinofuranosidase (EC 3.2.1.55), N-acetylhexosaminidases (EC 3.2.1.52), and other enzymes represented 51.36% of the total secretome. Few representatives were classified in the protease family (8.90%). Others (17.60%) are mostly intracellular proteins. A considerable part of the secretome was composed of hypothetical proteins (22.14%), probably because of the absence of an annotated T. harzianum genome. The T. harzianum secretome composition highlights the importance of this fungus as a rich source of hydrolytic enzymes for bioconversion and biocontrol applications.",36
"Background: A large amount of research has been devoted to the detection and investigation of epistatic interactions in genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Most of the literature focuses on low-order interactions between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with significant main effects. Results: In this paper we propose an original approach for detecting epistasis at the gene level, without systematically filtering on significant genes. We first compute interaction variables for each gene pair by finding its Eigen-Epistasis component, defined as the linear combination of Gene SNPs having the highest correlation with the phenotype. The selection of significant effects is done using a penalized regression method based on Group Lasso controlling the False Discovery Rate. Conclusion: The method is tested against two recent alternative proposals from the literature using synthetic data, and shows good performances in different settings. We demonstrate the power of our approach by detecting new gene-gene interactions on three genome-wide association studies.",107
"Background: Despite several polysomnographic studies on periodic leg movements (PLM) in healthy sleep, data on the prevalence and characteristics of periodic arm movements (PAM) in normal subjects are lacking. We aimed to investigate PAM and their association with PLM during wakefulness and sleep in healthy subjects. Methods: Ninety-one participants underwent video-polysomnography according to American Academy of Sleep Medicine 2007 criteria. In addition to standard electromyographic registration, data for both flexor digitorum superficialis muscles were recorded. Results: Sixty-two subjects (68.1%) had a PAM index during wakefulness >5/h (median PAM index during wakefulness, 8.8/h; range, 0-77). Seven subjects (7.7%) had a PAM index >5/h during sleep (median PAM index during sleep, 0.7/h; range, 0-47.4). In 14% of cases, PAM during wakefulness were coincident with PLM during wakefulness. During sleep, this coincidence was not evident. The correlation between PAM and PLM was weak to moderate (during wakefulness: Spearman's rho = 0.576, P < 0.001; during sleep: Spearman's rho = 0.222, P = 0.036). Conclusion: In healthy subjects, PAM occur predominantly during wakefulness with no apparent true periodicity. In contrast to classical PLM, some PAM may not present a true periodic phenomenon, but rather random voluntary movements meeting the wide range of periodicity criteria for PLM. (C) 2014 The Authors.

"Many changes in nature do not directly threaten humans, but do negatively influence nature itself, thereby posing an ""impersonal"" risk. We examine the optimistic bias (OB) for an impersonal risk, the first-person perception (FPP) of an impersonal risk, and the influence of media reporting and proximity of an impersonal risk on FPP and OB. Finally, we investigate the relationship between OB and FPP. We conducted a field experiment (N = 479) in 12 German cities where an invasive moth species had infested culturally important horse chestnut trees. We found OB for this nature change that decreased for people living in an area subject to this impersonal nature risk. After the treatments, neither the proximity of impersonal risk nor the journalistic style of media reporting had a significant effect on OB. An FPP was found that was not influenced significantly by either different journalistic styles or the proximity of impersonal risk. A nonsignificant swap-in-signs relation between OB and FPP was found depending on journalistic style.",63
"Halophiles are excellent sources of enzymes that are not only salt stable but also can withstand and carry out reactions efficiently under extreme conditions. The aim of the study was to isolate and study the diversity among halophilic bacteria producing enzymes of industrial value. Screening of halophiles from various saline habitats of India led to isolation of 108 halophilic bacteria producing industrially important hydrolases (amylases, lipases and proteases). Characterization of 21 potential isolates by morphological, biochemical and 16S rRNA gene analysis found them related to Marinobacter, Virgibacillus, Halobacillus, Geomicrobium, Chromohalobacter, Oceanobacillus, Bacillus, Halomonas and Staphylococcus genera. They belonged to moderately halophilic group of bacteria exhibiting salt requirement in the range of 3-20%. There is significant diversity among halophiles from saline habitats of India. Preliminary characterization of crude hydrolases established them to be active and stable under more than one extreme condition of high salt, pH, temperature and presence of organic solvents. It is concluded that these halophilic isolates are not only diverse in phylogeny but also in their enzyme characteristics. Their enzymes may be potentially useful for catalysis under harsh operational conditions encountered in industrial processes. The solvent stability among halophilic enzymes seems a generic novel feature making them potentially useful in non-aqueous enzymology.",36
"Study Objectives: To determine the association between common genetic variation in the clock gene pathway and objectively measured actigraphic sleep and activity rhythm traits. Design: Genetic association study in two population-based cohorts of elderly participants: the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF) and the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) study. Setting: Population-based. Participants: SOF participants (n = 1,407, 100% female, mean age 84 years) and MrOS participants (n = 2,527, 100% male, mean age 77 years) with actigraphy and genotype data. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and Results: Common genetic variation in 30 candidate genes was captured using 529 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Sleep and activity rhythm traits were objectively measured using wrist actigraphy. In a region of high linkage disequilibrium on chromosome 12p13 containing the candidate gene GNB3, the rs1047776 A allele and the rs2238114 C allele were significantly associated with higher wake after sleep onset (meta-analysis: rs1047776 P-ADD = 2 x 10(-5), rs2238114 P-ADD = 5 x 10(-5)) and lower LRRC23 gene expression (rs1047776:. = -0.22, P = 0.02; rs2238114:. = -0.50, P = 5 x 10(-8)). In MrOS participants, SNPs in ARNTL and NPAS2, genes coding for binding partners, were associated with later sleep and wake onset time (sleep onset time: ARNTL rs3816358 P-2DF = 1 x 10(-4), NPAS2 rs3768984 P-2DF = 5 x 10(-5); wake onset time: rs3816358 P-2DF = 3 x 10(-3), rs3768984 P-2DF = 2 x 10(-4)) and the SNP interaction was significant (sleep onset time P-INT = 0.003, wake onset time P-INT = 0.001). A SNP association in the CLOCK gene replicated in the MrOS cohort, and rs3768984 was associated with sleep duration in a previously reported study. Cluster analysis identified four clusters of genetic associations. Conclusions: These findings support a role for common genetic variation in clock genes in the regulation of inter-related sleep traits in the elderly.",71
"Introduction: The use of beta emitters is one of the effective methods for palliation of bone metastasis. The risk of normal tissue toxicity should be evaluated in the bone pain palliation treatment. Methods: In this study, the Monte Carlo simulation code MCNPX was used for simulation a bone phantom model consisted of bone marrow, bone and soft tissue. Specific absorbed fractions were calculated for monoenergetic electrons, photons and eight beta emitters: P-32, Sr-89, Y-90, Sm-153, Ho-166, Lu-177, Re-186 and Re-188. Beta and gamma S-factor, absorbed dose and cumulative dose of mentioned radionuclides were obtained to the selection of radionuclides with optimal radiation characteristics. Results: The results show Lu-177 gives a higher local dose to source organ. Lu-177 has fewer side effects on critical organ including bone marrow in comparison with other radionuclides such as Sr-89, P-32 and Y-90. Cumulative dose versus time shows after a long time, long half-life radionuclides delivering a higher dose in comparison with the short-half radionuclides. Conclusion: According to the results, low energy beta-emitters(177)Lu, Sm-153 and Re-186 can be used for bone pain palliation especially in vertebra. Different combination of these radionuclides can be used to improving therapeutic effects for tumors with different size.",14
"High resolution reconstruction technology is developed to help enhance the spatial resolution of observational images for ground-based solar telescopes, such as speckle masking. Near real-time reconstruction performance is achieved on a high performance cluster using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). However, much time is spent in reconstructing solar subimages in such a speckle reconstruction. We design and implement a novel parallel method for speckle masking reconstruction of solar subimage on a shared memory machine using the OpenMP. Real tests are performed to verify the correctness of our codes. We present the details of several parallel reconstruction steps. The parallel implementation between various modules shows a great speed increase as compared to single thread serial implementation, and a speedup of about 2.5 is achieved in one subimage reconstruction. The timing result for reconstructing one subimage with 256 x 256 pixels shows a clear advantage with greater number of threads. This novel parallel method can be valuable in real-time reconstruction of solar images, especially after porting to a high performance cluster.",101
"Background Accurate workplace injury data are useful in the prioritization of prevention strategies. In the UK, physicians report workplace ill-health data within The Health and Occupation Research (THOR) network, including injury case reports. Aims To compare workplace injury data reported by occupational physicians (OPs) and general practitioners (GPs) to THOR. Methods Injury cases reported by OPs and GPs, reported to THOR between 2006 and 2012 were analysed. Demographics, industrial groups, nature of injury, kind of accident and site of injury were compared. Data on sickness absence for workplace injuries reported by GPs were investigated. Results In total, 2017 workplace injury cases were reported by OPs and GPs. Males were more likely to sustain a workplace accident than females. Sprains and strains were reported most often, with the upper limbs being affected most frequently. Slips, trips and falls were identified as important causal factors by both OPs and GPs. Psychological injuries also featured in THOR reporting, with a higher proportion reported by OPs (21%) than by GPs (3%). The proportion of people classified as 'unfit' by GPs reduced following the introduction of the 'fit' note. Conclusions THOR reports returned by OPs and GPs provide a valuable source of information of workplace injury data, and complement other sources of information, such as the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations and the Labour Force Survey.",28
"We propose and explore the applicability of file timestamps as a steganographic channel. We identify an information gap between storage and usage of timestamps in modern operating systems that use high-precision timers. Building on this, we describe a layered design of a steganographic system that offers stealthiness, robustness, and wide applicability. The proposed design is evaluated through theoretical, evidence-based, and experimental analysis for the case of NTFS using datasets comprising millions of files. We report a proof-of-concept implementation and confirm that the embedded information is indistinguishable from that of a normal filesystem use. Finally, we discuss the digital forensics analysis implications of this new information-hiding technique. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.",68
"Electrorheological fluid (ERF) is a smart material which can transpose from liquid-like state to solid-like state under the action of electric field, along with this process, the physical properties of the material will be changed like apparent viscosity, yield stress and acoustic impendence.

"Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller design based on the Gaussian process (GP) model is proposed in this study. The GP model, defined by its mean and covariance function, provides predictive variance in addition to the predicted mean. GP model highlights areas where prediction quality is poor, due to the lack of data, by indicating the higher variance around the predicted mean. The variance information is taken into account in the PID controller design and is used for the selection of data to improve the model at the successive stage. This results in a trade-off between safety and the performance due to the controller avoiding the region with large variance at the cost of not tracking the set point to ensure process safety. The proposed direct method evaluates the PID controller design by the gradient calculation. In order to reduce computation the characteristic of the instantaneous linearized GP model is extracted for a linearized framework of PID controller design. Two case studies on continuous and batch processes were carried out to illustrate the applicability of the proposed method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",59
"Teenage birth rates among young people aged 15-19 years in California, USA, have declined from 47 births per 1000 in 2000 to 24 per 1000 in 2013. Nevertheless, the US counties with the highest teenage birth rates are predominantly rural and have a high proportion of Latinos/as. We conducted 42 interviews with key stakeholders and 12 focus groups with 107 young people in five rural communities to better understand local migration patterns and their influence on intermediate and proximate variables of pregnancy, such as interaction with role models and barriers to access contraception. The migration patterns identified were: residential mobility due to seasonal jobs, residential mobility due to economic and housing changes and migration from other countries to California. These patterns affect young people and families' interactions with school and health systems and other community members, creating both opportunities and barriers to prevent risky sexual behaviours. In rural areas, residential mobility and migration to the USA interconnect. As a result, young people dually navigate the challenges of residential mobility, while also adapting to the dominant US culture. It is important to promote programmes that support the integration of immigrant youth to reduce their sense of isolation, as well as to assure access to sexual health education and reproductive health services.",124
"Education in the Department of the Built Environment (Eindhoven University of Technology) aims to prepare students for multidisciplinary design teams. The Bachelor program offers a broad range incorporating essentials of urbanism, architecture, structure, building physics, real estate, construction, services et cetera. This broad BSc program lays a foundation for students and is followed by a Master program that focuses on specialization. There are six specializations: Architecture, Urban Design & Planning, Structural Design, Building Physics & Services, Real Estate Management & Development and Construction Management & Engineering. Multidisciplinary in the BSc is more than offering a variety of knowledge in courses and lectures. The Department also puts a lot of effort to train students to gain experiences in integral design teams. This takes shape in studios but is best expressed in the Multi-project (a semester assignment in the last year of the Bachelor). This assignment is organized by 9 coaches (from all specializations in the Master). The assessment is always a practice-based issue, and students have to cooperate as a design team during one semester Developing the Multi-project has been a long route that took place over many years with several adjustments according to experiences and information gathered by student inquiries. This paper gives a very global overview of the present setup to contextualize this assignment. After that, the main part of this paper focuses on the kickoff (first 2-3 weeks). Here students start in parallel studios, meant to put them on track for integral design. Each studio combines two disciplines and compels students to precede design by analyzing all kind of issues in the light of the specific assignment. Because of the complexity of this assignment we frequently ask students to fill in an enquiry. Because of this we are now able to draw conclusions from major changes during the last 70-74 assignments (2007 2013).",102
"The purpose of this manuscript is to describe a collaborative research initiative to explore the role of hydration in kidney health. Our understanding of the effects of hydration in health and disease is surprisingly limited, particularly when we consider the vital role of hydration in basic human physiology. Recent initiatives and research outcomes have challenged the global medical community to expand our knowledge about hydration, including the differences between water, sugared beverages and other consumables. Identification of the potential mechanisms contributing to the benefits of hydration has stimulated the global nephrology community to advance research regarding hydration for kidney health. Hydration and kidney health has been a focus of research for several research centers with a rapidly expanding world literature and knowledge. The International Society of Nephrology has collaborated with Danone Nutricia Research to promote development of kidney research initiatives, which focus on the role of hydration in kidney health and the global translation of this new information. This initiative supports the use of existing data in different regions and countries to expand dialogue among experts in the field of hydration and health, and to increase scientific interaction and productivity with the ultimate goal of improving kidney health.

"Cellular membranes display a diversity of functions that are conferred by the unique composition and organization of their proteins and lipids. One important aspect of lipid organization is the asymmetric distribution of phospholipids (PLs) across the plasma membrane. The unequal distribution of key PLs between the cytofacial and exofacial leaflets of the bilayer creates physical surface tension that can be used to bend the membrane; and like Ca2+, a chemical gradient that can be used to transduce biochemical signals. PL flippases in the type IV P-type ATPase (P4-ATPase) family are the principle transporters used to set and repair this PL gradient and the asymmetric organization of these membranes are encoded by the substrate specificity of these enzymes. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of P4-ATPase substrate specificity will help reveal their role in membrane organization and cell biology. Further, decoding the structural determinants of substrate specificity provides investigators the opportunity to mutationally tune this specificity to explore the role of particular PL substrates in P4-ATPase cellular functions. This work reviews the role of P4-ATPases in membrane biology, presents our current understanding of P4-ATPase substrate specificity, and discusses how these fundamental aspects of P4-ATPase enzymology may be used to enhance our knowledge of cellular membrane biology.",31
"Generalized coupled-line all-pass phasers, based on cascaded C-sections (CCSs), cascaded coupled-lines (CCLs), and hybrid-cascaded (HC) coupled transmission-line sections, are presented and demonstrated using analytical, full-wave, and experimental results. It is shown that for N commensurate coupled-line sections, CCL and HC phasers exhibit N group-delay peaks per coupled-line section harmonic frequency band, in contrast to the CCS configuration, which exhibits only one peak within this band. It is also shown that for a given maximum achievable coupling-coefficient, the HC configuration provides the largest group-delay swing. A wave-interference analysis is finally applied to the various coupled-line phasers, explaining their unique group-delay characteristics based on physical wave-propagation mechanisms.",52
"XML is a pervasive technology for representing and accessing semi-structured data. XPath is the standard language for navigational queries on XML documents and there is a growing demand for its efficient processing. In order to increase the efficiency in executing four navigational XML query primitives, namely descendants, ancestors, children and parent, we introduce a new paradigm where traditional approaches based on the efficient traversing of nodes and edges to reconstruct the requested subtrees are replaced by a brand new one based on basic set operations which allow us to directly return the desired subtree, avoiding to create it passing through nodes and edges. Our solution stems from the NEsted SeTs for Object hieRarchies (NEASTOR) formal model, which makes use of set-inclusion relations for representing and providing access to hierarchical data. We define in-memory efficient data structures to implement NESTOR, we develop algorithms to perform the descendants, ancestors, children and parent query primitives and we study their computational complexity. We conduct an extensive experimental evaluation by using several datasets: digital archives (EAD collections), INEX 2009 Wikipedia collection, and two widely-used synthetic datasets (XMark and XGen). We show that NESTOR-based data structures and query primitives consistently outperform state-of-the-art solutions for XPath processing at execution time and they are competitive in terms of both memory occupation and pre-processing time.

"Airborne Lidar bathymetry (ALB) is an effective and a rapidly advancing technology for mapping and characterizing shallow coastal water zones as well as inland fresh-water basins such as rivers and lakes. The ability of light beams to detect and traverse shallow water columns has provided valuable information about unmapped and often poorly understood coastal and inland water bodies of the world. Estimating ALB survey results at varying water clarity and depth conditions is essential for realizing project expectations and preparing budgets accordingly. In remote locations of the world where in situ water clarity measurements are not feasible or possible, using multiband satellite imagery can be an effective tool for estimating and addressing such considerations. For this purpose, we studied and classified reflected electromagnetic energy from selected water bodies acquired by RapidEye sensor and then correlated findings with ALB survey results. This study was focused not on accurately measuring depth from optical bathymetry but rather on using multiband satellite imagery to quickly predict ALB survey results and identify potentially turbid water bodies with limited depth penetration. For this study, we constructed an in-house algorithm to confirm ALB survey findings using bathymetric waveform information. The study findings are expected to contribute to the ongoing understanding of forecasting ALB survey expectations in unknown and varying water conditions, especially in remote and inaccessible parts of the world.

"Introduction: An increasing number of patients with congenital heart disease are now surviving into adulthood. This has also led to the emergence of complications from the underlying congenital heart disease, related surgical interventions, and associated combordities. While the prevalence of particular arrhythmias with specific congenital heart disease has been previously described, a detailed analysis of all lesions and a large number of comorbidities has not been previously published. Methods: Admissions with congenital heart disease were identified in the National Inpatient Sample. Associated comorbidities were also identified for these patients. Univariate analysis was done to compare those risk factors associated with specific arrhythmias in the setting of congenital heart disease. Next, regression analysis was done to identify what patient characteristics and comorbidities were associated with increased risk of specific arrhythmias. Results: A total of 52,725,227 admissions were included in the analysis. Of these, 109,168 (0.21%) had congenital heart disease. Of those with congenital heart disease, 27,088 (25%) had an arrhythmia at some point. The most common arrhythmia in those with congenital heart disease was atrial fibrillation, which was noted in 86% of those with arrhythmia followed by atrial flutter which was noted in 20% of those with congenital heart disease. The largest burden of arrhythmia was found to be in those with tricuspid atresia with a 51% prevalence of arrhythmia in this group followed by Ebstein anomaly which had an arrhythmia prevalence of 39%. Increasing age, male gender, double outlet right ventricle, atrioventricular septal defect, heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, transposition of the great arteries, congenitally corrected transposition, and tetralogy of Fallot were frequently noted to be independent risk factors of specific arrhythmias. Conclusion: Approximately, 25% of adult admissions with congenital heart disease are associated with arrhythmia. The burden of arrhythmia varies by the specific lesion and other risk factors as well. Understanding of these can help in risk stratification and can help devise strategies to lower this risk.",111
"There is a growing need for an electrical generation and distribution system for modern commercial aircraft. In the field of aviation, there is a trend towards more electric aircraft', which implies the substitution of the hydraulic and pneumatic systems by electrical ones. This trend, in effect, results in an increasing demand for energy. In aircraft construction, there is a state-of-the-art inflexible point-to-point supply of loads based on a complex and expensive electric load analysis. Connecting the load to different feeders during flights is not possible because of rigid wiring.The article introduces modern concepts for improving the electrical distribution systemnamely feeder balancing and phase balancing. These methods involve utilizing intelligent switching nodes based on power semiconductor devices. The concepts allow for a reallocation of electrical loads on different power feeders. The article will also present an analysis of the integration of a multifunctional fuel cell system with a focus on the necessary changes in the electrical network of an aircraft. In less than a decade's time, commercial aircraft could use low-temperature fuel cells to substitute the auxiliary power unit and the ram air turbine, which is used in ground phases and in cases of turbine failure. Using fuel, cells could aid in constructing a completely different layout of the electrical network implementing a +/- 270 V DC voltage level. The increasing electrical demand of aircraft requires an energy-efficient power supply network. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",50

"Objective To identify knowledge of and attitudes towards emergency contraception (EC) in women from five European countries. Methods In an internet-based survey, sexually active women aged 16 to 46 years from France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK were asked about their use of and opinions on EC. Results Overall, 7170 women completed the survey. Thirty percent reported having had unprotected sexual intercourse during the previous 12 months (population at risk). Twenty-four percent of the population at-risk reported using EC. The most common reasons given for not using EC were: not perceiving themselves to be at risk of pregnancy; and not thinking about EC as an option. A third of respondents indicated they did not know how EC works, with several misconceptions about EC noted e. g., leading to infertility, similar to abortion. Seventy-nine percent of women agreed that EC is a responsible choice to prevent unwanted pregnancy, but nearly a third of women who used EC felt uncomfortable or judged when obtaining it. Conclusions EC is underutilised by three-quarters of the women surveyed. Women do not recognise they may be at risk of pregnancy when contraception fails. There are still several misbeliefs about EC indicating a need for better education of the public.",124
"Whereas some data are available about late smoking relapse among adult quitters, there are none for teen quitters. This study is a 6-year follow-up of teen quitters (n = 253) for whom we collected (retrospectively) data on the extent and timing of relapse. We found that even after a strictly defined quit (six-months prolonged abstinence) at one year, substantial relapse occurred both early and late: the majority (55%) of relapses occurred after the 0-1 year interval after having quit. These findings have implication for the need for research into the relapse process for teen quitters, and for the need to develop interventions for teens (as for adults) to prevent (early and) late relapse.

"The objective of the present research was to examine the association between lifetime cannabis use disorder (CUD), current suicidal ideation, and lifetime history of suicide attempts in a large and diverse sample of Iraq/Afghanistan-era veterans (N = 3233) using a battery of well-validated instruments. As expected, CUD was associated with both current suicidal ideation (OR = 1.683, p = 0.008) and lifetime suicide attempts (OR = 2.306, p < 0.0001), even after accounting for the effects of sex, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, alcohol use disorder, non-cannabis drug use disorder, history of childhood sexual abuse, and combat exposure. Thus, the findings from the present study suggest that CUD may be a unique predictor of suicide attempts among Iraq/Afghanistan-era veterans; however, a significant limitation of the present study was its cross-sectional design. Prospective research aimed at understanding the complex relationship between CUD, mental health problems, and suicidal behavior among veterans is clearly needed at the present time.

"The mean platelet volume (MPV), red cell distribution width (RDW) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) comprise laboratory markers in ankylosing spondylitis (AS). There is a controversy in the literature regarding which type of ear involvement is characteristic of AS. The aim of this study was to simultaneously investigate the MPV, RDW, platelet to lymphocyte (PLR) and NLR in patients with AS and their relationships with high-frequency hearing thresholds. Thirty patients with AS and 35 age-matched healthy subjects were included. Each subject was tested with low- (250, 500, 1000 and 2000 Hz) and high- (4000, 8000, 10,000, 12,000, 14,000 and 16,000 Hz) frequency audiometry. Additionally, the case and control groups were evaluated regarding the average hearing thresholds in bone conduction. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured. The RDW, MPV, neutrophils, lymphocytes and platelet counts were evaluated with the complete blood count. Furthermore, the NLR and PLR were calculated. The complete blood count, platelet numbers, ESR, CRP and NLR levels were significantly increased in the AS patients compared with the healthy controls (p < 0.001, p = 0.007, p0.05). The AS patients had increased average measurement values for the hearing threshold in both ears at frequencies of 250, 500, 1000 and 2000 Hz; however, there was no statistically significant difference (p >0.05). The average values of the hearing threshold in both ears at the high frequencies of 4000, 6000, 8000, 10,000, 12,000 and 14,000 Hz were significantly increased in the case group; however, it was not significantly increased at 16,000 Hz. The current study is the first to investigate the PLR, NLR, MPV and RDW levels in acute AS. We identified a significantly increased NLR, leukocyte count, ESR and CRP in AS patients. Sensorineural hearing loss, especially at extended high frequencies, is common in patients with AS and may represent an extra-articular feature of the disease. The combined use of NLR with the leukocyte count and other clinical assessments may facilitate the diagnostic process of ankylosing spondylitis.",107
"In order to study high and low cycle fatigue experiment bench control technology of a certain type of aircraft engine fan blade, we can reach the purpose of reducing the pressure pulsation of system and improving the stability of the test loading force. By means of simulation, we first designed the experiment bench model of high-low cycle fatigue based on MATLAB/SimHydraulics. Then on the basis of the system model, we completed the simulation according to the following steps: changing the position and loading ways of the accumulator in the hydraulic test bench; matching the system with different parameters. From the study can we find that the simulation of high-low cycle fatigue test rig has reached the expected purpose. At the same time, we got the effective parameter selection. In the process of simulation, we also found that the introduction of the accumulator can give great buffer effect to pressure pulsation which produced by the sudden closing of valves. At the mean time, the accumulator can bring more stable loading force. In conclusion, this study can provide necessary guidance to the design and production of experiment bench, so that we can get better experiment results.",85

"The efficacy of pulmonary vein antral isolation for patients with prolonged sinus pauses (PSP) on termination of atrial fibrillation has been reported. We studied the right atrial (RA) electrophysiologic and electroanatomic characteristics in such patients. Forty patients underwent electroanatomic mapping of the RA: 13 had PSP (group A), 13 had no PSP (group B), and 14 had paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (control group C). Group A had longer P-wave durations in lead II than did groups B and C (115.5 +/- 15.4 vs 99.5 +/- 10.9 vs 96.5 +/- 10.4 ms; P=0.001), and RA activation times (106.8 +/- 13.8 vs 99 +/- 8.7 vs 94.5 +/- 9.1 s; P=0.02). Group A's PP intervals were longer during adenosine triphosphate testing before ablation (4.6 +/- 2.3 vs 1.7 +/- 0.6 vs 1.5 +/- 1 s; P < 0.001) and after ablation (4.7 +/- 2.5 vs 2.2 +/- 1.4 vs 1.6 +/- 0.8 s; P < 0.001), and group A had more complex electrograms (11.4% +/- 5.4% vs 9.3% +/- 1.6% vs 5.8% +/- 1.6%; P < 0.001). Compared with group C, group A had significantly longer corrected sinus node recovery times at a 400-ms pacing cycle length after ablation, larger RA volumes (100.1 +/- 23.1 vs 83 +/- 22.1 mL; P=0.04), and lower conduction velocities in the high posterior (0.87 +/- 0.13 vs 1.02 +/- 0.21 mm/ms; P=0.02) and high lateral RA (0.89 +/- 0.2 vs 1.1 +/- 0.35 mm/ms; P=0.04). We found that patients with PSP upon termination of atrial fibrillation have RA electrophysiologic and electroanatomic abnormalities that warrant post-ablation monitoring.",111
"People readily make personality attributions to images of strangers' faces. Here we investigated the basis of these personality attributions as made to everyday, naturalistic face images. In a first study, we used 1000 highly varying ""ambient image"" face photographs to test the correspondence between personality judgments of the Big Five and dimensions known to underlie a range of facial first impressions: approachability, dominance, and youthful-attractiveness. Interestingly, the facial Big Five judgments were found to separate to some extent: judgments of openness, extraversion, emotional stability, and agreeableness were mainly linked to facial first impressions of approachability, whereas conscientiousness judgments involved a combination of approachability and dominance. In a second study we used average face images to investigate which main cues are used by perceivers to make impressions of the Big Five, by extracting consistent cues to impressions from the large variation in the original images. When forming impressions of strangers from highly varying, naturalistic face photographs, perceivers mainly seem to rely on broad facial cues to approachability, such as smiling.",63
"Studies on women's experiences as correspondence or Internet brides that were conducted used survey instruments, interviews, and other tests created and normed on U.S. populations. This study specifically examined the experiences of Filipina women who have utilized an international dating agency or other venues to meet their husbands. It attempted to phenomenologically extract the essence of this population's experiences as correspondence or Internet brides. Phenomenological analysis was conducted on the experiences of seven Filipina correspondence or Internet brides. Forty-four categories were determined and collapsed into eight broad themes: connection with the Filipino culture while acculturating to U.S. culture, negotiating the self, importance of family, correspondence experiences, connecting with her husband, resilience, betrayal, and the importance of one's socioeconomic status. The women's experiences were comparable with the previous literature, including the dichotomy with gender roles, the need to maintain harmony in their marital relationships, and maintaining a sense of independence.",77
"Nature-based approaches to flood risk management are increasing in popularity. Evidence for the effectiveness at the catchment scale of such spatially distributed upstream measures is inconclusive. However, it also remains an open question whether, under certain conditions, the individual impacts of a collection of flood mitigation interventions could combine to produce a detrimental effect on runoff response. A modelling framework is presented for evaluation of the impacts of hillslope and in-channel natural flood management interventions. It couples an existing semidistributed hydrological model with a new, spatially explicit, hydraulic channel network routing model. The model is applied to assess a potential flood mitigation scheme in an agricultural catchment in North Yorkshire, United Kingdom, comprising various configurations of a single variety of in-channel feature. The hydrological model is used to generate subsurface and surface fluxes for a flood event in 2012. The network routing model is then applied to evaluate the response to the addition of up to 59 features. Additional channel and floodplain storage of approximately 70,000m(3) is seen with a reduction of around 11% in peak discharge. Although this might be sufficient to reduce flooding in moderate events, it is inadequate to prevent flooding in the double-peaked storm of the magnitude that caused damage within the catchment in 2012. Some strategies using features specific to this catchment are suggested in order to improve the attenuation that could be achieved by applying a nature-based approach.",83
"Introduction: Posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTS) are associated with increased risk of obstetric complications among pregnant survivors of trauma, abuse and interpersonal violence, but little is known about how PTS affects women's actual experiences of obstetric care. This study investigated the rate at which abuse history was detected by obstetricians, whether abuse survivors experienced more invasive exams than is typically indicated for routine obstetric care, and whether psychological distress was associated with abuse survivors' sense of self-efficacy when communicating their obstetric care needs.Methods: Forty-one pregnant abuse survivors completed questionnaires about abuse history, current psychological distress and self-efficacy for communicating obstetric care needs and preferences. Electronic medical records (EMRs) were reviewed to examine frequency of invasive prenatal obstetric procedures (e.g. removal of clothing for external genital examination, pelvic exams and procedures) and to examine the detection rate of abuse histories during the initial obstetric visit.Results: The majority of participants (83%) reported at least one past incident of violent physical or sexual assault. Obstetricians detected abuse histories in less than one quarter of cases. Nearly half of participants (46%) received invasive exams for non-routine reasons. PTS and depression symptoms were associated with lower self-efficacy in communicating obstetric care preferences.Discussion: Women most at risk for experiencing distress during their obstetric visits and/or undergoing potentially distressing procedures may also be the least likely to communicate their distress to obstetricians. Results are discussed with implications for improving screening for abuse screening and distress symptoms as well as need for trauma-sensitive obstetric practices.",69
"Tendons that connect muscles to bone are often the targets of sports injuries. The currently unsatisfactory state of tendon repair is largely attributable to the limited understanding of basic tendon biology. A number of tendon lineage-related transcription factors have recently been uncovered and provide clues for the better understanding of tendon development. Scleraxis and Mohawk have been identified as critical transcription factors in tendon development and differentiation. Other transcription factors, such as Sox9 and Egr1/2, have also been recently reported to be involved in tendon development. However, the molecular mechanisms and application of these transcription factors remain largely unclear and this prohibits their use in tendon therapy. Here, we systematically review and analyze recent findings and our own data concerning tendon transcription factors and tendon regeneration. Based on these findings, we provide interaction and temporal programming maps of transcription factors, as a basis for future tendon therapy. Finally, we discuss future directions for tendon regeneration with differentiation and trans-differentiation approaches based on transcription factors.",27
"Daclatasvir (DCV) is a potent, pangenotypic, hepatitis C virus (HCV) non-structural protein 5A inhibitor with low potential for drug interactions with antiretroviral therapy (ART). We evaluated the safety and efficacy of DCV plus peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin (PegIFN/RBV) in HIV-1/HCV genotype-1-coinfected patients. AI444043 (NCT01471574), an open-label, Phase III, single-arm, response-guided treatment (RGT) study included 301 patients. They received DCV doses of 30, 60 or 90 mg once daily (depending on concomitant ART), plus weight-based RBV (< 75 kg, 1000 mg/day; or ae75 kg, 1200 mg/day), and once-weekly PegIFN 180 mu g, for 24 weeks. If required by RGT, PegIFN/RBV without DCV was extended for an additional 24 weeks of therapy. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with sustained virologic response at post-treatment Week 12 (SVR12). Overall, 224 (74%) patients achieved SVR12 and the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval was higher than the historic SVR rate with PegIFN/RBV alone (70 vs. 29%). Most common adverse events (AEs) were fatigue, neutropenia, anemia, asthenia and headache. On-treatment serious AEs occurred in 24/301 (8%) patients; 18/301 (6%) discontinued treatment due to AE. DCV + PegIFN/RBV led to sustained HCV virologic response in the majority of HIV-1-HCV-coinfected patients, regardless of concomitant ART. HIV control was not compromised and no new safety signals were identified. This study supports DCV use in HIV-1-HCV-coinfected patients, while allowing the vast majority of patients to remain on their existing ART regimen.",127
"Background: Much research does not address the practical needs of stakeholders responsible for introducing health care delivery interventions into organizations working to achieve better outcomes. In this article, we present an approach to using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to guide systematic research that supports rapid-cycle evaluation of the implementation of health care delivery interventions and produces actionable evaluation findings intended to improve implementation in a timely manner. Methods: To present our approach, we describe a formative cross-case qualitative investigation of 21 primary care practices participating in the Comprehensive Primary Care (CPC) initiative, a multi-payer supported primary care practice transformation intervention led by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Qualitative data include observational field notes and semi-structured interviews with primary care practice leadership, clinicians, and administrative and medical support staff. We use intervention-specific codes, and CFIR constructs to reduce and organize the data to support cross-case analysis of patterns of barriers and facilitators relating to different CPC components. Results: Using the CFIR to guide data collection, coding, analysis, and reporting of findings supported a systematic, comprehensive, and timely understanding of barriers and facilitators to practice transformation. Our approach to using the CFIR produced actionable findings for improving implementation effectiveness during this initiative and for identifying improvements to implementation strategies for future practice transformation efforts. Conclusions: The CFIR is a useful tool for guiding rapid-cycle evaluation of the implementation of practice transformation initiatives. Using the approach described here, we systematically identified where adjustments and refinements to the intervention could be made in the second year of the 4-year intervention. We think the approach we describe has broad application and encourage others to use the CFIR, along with intervention-specific codes, to guide the efficient and rigorous analysis of rich qualitative data.",8
"Electric machines are a key component of electric/hybrid electric vehicle (EV/HEV) powertrains. Thus, computationally efficient models for electric machines are essential for powertrain-level design, simulation, and optimization. In this paper, a finite-element-based method for quickly generating torque-speed curves and efficiency maps for electric machines is presented. First, magnetostatic finite-element analysis (FEA) is conducted on a "" base"" machine design. This analysis produces torque, normalized losses, flux linkage, and the maximum magnetic field intensity in the permanent magnets for a wide range of currentmagnitudes and phase angles. These values are then scaled based upon changing the size of the machine and the effective number of turns of the machine windings to quickly generate a variety of new machine designs and their corresponding efficiency maps using postprocessing techniques. Results suggest that, by avoiding resolving the FEA for the scaled designs, the proposed techniques can be used to quickly generate efficiency maps, and thus are useful for EV/HEV powertrain-level simulation and optimization.",85
"Following thyroid surgery, levothyroxine therapy is used to replace deficient thyroid hormones and prevent postoperative thyroid hypofunction. We compared the effects of replacement therapy with either liquid or tablet formulation of levothyroxine on mood states, self-perceived mental well-being and thyroid hormone profile in recently thyroidectomized patients. Profile of mood states, General Heath Questionnaire 12-items and thyroid hormone profile were assessed in recently (5-7 days) thyroidectomized patients at baseline and 2 months after randomization to replacement therapy with either liquid (n = 77) or tablet (n = 78) formulation of levothyroxine. After 2 months under levothyroxine replacement treatment, significant improvements of Positive Affect Scale (p < 0.001) and Negative Affect Scale (p < 0.001) of Profile of mood states, as well as of General Heath Questionnaire 12-items (p < 0.001) were observed in the study population. However, there were greater variations observed in patients assigned to liquid levothyroxine formulation in comparison to those who were assigned to levothyroxine in the form of tablet (time x treatment interaction: Positive Affect Scale of Profile of mood states, p = 0.030; Negative Affect Scale of Profile of mood states, p < 0.0001; General Heath Questionnaire 12-items, p = 0.003). As expected, circulating TSH levels significantly decreased (p < 0.001) while FT3 and FT4 levels significantly increased (p < 0.0001 for both) under levothyroxine replacement therapy. These changes were significantly greater in patients treated with liquid levothyroxine formulation (time x treatment interaction: TSH, p = 0.011; FT3, p = 0.016; FT4, p = 0.028). Our data indicate a greater efficacy of liquid formulation of levothyroxine in ameliorating mood states and self-perception of mental well-being and thyroid hormone profile after 2 months of replacement therapy in recently thyroidectomized patients.",133
This report deals with the loading of the geomembrane during the construction phase of the inner shell of a tunnel. In a systematic parameter analysis at the institute for underground construction at FH Munster the geomembrane and the geotextile were tested under different realistic conditions. Laboratory testing showed a dependence on the seal support surface of the shotcrete and on the characteristics of the geotextile. The deformations of the membranes due to fresh concrete pressure are significantly smaller than the permitted values in the technical regulations. The main results of the investigations are described below.,93
"International estimates of the incidence of non-accidental burns (NAB) in children admitted to burn centres vary from 1% to 25%. Hardly any data about Dutch figures exist. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence, treatment and outcome of burns due to suspected child abuse in paediatric burns. We described the process of care and outcome, including the accuracy of the SPUTOVAMO screening tool and examined child, burn and treatment characteristics related to suspicions of child abuse or neglect. A retrospective study was conducted in children aged 0-17 years with a primary admission after burn injuries to the burn centre Rotterdam in the period 2009-2013. Data on patient, injury and treatment characteristics were collected, using the Dutch Burn Repository R3. In addition, medical records were reviewed. In 498 paediatric admissions, suspected child abuse or neglect was present in 43 children (9%). 442 screening questionnaires (89%) were completed. In 52 out of 442 questionnaires (12%) the completed SPUTOVAMO had one or more positive signs. Significant independent predictors for suspected child abuse were burns in the genital area or buttocks (OR = 3.29; CI: 143-7.55) and a low socio-economic status (OR = 2.52; 95%CI: 1.30-4.90). The incidence of suspected child abuse indicating generation of additional support in our population is comparable to studies with a similar design in other countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.

"When Abusive Head Trauma (AHT) is suspected in a child, a dilated eye examination by an ophthalmologist is an essential part of the medical workup, as the presence and pattern of retinal hemorrhages can have a high positive predictive rate for abusive head injury. This article proposes to review the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, natural history, sequelae, and differential diagnosis of retinal hemorrhages and other ocular lesions associated with AHT.",76
"Objective: To propose a phylogenetic significance to the Moro reflex which remains unexplained since its publication in 1918 because both hands are free at the end of the gesture. Method: Among the 75 videos of healthy term newborns we have filmed in a research project on antenatal education to parenthood, we describe a sequence that clearly showed the successive movements of the Moro reflex and we report the occurrence of this reflex in the videos that were recorded from Time 0 of birth defined as the moment that lies between the birth of the thorax and the pelvis of the infant. Results: The selected sequence showed the following succession of the newborn's actions: quick extension-adduction of both arms, the orientation of the body, head and eyes towards a human person, and full extension-abduction of both arms with spreading of the fingers, crying and a distressed face. There were 13 Moro reflexes between 2 and 14s from Time 0 of birth. We found a significant association between the occurrence of the Moro reflex and the placement of the newborn at birth in supine position on the mother's abdomen (p = 0.002). Discussion: The quick extension-adduction of both arms which started the sequence may be considered as a startle reflex controlled by the neural fear system and the arm extension adduction which followed as a Moro reflex. The characteristics of all Moro reflexes were those of ritualization: amplitude, duration, stereotype of the gestures. This evolutionary process turns a physiological behavior, grasping in this case, to a non-verbal communicative behavior whose meaning is a request to be picked up in the arms. The gestures associated with the Moro reflex: crying and orientation of the body, head, and eyes towards a human person, are gestures of intention to communicate which support our hypothesis. The neural mechanism of the Moro reaction probably involves both the fear and the separation-distress systems. Conclusion: This paper proposes for the first time a phylogenetic significance to the Moro reflex: a ritualized behavior of nonverbal communication. Professionals should avoid stimulating the newborns' fear system by unnecessarily triggering Moro reflexes. Antenatal education should teach parents to respond to the Moro reflexes of their newborn infant by picking her up in their arms with mother talk. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",64
"Muscle injuries frequently occur during sport and are one of the commonest injuries. The diagnosis and treatment of muscle injuries impose high demands on medical treatment, in order to ensure successful regeneration and a rapid return to sport. Most of the injuries can be treated conservatively, as skeletal muscles have a high endogenous capacity for repair and regeneration. Conservative treatment includes initial on-field therapy. This is known as the RICE principle and is common and recommended for initial treatment for most sports injuries. The primary therapy target is to reduce pain, swelling and bleeding and thus to limit the initial inflammatory process and prevent further damage. During the first days after injury, brief immobilization helps to reduce the re-injury rate and accelerates the formation of granulation tissue. There are many possible additional treatments, including intramuscular injections, manipulation of the sacroiliac joint or rehabilitation programs, including stretching and strengthening. If the acute treatment phase is complete after 3 to 5 days, more active treatment, including trunk stabilisation, stretching and strengthening, can be started gradually. Despite their high prevalence, there have only been a few studies on the treatment and management of these injuries. The aim of this manuscript is to review the literature on the classification, pathobiology and treatment strategies for muscle injuries.",27
"This paper presents a technique for reducing the input current ripple on multiphase power converters that provide multiple heterogeneous power supply rails, such as those present in portable electronics and computers. Through asymmetric interleaving of individual phases, the input current ripple can be reduced compared to conventional interleaving. The technique is derived based on an analytic description of the relevant current waveforms. Practical requirements of a digital control implementation of the proposed technique are analyzed, and its possible performance improvement is quantified through simulations and experimental results. With the proposed technique, close to a 3x reduction in input current ripple, compared to conventional methods, is demonstrated using an experimental prototype comprising a microcontroller that controls a multiphase 180 nm CMOS power management IC.",48
"The current study focused on how dihydrotestosterone (DHT) regulates synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus of mild cognitive impairment male senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice. Five-month-old SAMP8 mice were divided into the control, castrated and castrated-DHT groups, in which the mice were castrated and treated with physiological doses of DHT for a period of 2 months. To determine the regulatory mechanisms of DHT in the cognitive capacity, the effects of DHT on the morphology of the synapse and the expression of synaptic marker proteins in the hippocampus were investigated using immunohistochemistry, qPCR and western blot analysis. The results showed that the expression of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), synaptophysin (SYN) and developmentally regulated brain protein (Drebrin) was reduced in the castrated group compared to the control group. However, DHT promoted the expression of CREB, PSD95, SYN and Drebrin in the hippocampus of the castrated-DHT group. Thus, androgen depletion impaired the synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus of SAMP8 and accelerated the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like neuropathology, suggesting that a similar mechanism may underlie the increased risk for AD in men with low testosterone. In addition, DHT regulated synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) SAMP8 mice and delayed the progression of disease to Alzheimer's dementia. In conclusion, androgen-based hormone therapy is a potentially useful strategy for preventing the progression of MCI in aging men. Androgens enhance synaptic markers (SYN, PSD95, and Drebrin), activate CREB, modulate the fundamental biology of synaptic structure, and lead to the structural changes of plasticity in the hippocampus, all of which result in improved cognitive function.",6
"The electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding of reduced graphene oxide (MRG), B-doped MRG (BMRG), N-doped MRG (N-MRG), and B-N co-doped MRG (B-N-MRG) have been studied in the Ku-band frequency range (12.8-18 GHz). We have developed a green, fast, and cost-effective microwave assisted route for synthesis of doped MRG. B-N-MRG shows high electrical conductivity in comparison to MRG, B-MRG and N-MRG, which results better electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding ability. The co-doping of B and N significantly enhances the electrical conductivity of MRG from 21.4 to 124.4 Sm-1 because N introduces electrons and B provides holes in the system and may form a nanojunction inside the material. Their temperature-dependent electrical conductivity follows 2D-variable range hopping (2D-VRH) and Efros-Shldovskii-VRH (ES-VRH) conduction model in a low temperature range (T < 50 K). The spatial configuration of MRG after doping of B and N enhances the space charge polarization, natural resonance, dielectric polarization, and trapping of EM waves by internal reflection leading to a high EMI shielding of -42 dB (-99.99% attenuation) compared to undoped MR.G (-28 dB) at a critical thickness of 1.2 mm. Results suggest that the B-N-MRG has great potential as a candidate for a new type of EMI shielding material useful in aircraft, defense industries, communication systems, and stealth technology.",98
"Plasma stealth technology has many unique advantages, hence it has a promising application in the aviation and aerospace fields. The attenuation characteristics of vertical incidence of electromagnetic waves into unmagnetized plasmas with metal underlay are studied theoretically and experimentally in this paper. Regulations for the change of electromagnetic wave attenuation with plasma parameters are analyzed in theory using WKB method. A-large-area plasma slab is generated stably by inductively coupled discharge, and the reflectivity arch test system of plasma slab is set up. While the attenuation effects of electromagnetic wave in unmagnetized plasmas are studied experimentally. The electron density of plasma generated at different discharge powers is obtained by using the microwave phase and plasma spectrum diagnostic technique, ranging from 8.17 x 10(-9) to 7.61 x 10(10) cm(-3). The plasma generated by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) has an effect on the attenuation of electromagnetic waves, and the experimental results accord well with the theoretical ones. Results show that increasing the plasma electron density and covering homogeneity can contribute to improving the attenuation effect of plasma on electromagnetic waves.",98
"Little is known about the mechanisms of smartphone features that are used in sealing relationships between psychopathology and problematic smartphone use. Our purpose was to investigate two specific smartphone usage types process use and social use for associations with depression and anxiety; and in accounting for relationships between anxiety/depression and problematic smartphone use. Social smartphone usage involves social feature engagement (e.g., social networking, messaging), while process usage involves non-social feature engagement (e.g., news consumption, entertainment, relaxation). 308 participants from Amazon's Mechanical Turk intemet labor market answered questionnaires about their depression and anxiety symptoms, and problematic smartphone use along with process and social smartphone use dimensions. Statistically adjusting for age and sex, we discovered the association between anxiety symptoms was stronger with process versus social smartphone use. Depression symptom severity was negatively associated with greater social smartphone use. Process smartphone use was more strongly associated with problematic smartphone use. Finally, process smartphone use accounted for relationships between anxiety severity and problematic smartphone use. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",104
"Chronic stressors are generally considered to disrupt reproduction and inhibit mating. Here we test the hypothesis that a chronic stressor, specifically social isolation, can facilitate adaptive changes that enhance/accelerate reproductive effort. In general, monogamous species display high levels of prosociality, delayed sexual maturation, and greater parental investment in fewer, higher quality offspring compared with closely related polygynous species. We predicted that chronic social isolation would promote behavioral and neurochemical patterns in prairie voles associated with polygyny. Male and female prairie voles were isolated for four weeks and changes in mating behavior, alloparental care, estrogen receptor (ER) a expression and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in brain regions regulating sociosexual behavior were examined. In males, isolation accelerated copulation, increased ER alpha in the medial amygdala (MEApd) and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTpm), and reduced TH expression in the MEApd and BSTpm, but had no effect on alloparental behavior. In females, isolation resulted in more rapid estrus induction and reduced TH expression in the MEApd and BSTpm, but had no effect on estradiol sensitivity or ERa expression. The results support the hypothesis that ERa expression in the MEApd and BSTpm is a critical determinant of male copulatory behavior and/or mating system. The lack of change in alloparental behavior suggests that changes in prosocial behavior are selective and regulated by different mechanisms. The results also suggest that TH in the MEApd and BSTpm may play a critical role in determining mating behavior in both sexes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",65
"A critical aspect of applying modern computational solution methods to complex multi-physics systems of relevance to nuclear reactor modeling, is the assessment of the predictive capability of specific proposed mathematical models. In this respect the understanding of numerical error, the sensitivity of the solution to parameters associated with input data, boundary condition uncertainty, and mathematical models is critical. Additionally, the ability to evaluate and or approximate the model efficiently, to allow development of a reasonable level of statistical diagnostics of the mathematical model and the physical system, is of central importance. In this study we report on initial efforts to apply integrated adjoint-based computational analysis and automatic differentiation tools to begin to address these issues. The study is carried out in the context of a Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes approximation to turbulent fluid flow and heat transfer using a particular spatial discretization based on implicit fully-coupled stabilized FE methods. Initial results are presented that show the promise of these computational techniques in the context of nuclear reactor relevant prototype thermal-hydraulics problems. Published by Elsevier Inc.",83
"Background: Headaches associated with pituitary adenoma have been reported to be related to the structural characteristics and endocrine factors of the tumour itself. Objectives: The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence and clinical characteristics of, and the risk factors for, non-functioning pituitary adenoma (NFPA)-associated headaches in Chinese patients with normal endocrine activity. Methods: Ninety-seven patients with a NFPA with normal endocrine laboratory results were prospectively enrolled in this study. The relevant clinical demographic data were collected and examined with the appropriate statistical methods. Results: The pre-operative prevalence of tumour-associated headaches was 48.5%; 87.2% of these patients had migraine-like headaches. A family history of primary headache (odds ratio (OR) 3.67; p=0.032) and a higher tumour Knosp grade (OR 1.83; p=0.001) were identified as risk factors for the occurrence of NFPA-associated headaches. The patient's age, sex, visual disturbances, optic chiasm compression, tumour size and tumour volume were not significantly associated with NFPA-associated headaches (p>0.05). In addition, headache severity was significantly correlated with the Knosp grade (r=0.339; p=0.001). The sides of the headaches and of cavernous sinus invasion were significantly concordant (48.9% agreement; kappa=0.257; p=0.007). Conclusions: Migraine-like headaches are a common clinical manifestation in patients with NFPAs. A family history of primary headaches and cavernous sinus invasion are risk factors for NFPA-associated headaches.",127
"By exchanging information directly between non-adjacent protocol layers, cross-layer (CL) interaction can significantly improve and optimize network performances such as energy efficiency and delay. This is particularly important for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) where sensor devices are energy-constrained and deployed for real-time monitoring applications. Existing CL schemes mainly exploit information exchange between physical, medium access control (MAC), and routing layers, with only a handful involving application layer. For the first time, we proposed a framework for CL optimization based on user context of ambient intelligence (AmI) application and an ontology-based context modeling and reasoning mechanism. We applied the proposed framework to jointly optimize MAC and network (NET) layer protocols for WSNs. Extensive evaluations show that the resulting optimization through context awareness and CL interaction for both MAC and NET layer protocols can yield substantial improvements in terms of throughput, packet delivery, delay, and energy performances.",92
"Our previous research showed that vertical vection could modulate human mood. We further examined this possibility by using memory recognition task of positive, negative and neutral emotional images with high and low arousal levels. Those images were remembered accidentally while the participants did visual dummy task, and later presented together with novel images during vertical vection-inducing or neutral visual stimuli. The results showed that downward vection facilitated the recognition of negative images and inhibited the recognition of positive ones. These modulations of incidental memory task provide an additional evidence for vection influence on cognitive and emotional processing, and also provide a new paradigm that can be used in future vection and embodied cognition research.",78
"Defect detection and classification of ceramic tile surface defects occurred in firing units are usually performed by human observations in most factories. In this paper, an automatic image processing system with high accuracy and time efficient approaches is presented. To this end, first, for defect detection, Rotation Invariant Measure of Local Variance (RIMLV) operator from statistical methods is employed for defect edges detection, and cooperatively a Close morphological operator from structural methods is used to fill and smooth detected regions. Then, all the detected defects of one ceramic tile are labeled, and the corresponding geometric features are extracted. Finally, a multi-class support vector machine classifier with winner-takes-all strategy based on statistical pattern recognition theories is employed to identify the defect type.",90
"Purpose: This study discusses the process of co-constructing a prototype pedagogical model for working with youth from socially vulnerable backgrounds.Participants and settings: This six-month activist research project was conducted in a soccer program in a socially vulnerable area of Brazil in 2013. The study included 17 youths, 4 coaches, a pedagogic coordinator and a social worker. An expert in student-centered pedagogy and inquiry-based activism assisted as a debriefer helping in the progressive data analysis and the planning of the work sessions.Data collection/analysis: Multiple sources of data were collected, including 38 field journal/observation and audio records of: 18 youth work sessions, 16 coaches' work sessions, 3 combined coaches and youth work sessions, and 37 meetings between the researcher and the expert.Findings: The process of co-construction of this prototype pedagogical model was divided into three phases. The first phase involved the youth and coaches identifying barriers to sport opportunities in their community. In the second phase, the youth, coaches and researchers imagined alternative possibilities to the barriers identified. In the final phase, we worked collaboratively to create realistic opportunities for the youth to begin to negotiate some of the barriers they identified. In this phase, the coaches and youth designed an action plan to implement (involving a Leadership Program) aimed at addressing the youths' needs in the sport program. Five critical elements of a prototype pedagogical model were co-created through the first two processes and four learning aspirations emerged in the last phase of the project.Implications: We suggest an activist approach of co-creating a pedagogical model of sport for working with youth from socially vulnerable backgrounds is beneficial. That is, creating opportunities for youth to learn to name, critique and negotiate barriers to their engagement in sport in order to create empowering possibilities.",66
"Production of hybrid seeds and pursuing heterosis breeding of many crops have been accomplished using male sterile lines. However, not all crops have valuable male sterile lines due to instability of male sterility and absence of a restorer system. In this study, male sterile lines have been induced using a two-component system. The extracellular ribonuclease Barnase was cleaves into two inactive yet complementary fragments, designated as 'Bn-5' and 'Bn-3'. Both components were controlled by a TA29 promoter. They were transferred into the tomato inbred line 'Yellow tomato' by Agrobacterium method. Southern blotting identified that 11 transgenic Bn-5 plants (T-0) and 10 transgenic Bn-3 plants (T-0) were obtained. The vegetative phenotypes of all T-0 plants were similar to wild-type, and they were capable of producing viable pollen grains and normal fruit with seeds, indicating that Barnase had lost its function after it being split two partial fragments. After self-pollination, homozygous progenies (T-1) of transgenic Bn-5 and Bn-3 plants were chosen to cross each other, Barnase could be reconstituted and co-expressed in the same cell, which caused the hybrid plants to produce collapsed pollen grains with no viability and thus100 % male sterile plants were obtained. Stamens of male sterile plants were shorter than those of the wild type plants. PCR detection demonstrated that all male sterile plants contained Barnase, but male fertile plants did not. The male sterile plants were crossed with the male fertile inbred lines, and the result showed that hybrid (F-1) plants were capable of producing normal fruit with seeds, and their pollen grain fertility was restored. The co-segregation ratio of Bn-5 and Bn-3 fragments showed 1:1 among hybrid plants. In conclusion, the results verified that the male sterility could be generated by two component system and be used in hybrid seed production. The F-1 between the male sterile plant and the inbred line showed heterotic comparing to both parents. This system needs not breed restoration line.",39
"There is an unmet need for herbal medicine identification using a fast, sensitive, and easy-to-use method that does not require complex infrastructure and well-trained technicians. For instance, the detection of adulterants in Lobelia chinensis herbal product has been challenging, since current detection technologies are not effective due to their own limits. High Resolution Melting (HRM) has emerged as a powerful new technology for clinical diagnosis, research in the food industry and in plant molecular biology, and this method has already highlighted the complexity of species identification. In this study, we developed a method of species specific detection of L. chinensis using HRM analysis combined with internal transcribed spacer 2. We then applied this method to commercial products purporting to contain L. chinensis. Our results demonstrated that HRM can differentiate L. chinensis from six common adulterants. HRM was proven to be a fast and accurate technique for testing the authenticity of L. chinensis in herbal products. Based on these results, a HRM approach for herbal authentication is provided .",30
"Depression is a common and often harmful disorder, which is frequently associated with the winter season. Research has shown a link between type 2 diabetes mellitus and depression. Furthermore, diabetics with depression have a higher rate of adverse outcomes. Little has been published regarding the seasonality of depression in diabetics.

"This study describes a set of real-time interactive experiments that address system identification and model reference adaptive control (MRAC) techniques. In constructing laboratory experiments that contribute to efficient teaching, experimental design and instructional strategy are crucial, but a process for doing this has yet to be defined. This paper is an attempt towards filling this gap. Its contributions are: 1) to describe a sample set of experiments for both senior undergraduate-and graduate-level students, to strengthen their understanding of system identification and control; 2) to help instructors wishing to set up a laboratory with an interactive learning strategy; and 3) to propose a set of assessment criteria for engineering accreditation in system identification and control laboratories. A benefit of this paper for engineering educators is that it provides a roadmap for transferring complex theory problems into prototypes in the laboratory. Furthermore, the instructional strategies proposed can easily be adapted to other engineering courses.",55
"Background and objectives: Body mass index (BMI) has been shown to be a more important predictor of bone mineral density (BMD). The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship of anthropometric measures including body mass index with bone mineral density in postmenopausal non-osteoporotic, osteopenic and osteoporotic women. Methods: In this cross sectional study postmenopausal females between 50-70 years of age were recruited and divided into three groups: non-osteoporotic (n= 52), osteopenic (n= 69) and osteoporotic females (n= 47). Anthropometric measures and bone mineral density were assessed. ANOVA was applied to compare groups while Post hoc Tuckey's test was used formultiple comparisons between the groups. Spearman's rho correlation was used to establish correlations. Results: Body mass index (p = 0.034) and hip circumference (p = 0.013) were significantly higher in osteopenic as compared to osteoporotic females and waist to hip ratio was significantly higher (p = 0.005) in osteoporotic as compared to non-osteoporotic females. Significant positive correlation of body mass index was found with T-score (p = 0.022) and ultrasound bone profile index (p< 0.001) in postmenopausal females. Conclusion: High body mass index is associated with high bone mineral density and reduced fracture risk in postmenopausal females. Increasing age and high waist to hip ratio can also lead to reduced bone mineral density in postmenopausal females.",16
"Nowadays, considerable attention is paid to agile methods as a means to improve management of software development processes. The widespread use of such methods in professional contexts has encouraged their integration into software engineering training and undergraduate courses. Although several research efforts have focused on teaching Scrum through simulating a software development project, they covered only the learning of programming practices within a Scrum team. Furthermore, few studies tackle nontechnical skills other than the development practices themselves. The work presented here introduces an original Scrum-based training model enhanced with agile coaching to maximize student performance. This was validated by a case study on a capstone project in a Scrum course. This paper summarizes the positive results of introducing agile coaching, which resulted in approximately 22% more coverage of software engineering practices. In addition, a survey data showed that, compared to students who did not receive coaching, coached students gained valuable insight into the internalization of Scrum, problem solving, and guidance by means of checkpoint meetings.",123
"Non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), obesity, cancer, pulmonary disease, and diabetes are a very high global health concern. The health costs of risk factors for CVD, such as hypertension (HTN), is mounting and are unrelenting. As an example, it is estimated that direct and indirect costs due to HTN amounted to $46.4 billion in 2011 and projections of six-fold increases by 2030; the importance of low-cost nonpharmacological interventions involving collaborative teams of health care professionals is at a critical junction. Certainly, the data supported by research including some clinical trials for healthy living interventions support deploying health education, nutrition, smoking cessation, and physical activity(PA) in preventing CVD risk, such as HTN. Exercise training (ET) for blood pressure (BP) control has been shown to be an effective and integral component of BP management. However, less is known about what optimization of PA/ET modalities with nutrition and lifestyle tracking with modern era technologies will bring to this equation. New research methods may need to consider how to collaborate to collect data in using teams of researchers while interacting with community centers, school systems, and in traditional health care practices. This review will discuss and present what is known about the research that support modern era healthy living medicine and how this data may be integrated in venues that support health lifestyle in the community (i.e. schools and the work place).

"In instances of widespread conflict and mass atrocities, socially prescribed and perpetuated gender roles often begin to dissolve alongside the rule of law and state institutions. Mass violence tears at the social fabric of the community and accepted norms of gendered behavior are suspended. Recent conflicts, including the genocide in Rwanda, have created a temporary space for the inclusion of women in previously restricted public spheres and capacities. Rwanda stands out as unique because these changes were not temporary. Following the end of the genocide, Rwanda's state organs, nongovernmental organizations, and community members did not close off these public spaces or advocate for the return of girls and women to pre-genocide gender structures and patriarchal practices. This paper will analyze Rwanda's gender mainstreaming and gender equality initiatives, identifying three influential factors, and make recommendations for the replication of Rwanda's success in other post-conflict countries.",77

"Purpose: The primary objective was to use isotemporal substitution models to estimate whether replacing time spent in sedentary video games (SVGs) and active outdoor play (AOP) with active video games (AVGs) would be associated with changes in youth's mental health. Methods: A representative sample of 20,122 Canadian youth in Grades 6-10 was studied. The exposure variables were average hours/day spent playing AVGs, SVGs, and AOP. The outcomes consisted of a negative and internalizing mental health indicator (emotional problems), a positive and internalizing mental health indicator (life satisfaction), and a positive and externalizing mental health indicator (prosocial behavior). Isotemporal substitution models estimated the extent to which replacing time spent in SVGs and AOP with an equivalent amount of time in AVGs had on the mental health indicators. Results: Replacing 1 hour/day of SVGs with 1 hour/day of AVGs was associated with a 6% (95% confidence interval: 3%-9%) reduced probability of high emotional problems, a 4% (2%-7%) increased probability of high life satisfaction, and a 13% (9%-16%) increased probability of high prosocial behavior. Replacing 1 hour/day of AOP with 1 hour/day of AVGs was associated with a 7% (3%-11%) increased probability of high emotional problems, a 3% (1%-5%) reduced probability of high life satisfaction, and a 6% (2%-9%) reduced probability of high prosocial behavior. Conclusions: Replacing SVGs with AVGs was associated with more preferable mental health indicators. Conversely, replacing AOP with AVGs was associated with more deleterious mental health indicators.

"Results of meta-analyses suggested subtle deficits in cognitive control among antisocial individuals. Because almost all studies focused on children with conduct problems or adult psychopaths, however, little is known about cognitive control mechanisms among the majority of persistent violent offenders who present an antisocial personality disorder(ASPD). The present study aimed to determine whether offenders with ASPD, relative to non-offenders, display dysfunction in the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive control and to assess the extent to which these dysfunctions are associated with psychopathic traits and trait impulsivity. Participants comprised 21 violent offenders and 23 non-offenders who underwent event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a non-verbal Stroop task. The offenders, relative to the non-offenders, exhibited reduced response time interference and a different pattern of conflict-and error-related activity in brain areas involved in cognitive control, attention, language, and emotion processing, that is, the anterior cingulate, dorsolateral prefrontal, superior temporal and postcentral cortices, putamen, thalamus, and amygdala. Moreover, between-group differences in behavioural and neural responses revealed associations with core features of psychopathy and attentional impulsivity. Thus, the results of the present study confirmed the hypothesis that offenders with ASPD display alterations in the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive control and that those alterations relate, at least inpart, to personality characteristics.

"Roofers have long suffered from low back disorders (LBDs), which are a primary nonfatal injury in construction. Ergonomic studies have identified several risk factors associated with LBDs in workplaces and developed biomechanical models for general LBD risk assessments. However, these models cannot be directly used for assessments in roof workplaces because they are designed for general tasks without considering roofers' posture variance and effects of working on slanted roof surfaces. This paper examined the relationship between roofing work-related factors and LBD risk among roofers using a laboratory assessment. A pitch-configurable wood platform was built to mimic the rooftop. The maximum trunk flexion angle and normalized electromyography (EMG) signals were measured as indicators using a motion capture system and a skeletal muscle signal recording system under different settings, i.e., different roof slopes, postures, facing directions, and working paces. The results indicated the measured factors with significant effects on the LBD development and revealed unfavorable conditions (e.g., using a stooped posture to work on low-pitch rooftops at a fast pace) where the work on rooftops needs particular attention. Such information is useful for systematic understanding of roofing nonfatal LBD developments among construction professionals and may enable development of interventions and guidelines for reducing the prevalence of LBDs at roofing jobsites.

"A system is presented for emulate a mouse from the movement of the head and eyelids. The position of the head is used for controlling the horizontal and vertical displacement of the cursor, and the closing of the eyelids to activate the click of the right and left buttons. The system includes zoom, navigation shortcuts, vertical scrollbars and menus activation according to the cursor position; that enhance the functionality and facilitate handling applications. The proposed solution eliminates the restriction of direct contact with the mouse, and empowers people with motor disabilities in the upper extremities to interact with the computer. The mouse emulator can also be used by people without limitations to expand command instructions. The system was tested in navigation on social network Facebook, where an average speed of 382 pixels / s was obtained, with an average accuracy of 22 pixels for the X axis and 17 pixels for the Y axis. However, after user interaction with the interface, improvements of 23% and 37% were observed, in execution time and location accuracy, respectively. Click activation by temporary location over a menu option had a performance of 100%; while the right and left clicks by eyelid closing had a performance of 93% and 92%, respectively. Finally, the surveys showed high satisfaction about the proposed interface during user interaction with Facebook.",0
"The present paper provides a dynamic, non-linear and fully coupled Finite Element (FE) formulation based on the Timoshenko beam theory to study elasto-thermoelectric responses in thermoelectric devices. The two main motivations of this work are: i) to study mechanical responses in thermoelectric devices, which must be taken into account in the design of Peltier cells due to the fragility and relative low strength of the semiconductors, and ii) to provide a numerical tool that decreases the CPU time to allow the introduction of designs based on optimization processes and on sensitivity analyses that could require many evaluations. In order to undertake the objectives of this work, the general three-dimensional governing equations are reduced to one-dimensional ones by means of several assumptions. Then, a set of five multi-coupled partial differential equations is obtained. The resultant expressions are thermodynamically consistent and form a multi-coupled monolithic FE formulation, differently to stagger formulations that require two separated steps to reach the final result. Numerically, this set of multi-coupled equations is discretized using the FE method and implemented into FEAP Taylor, 2010 [1]. For a proper validation of the code, four benchmarks are performed using one-dimensional dynamic analytical solutions developed by the authors. Finally, this formulation is compared with a three-dimensional FE formulation also developed by the authors in Pe' rez-Aparicio et al., 2015 [2] to model a commercial Peltier cell. This comparison reveals that: i) relative errors are lower than 13% and ii) CPU times decrease significantly, more than one order of magnitude. In conclusion, the beam thermoelectric formulation is an accurate model that reduces CPU time and could be used in future design of thermoelectric devices.",88
"In this paper, we presented a novel operational amplifier (op-amp) only with solution-processed n-type amorphous indium-gallium-zinc oxide (a-IGZO) thin-film transistors (TFTs). The a-IGZO TFTs and common-source amplifier were fabricated on glass substrate through the solution process and confirmed to show stable electrical characteristics suitable for display driving circuits. Based on the experimental results, we designed an op-amp to have an overall gain of 30.5 dB, a cut-off frequency of 1.47 kHz, and a unit gain frequency of 6.65 kHz when supply voltage was +/- 15 V. Finally, by constituting the comparator, the proposed op-amp is expected to be used in power control and driving systems for display applications.",60
"Recently, software quality issues have emerged to be recognized as a fundamental point as we actualize an extensive growth of organizations involved in software industries. Still, these organizations cannot ensure the quality of their products; therefore abandoning customers in uncertainties. Software certification is the branch of quality by means that quality requires to be measured prior to certification admitting process. However, creating an official certification model is difficult due to the deficiency of data in the domain of software engineering. This research participates in solving the problem of assessing software quality by introducing a model that handles a fuzzy inference engine to mix both of the processes-driven and application-driven quality assurance procedures. The fundamental purpose of the suggested model is to enhance the compactness and the interpretability of the system's fuzzy rules via engaging an ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO), which attempts to discover a good rule description by a set of compound rules initially represented with traditional single rules. The proposed model is a fitting one that can be seen as practicing certification models that have already been created from software quality domain data and modifying them to a context-specific data. The model has been tested by a case study and the results have confirmed feasibility and practicality of the model in a real environment. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.",123
"Hyperspectral remote sensing data carry information on the leaf area index (LAI) of forests, and thus in principle, LAI can be estimated based on the data by inverting a forest reflectance model. However, LAI is usually not the only unknown in a reflectance model; especially, the leaf spectral albedo and understory reflectance are also not known. If the uncertainties of these parameters are not accounted for, the inversion of a forest reflectance model can lead to biased estimates for LAI. In this paper, we study the effects of reflectance model uncertainties on LAI estimates, and further, investigate whether the LAI estimates could recover from these uncertainties with the aid of Bayesian inference. In the proposed approach, the unknown leaf albedo and understory reflectance are estimated simultaneously with LAI from hyperspectral remote sensing data. The feasibility of the approach is tested with numerical simulation studies. The results show that in the presence of unknown parameters, the Bayesian LAI estimates which account for the model uncertainties outperform the conventional estimates that are based on biased model parameters. Moreover, the results demonstrate that the Bayesian inference can also provide feasible measures for the uncertainty of the estimated LAI. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",94
"An algorithm of the wave method for structural health monitoring (SHM) is tested and calibrated using shake table experiment data of a full-scale, seven-story, reinforced-concrete building slice. The method is based on monitoring changes in the velocity of waves propagating vertically through the structure, identified by least-squares (LSQ) fit of beam models. The experiment was conducted by a team from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) on the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulations (NEES) outdoor shake table. Ambient noise, white noise, and earthquake response data for four progressive damage states were analyzed. The algorithm is tested for the first time on highly dispersive wave propagation, on a damaged structure, and on much shorter segments of ambient vibration data than used previously. The structure is modeled as a Timoshenko beam with large shear stiffness, and its compressional wave velocity, cL, is identified. The change in cL is measured for the different damage states and is compared with the change of the fundamental frequency of vibration, f1. The effectiveness of the method is discussed.

"Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a anti-inflammatory cytokine, which controls inflammation by inhibiting the synthesis of several cytokines produced by Th1 cells and macrophages. The association between Interleukin-10 promoter polymorphisms with the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS) remains inconclusive. In this study, a meta-analysis has been performed to assess the relationship between IL-10 gene polymorphisms rs1800896, rs1800871 and rs1800872 with the risk of MS. Nine case-control studies were selected involving 2755 participants. The association between the polymorphisms and MS was examined by the pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in allelic, homozygote, heterozygote, dominant and recessive genetic models. Of analyzed genetic models, the pooled ORs and CIs of each SNPs calculated based on random (I-2 >50) or fixed effects (I-20.05) of genetic predisposition with MS susceptibility across Asian and Caucasian populations. In addition, assessment based on funnel plot and Egger's linear regression test suggests no publication bias in all analyzed genetic models. Overall, our results demonstrated that rs1800896, rs1800871 and rs1800872 polymorphisms may not be the risk factor for the development of MS in both the populations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

"Phospholipase D (PLD) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) were implicated in apoptosis and cancer. However, direct evidence on the role of PLD in the cause of apoptosis remains obscure. It was recently reported that apoptosis and necrosis could be induced in the cerebellum and brainstem after focal cerebral hypoxic-ischemic (HI) injury. It was found that apoptosis could be enhanced by farnesol inhibition of PLD signal transduction. Whereas it was shown that highly invasive cancer cell line depends on PLD activity for survival when deprived of serum growth factors. Based on these reports, it is postulated that apoptosis in the cerebellum and brainstem induced after focal cerebral HI treatment may be caused by faulty PLD expression. This is consistent with a report that PLD1 activity and mRNA levels were down-regulated during apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, Northern blotting was used to examine PLD2 mRNA expression after focal cerebral HI. The results show that both PLD2 mRNA 10.8 and 3.9 kb transcripts were significantly decreased by as much as 37% in the brainstem and cerebellum areas 3 h after HI compared to the control, concur with previous report of decreasing PLD activity after ischemia. These PLD2 transcripts, however, were not significantly different from the control 3 days after HI, indicating that the decrease in PLD2 transcription after HI maybe a transient phenomenon. This is the first report to show that the loss of membrane integrity resulting from deprivation of energy and growth factors after HI could cause decrease in PLD2 transcription that promotes apoptosis. The hypothetic role of PLD2 and the mechanism leading to apoptosis remains to be further elucidated.",38
"Human biomonitoring (HBM) of dose and biochemical effect nowadays has tremendous utility providing an efficient and cost effective means of measuring human exposure to chemical substances. HBM considers all routes of uptake and all sources which are relevant making it an ideal instrument for risk assessment and risk management. HBM can identify new chemical exposures, trends and changes in exposure, establish distribution of exposure among the general population, identify vulnerable groups and populations with higher exposures and identify environmental risks at specific contaminated sites with relatively low expenditure. The sensitivity of HBM methods moreover enables the elucidation of human metabolism and toxic mechanisms of the pollutants. So, HBM is a tool for scientists as well as for policy makers. Blood and urine are by far the most approved matrices. HBM can be done for most chemical substances which are in the focus of the worldwide discussion of environmental medicine. This especially applies for metals, PAH, phthalates, dioxins, pesticides, as well as for aromatic amines, perfluorinated chemicals, environmental tobacco smoke and volatile organic compounds. Protein adducts, especially Hb-adducts, as surrogates of DNA adducts measuring exposure as well as biochemical effect very specifically and sensitively are a still better means to estimate cancer risk than measuring genotoxic substances and their metabolites in human body fluids. Using very sophisticated but nevertheless routinely applicable analytical procedures Hb-adducts of alkylating agents, aromatic amines and nitro aromatic compounds are determined routinely today. To extend the spectrum of biochemical effect monitoring further methods should be elaborated which put up with cleavage and separation of the adducted protein molecules as a measure of sample preparation. This way all sites of adduction as well as further proteins, like serum albumin could be used for HBM. DNA-adducts indicate the mutagenicity of a chemical substance as well as an elevated cancer risk. DNA-adducts therefore would be ideal parameters for HBM. Though there are very sensitive techniques for DNA adduct monitoring like P32-postlabelling and immunological methods they lack specificity. For elucidating the mechanism of carcinogenesis and for a broad applicability and comparability in epidemiological studies analytical methods must be elaborated which are strictly specific for the chemical structure of the DNA-adduct. Current analytical possibilities however meet their borders. In HBM studies with exposure to genotoxic chemicals especially the measurement of DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in white blood cells has become very popular. However, there is still a lack of well-established dose response relations between occupational or environmental exposures and the induction of 8-OHdG or formation of strand breaks which limits the applicability of these markers. Most of the biomarkers used in population studies are covered by standard operating procedures (SOPs) as well as by internal and external quality assessment schemes. Therefore, HBM results from the leading laboratories worldwide are analytically reliable and comparable. Newly upcoming substances of environmental relevance like perfluorinated compounds can rapidly be assessed in body fluids because there are very getting more and more difficult for the laboratories to keep up with a progress in instrumental analyses. In spite of this it will pay to reach the ultimate summit of HBM because it is the nly way to identify and quantify human exposure and risk, elucidate the mechanism of toxic effects and to ultimately decide if measures have to be taken to reduce exposure. Risk assessment and risk management without HBM lead to wrong risk estimates and cause inadequate measures. In some countries like in USA and in Germany, thousands of inhabitants are regularly investigated with respect to their internal exposure-to a broad range of environmentally occurring substances. For the evaluation of HBM results the German HBM Commission elaborates reference- and HBM-values. (C) 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.",32
"In the field of psychology, the topic of everyday life as a specific subject of inquiry has been afforded little attention. Indeed, everyday life has recently been analyzed mainly in psychological studies that examine people's ways of behaving and thinking when they act in situations termed as mundane and ordinary. These studies are mainly carried out in two fields of social psychology which we refer to in general terms as Social Cognition and Social Representation Theory. The aim of this paper is to examine how both these fields treat some of the features commonly attributed to everyday life. In particular, the features of familiarization, continuity and stability over time and automaticity are discussed in order to try to figure out meeting points between the two fields mentioned.",61

"Several studies suggest a relation between repeated exposure to extremely thin bodies in media and the perceptual and emotional disturbances of body representation in anorexia nervosa (AN). In this study, we utilized an exposure paradigm to investigate how perceptual experience modulates body appreciation in adolescents with AN as compared to healthy adolescents. Twenty AN patients and 20 healthy controls were exposed to pictures of thin or round models and were then required to express liking judgments about bodies of variable weight. Brief exposure to round models increased the liking judgments of round bodies but not those of thin bodies in healthy adolescents. Furthermore, exposure to round models increased the liking judgments of both thin and round bodies in adolescents with AN. Patients did not show any change of liking judgments after exposure to thin models. These results point to weak norm-based reshaping of body appreciation in AN patients. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"A key issue in fruit export is classification and sorting for acceptable marketing. In the present work, the image processing technique was employed to grade three varieties of oranges (Bam, Khooni and Thompson) separately. The reason for choosing this fruit as the object of the study was its abundant consumption worldwide. In this study, 14 parameters were extracted: area, eccentricity, perimeter, length/ area, blue value, green value, red value, width, contrast, texture, width/ area, width/ length, roughness, and length. Further, the ANFIS (Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System) method was utilized to estimate the orange mass from the data obtained using the image processing in three varieties. In ANFIS model, samples were divided into two sets, one with 70% for training set and the other one with 30% for testing set. The results of the present study demonstrated that the coefficient of determination (R-2) of the best model for Bam, Khooni and Thompson measured 0.948, 0.99, and 0.98, respectively. In addition, the results indicated that the estimation accuracy of the best model for Bam, Khooni and Thompson was measured as +/- 3.7 g, +/- 1.28 g, +/- 3.2 g, respectively. This result was very satisfactory for the application of ANFIS to estimate the orange mass.",90
"The paper presents a high-voltage integrated-circuit driver capable of producing analog voltages up to 300 V, using Dalsa's 0.8-mu m HV CMOS/DMOS process, suitable for MEMS and medical systems. The IC driver includes a HV operational amplifier (op-amp) with a class-B output stage, and HV analog switches with improved off-isolation performance. In contrast to previous frequency compensation schemes, where only one dominant pole occurs below the unity-gain bandwidth, the HV op-amp employs a novel frequency compensation topology with three poles and two zeros located within the unity-gain bandwidth, and is capable of driving large capacitive loads from 100 pF to 10 nF. Theoretical analysis of off-isolation of the HV analog switches is also reported and confirms the improvement in off-isolation performance.",60
"There has been increased interest in sleep disorders in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Studies in North America and Europe reported that the prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) is much higher in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) than in the general population. The aim of this study was to reveal the prevalence and clinical features of RLS in Japanese patients with IBD and investigate the influence of RLS on sleep quality and quality of life (QOL). The study included 80 outpatients with IBD who visited Nagasaki University Hospital between December 2012 and July 2014. All patients completed the international RLS study group rating scale, a validated measure of the presence of RLS. Sleep quality was assessed using the Japanese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and health-related QOL was assessed using the Japanese version of the 36-item short form healthy profile (SF-36) version 2. The prevalence of RLS in patients with IBD was 20%, including rates of 21.7% in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 17.6% in patients with CD. Among patients with CD, the proportion of women and serum level of CRP were higher in the RLS group than in the non-RLS group. Among those with UC, there were no differences in clinical characteristics between the RLS and non-RLS groups. Patients in the RLS group slept significantly less well than those in the non-RLS group (PSQI >5; 62.5 vs. 34.4%, P < 0.05). No significant relationships were observed between QOL indices and the presence of RLS (SF-36 physical score, 46.8 vs. 50.1; mental score, 43.8 vs. 45.7; role/social score, 48.1 vs. 49.2). RLS occurs frequently in Japanese patients with UC as well as CD. RLS affects sleep quality but not QOL, and it should be considered one of the causes of sleep disturbance in patients with IBD.",118
"One-hundred-thirty-one homeless, substance-dependent MSM were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of a contingency management (CM) intervention for reducing substance use and increasing healthy behavior. Participants were randomized into conditions that either provided additional rewards for substance abstinence and/or health-promoting/prosocial behaviors (""CM-full""; n = 64) or for study compliance and attendance only (""CM-lite""; n = 67). The purpose of this secondary analysis was to determine the affect of ASPD status on two primary study outcomes: methamphetamine abstinence, and engagement in prosocial/health-promoting behavior. Analyses revealed that individuals with ASPD provided more methamphetamine-negative urine samples (37.5%) than participants without ASPD (30.6%). When controlling for participant sociodemographics and condition assignment, the magnitude of this predicted difference increases to 10% and reached statistical significance (p < .05). On average, participants with ASPD earned fewer vouchers for health-promoting/prosocial behaviors than participants without ASPD ($10.21 [SD = $7.02] versus $18.38 [SD = $13.60]; p < .01). Participants with ASPD displayed superior methamphetamine abstinence outcomes regardless of CM schedule; even with potentially unlimited positive reinforcement, individuals with ASPD displayed suboptimal outcomes in achieving health-promoting/prosocial behaviors.

"Purpose: Macular optical coherence tomography (OCT) analysis can be used for quantitative measures of optic nerve atrophy at a location far from the optic nerve head. This recently led to the finding of microcystic macular edema (MME), that is vacuolar inclusions in the macular inner nuclear layer, in some glaucoma patients. The involvement of individual retinal layers is yet unclear in glaucoma. In this study we systematically investigated glaucoma-induced changes in macular layers to evaluate whether glaucoma-associated damage extends beyond the macular ganglion cell layer. Patients and Methods: We included 218 consecutive patients and 282 eyes with confirmed primary open-angle glaucoma or pseudoexfoliation glaucoma, and macular OCT in a cross-sectional observational study. Eyes were screened for presence of MME. Thickness of individual retinal layers was determined using a semiautomatic segmentation algorithm. Peripapillary nerve fiber layer thickness and mean defect in visual field testing were extracted from OCT and medical records, respectively. Results were compared with a small group of eyes with no apparent glaucoma. Results: We found MME in 5 eyes from 5 primary open-angle glaucoma patients and 3 eyes of 3 pseudoexfoliation glaucoma patients (2.8%). MME was confined to the inner nuclear layer in a perifoveal ring and was associated with thinning of the ganglion cell layer and thickening of the macular inner nuclear layer. Glaucoma eyes without MME showed a significant inverse correlation of inner nuclear layer thickness with glaucoma severity. Conclusions: Glaucomatous damage leads to a gradual thickening of the inner nuclear layer, which leads to MME in more severe glaucoma cases. These changes, along with nerve fiber loss and ganglion cell loss, may be summarized as glaucoma-associated retrograde maculopathy.",11
"General, spontaneous evaluations of strangers based on their faces have been shown to reflect judgments of these persons' intention and ability to harm. These evaluations can be mapped onto a 2D space defined by the dimensions trustworthiness (intention) and dominance (ability). Here we go beyond general evaluations and focus on more specific personality judgments derived from the Big Two and Big Five personality concepts. In particular, we investigate whether Big Two/Big Five personality judgments can be mapped onto the 2D space defined by the dimensions trustworthiness and dominance. Results indicate that judgments of the Big Two personality dimensions almost perfectly map onto the 2D space. In contrast, at least 3 of the Big Five dimensions (i.e., neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness) go beyond the 2D space, indicating that additional dimensions are necessary to describe more specific face-based personality judgments accurately. Building on this evidence, we model the Big Two/Big Five personality dimensions in real facial photographs. Results from 2 validation studies show that the Big Two/Big Five are perceived reliably across different samples of faces and participants. Moreover, results reveal that participants differentiate reliably between the different Big Two/Big Five dimensions. Importantly, this high level of agreement and differentiation in personality judgments from faces likely creates a subjective reality which may have serious consequences for those being perceived-notably, these consequences ensue because the subjective reality is socially shared, irrespective of the judgments' validity. The methodological approach introduced here might prove useful in various psychological disciplines.",63
"Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) play important roles in regulating the biological functions and underlying molecular mechanisms of glioma. Here, we investigated the expression level and biological function of linc-OIP5 in glioma. In the current study, we used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to determine the expression of linc-OIP5 in glioma tissues and in adjacent normal tissues. Level of linc-OIP5 was up-regulated in glioma tissues and significantly correlated with the advanced tumor stage (III/IV). Subsequently, the efficacy of knockdown of linc-OIP5 by linc-OIP5-small interfering RNA (siRNA) was evaluated in vitro, and we found that knockdown of linc-OIP5 can inhibit glioma cells proliferation, migration in vitro and tumor formation in vivo. Further mechanistic studies revealed the effect of linc-OIP5 knockdown on glioma cell phenotype at least partially through down-regulation of YAP and inhibition of Notch signaling pathway activity. Thus, our study provides evidence that linc-OIP5 is a potential therapeutic target and novel molecular biomarker for glioma. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.",37
"Interoception and exteroception for body signals are two different ways of perceiving the self: the first from within, the second from outside. We investigated the relationship between Interoceptive Accuracy (IAcc) and external perception of the body and we tested if seeing the body from an external perspective can affect IAcc. Fifty-two healthy female subjects performed a standard heartbeat perception task to assess the lAcc, before and after the Body Image Revealer (BIR), which is a body perception task designed to assess the different aspects of body-image. The performance of the lower lAcc group in the heartbeat perception task significantly improved after the exteroceptive task. These findings highlight the relations between interoceptive and exteroceptive body-representations, supporting the view that these two kinds of awareness are linked and interact with each other.

"Paget disease of bone is a chronic metabolic bone disorder characterized by increased bone resorption and new bone formation. The aim of this study is defining the role of inhibitors of canonical Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway in patients with Paget disease of bone. Scarce and contrasting results have been reported in literature. We studied 40 patients (15 females and 25 males) with radiological and scintigraphic evidence of Paget disease of bone and 40 healthy subjects matched by age and sex. N-propeptide of type I collagen, C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen, sclerostin, and Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1) were evaluated by blood samples in our laboratory. As expected, mean serum levels of bone turnover markers (N-propeptide of type I collagen and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen) were significantly higher in the Paget disease of bone group compared with the control group. No difference was observed between groups in Dickkopf-1 and sclerostin. Dickkopf-1 and sclerostin were never correlated with each other or with bone turnover markers. Sclerostin was positively correlated with age. In conclusion, our results suggest that the regulators of the Wnt-beta catenin pathway are not altered in patients with Paget disease of bone. The positive correlation we found between sclerostin and age in Paget disease of bone patients indicates that in comparative studies, sclerostin serum levels must be adjusted for age.",16
"A mathematical model for calculating steady non-sinusoidal mode of a complex electrical network is proposed, taking into account the distribution of overhead transmission lines parameters, suspension geometry and brand wires, availability of overhead ground-wire cable and the way of their grounding along the route of the line. Based on the calculation of complex network steady mode the fundamental losses are accounted which were caused by positive-sequence currents of the fundamental frequency, and the total losses caused by the actual currents of the fundamental frequency and high harmonic currents in wires and ground wires. The paper introduces the example of the steady mode calculation and the results of study of the effect on the loss of electric power suspension geometry of wires and overhead ground-wire cable.",50
"Background: Isoflavones are a class of phytoestrogens that has been considered important raw material for healthcare products, mainly as dietary supplements for hormone replacement and active ingredients in skin care cosmetics. Because of this, many scientific reviews are found regarding the extraction, analysis methods and biological activities of these compounds. However, it is emphasized that, to date, no studies have been found concerning technological mapping of patents involving isoflavones. Scope and approach: The present study aimed to map patents covering the last 20 years of technology innovation comprising isoflavones. To that, a patent survey was conducted between the years of 1994 - 2014 in an international patent database (Espacenet) using the title's keywords: isoflavones, genistein, daidzein, glycitein, biochanin A and formononetin. Key findings and conclusions: The resulting data allowed the identification of the major countries, universities and companies that invest in products containing these compounds. In addition, patents were separated into interest groups. The three clusters discussed in this study were: processes for obtaining enriched isoflavone fractions from different plant materials intended to healthcare products, such as dietary supplements; the use of isoflavones in cosmetic products; and the incorporation of isoflavones in micro and nanostructured systems to mask unpleasant tastes or overcome the low water solubility of bioactive forms. In conclusion, this study, along with other literature reviews, could assist in designing strategic research and worldwide development of new products containing isoflavones. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Hematological abnormalities are very common in the course of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Myelofibrosis is a bone marrow disorder in which there is excessive fibrous tissue formation in the bone marrow. Various benign and malignant disorders can cause or be associated with a diffuse increase in the bone marrow reticular tissue. Some diseases such as infections, neoplasms, and autoimmune diseases may also induce bone marrow fibrosis (secondary myelofibrosis). Cytopenia from autoimmune myelofibrosis (AIMF) in SLE is a rare condition. Here we present a case of AIMF associated with SLE and aim to emphasize on the other cause of cytopenia in SLE.",12
"The alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism represents an alternative to the enzyme telomerase in the maintenance of mammalian telomeres in 2560% of sarcomas and a minority of carcinomas (about 515%). ALT-positive cells are distinguished by long and heterogeneous telomere length distributions by terminal restriction fragment (TRF) Southern blotting. Another diagnostic marker of ALT is discrete nuclear co-localized signals of telomeric DNA and the promyelocytic leukaemia protein (PML), referred to as ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs). Recently, we detected smaller sized co-localized PML and telomere DNA (APB-like) bodies in endothelial cells adjacent to astrocytoma tumour cells in situ. In this study, we examined a wide variety of non-neoplastic tissues, and report that co-localized signals of PML and telomere DNA are present in endothelial, stromal, and some epithelial cells. Co-localized signals of PML and telomere DNA showed an increased frequency in non-neoplastic cells with DNA damage.

"OBJECTIVE: In the gastrointestinal neural system, the emergence of Lewy Body (LB) is usually earlier than the clinical diagnosis of Parkinson (PD) motor symptoms. Therefore, this study is aimed to explore whether the LB in the gastrointestinal tract of prodromal PD patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 98 paraffin embedded tissue specimens from 57 PD patients were collected in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University archives, as well as 98 tissue specimens of 90 non-PD patients undergone surgical resection. The pathological sections were stained by the immune-histochemistry method. The positive staining of aggregated alpha-Synuclein (a-alpha-syn) and phosphorylated alpha-Synuclein (p-alpha-syn) in gastrointestinal tract were counted to analyze the distribution of the expression of a/p-alpha-syn in the prodromal PD patients before diagnosis (0-5 years, 6-10 years, 11-20 years). RESULTS: According to results from the immunohistochemical staining of a/p-a-syn, 35 (52.23%) and 30 (44.78%) tissue blocks were positively stained respectively in total 67 tissue blocks provided from 39 prodromal PD patients. And there were 46 (46.94%) and 25 (25.51%) positive staining in 98 tissue blocks from the control group. In 31 tissue blocks collected from 18 PD patients, there were 19 (61.29%) and 15 (48.39%) tissue blocks with the a/p-alpha-syn positive staining. Compared with non-PD patients from the control group, the a-alpha-syn positive rate was not significantly increased in the pre-and post-diagnosis PD patients (p>0.05). However, p-alpha-syn of both groups increased significantly (p<0.05). Also, the positive expression rate of a/p-alpha-syn in the 6-10-year group was lower than that in the 0-5-year and 11-20-year, and the positive rate of the 0-5-year group was the highest (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: p-alpha-syn as the main component of Lewy body of nervous system in the gastrointestinal track may be used as a characteristic predictive marker of PD and the prevention of PD disease.",119
"Controlling the geometric parameters of the weld pool and the weld bead is the main method for getting better welding quality in industrial robotic welding. This paper presents the technology on a real-time welding process sensor, which is necessary to improve welding quality using an intelligent robot during the gas metal arc welding process. A set of vision systems, which consists of an active vision sensor and a passive vision sensor, has been designed. The clear, steady images of the weld pool were obtained by the passive vision part, and the images of the laser stripe projected on the weld bead were obtained by the active vision part, at the same time. The features of the acquired images were analyzed, and the geometric parameters of the weld cross section and the weld pool were successfully extracted from the images. The detection precision of the system was also analyzed.",90
"Two major endoglucanase genes (cel7B and cel5A) were cloned from Penicillium decumbens 114-2 using the method of modified thermal asymmetric interlaced polymerase chain reaction (TAIL-PCR). The result of Southern blotting suggested that P decumbens has a single copy of the cel5A gene and a single copy of the cel7B gene in its chromosomal DNA. The expression levels of cel5A and cel7B were determined by means of real-time quantitative PCR, suggesting that the two genes were coordinately expressed, and repressed by glucose and induced by cellulose. Both endoglucanase genes were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the recombinant proteins were purified. The recombinant Cel7B and Cel5A were both optimally active at 60 degrees C and pH 4.0. The recombinant Cel7B showed more than 8-fold, 30-fold, and 5-fold higher enzyme activities toward carboxymethyl cellulose, barley P-glucan, and PASC, respectively, in comparison with that of Cel5A. However, their activities toward pNPC and Avicel showed minor differences. The results suggested that Cel7B is a strict endoglucanase, whereas Cel5A showed processivity because of its relative higher ability to hydrolyze the crystal cellulose.",39
"We present Jump, a practical system for capturing high resolution, omnidirectional stereo (ODS) video suitable for wide scale consumption in currently available virtual reality (VR) headsets. Our system consists of a video camera built using off-the-shelf components and a fully automatic stitching pipeline capable of capturing video content in the ODS format. We have discovered and analyzed the distortions inherent to ODS when used for VR display as well as those introduced by our capture method and show that they are small enough to make this approach suitable for capturing a wide variety of scenes. Our stitching algorithm produces robust results by reducing the problem to one of pairwise image interpolation followed by compositing. We introduce novel optical flow and compositing methods designed specifically for this task. Our algorithm is temporally coherent and efficient, is currently running at scale on a distributed computing platform, and is capable of processing hours of footage each day.",2
"This article describes the development and characterization of the synergistic smart morphing aileron concept, which leverages the properties of two different smart material actuators to achieve performance that exceeds that of the constituent materials. Utilizing the relatively higher work density and phase transformation of shape memory alloys combined with the larger bandwidth and conformal bending of bonded piezoelectric macro-fiber composites, the resultant synergistic morphing design improves the range of static tip deflections, enabling the capability to hold more trim positions over long timescales while still quickly compensating for dynamic loading. By commanding an input of full-range square waves of 0.01-10 Hz to the actuators, first-order time responses were measured and characterized using a common methodology by tracking a relative time constant. Using this method, aeroelastic effects for each actuator and the combined system were characterized in a wind tunnel at 0 degrees angle of attack with flow speeds ranging from 0 to 15 m/s. This novel approach characterized a large-deflection morphing actuation system with multiple smart materials operating over different timescales. The combined system achieved additive amplitude while tracking the faster actuation response of the macro-fiber composite between 0.1 and 1 Hz.",103
"The traditional power control schemes for induction heating device mainly focus on the pulse frequency modulation (PFM) and the pulse density modulation. But they cannot solve the problems of power control, efficiency, and load-adaption well. This paper presents and analyzes the asymmetrical frequency modulation (AFM) control scheme used in the full-bridge series resonant inverter. With the proposed AFM control technique, the output power is controlled by two variables: the operation frequency and the division factor. Better efficiency performance can be achieved in the medium and low output power range when compared with PFM. The principles as well as the zero-voltage switching condition of the AFM are explained and the power losses of switches are analyzed. A control algorithm that schedules the three control modes of AFM is experimentally verified with a digital signal processor based induction heating prototype. The load-adaption, noise and thermal distribution problem of switches are also analyzed.",48
"Introduced the basic principle of synchronous rectification in low voltage high current fields. Using digital control's feature in switch power, a design scheme of SR digital Buck converter was put forward and analyzed the device choice. Designed all the circuit of the converter, designed and made a prototype. The experiment data were given including driving waveform and efficiency curve. One-cycle control strategy was made. To extend the using fields of the prototype, designed the intelligence communication interface. By means of experiment, the power supply has fast dynamic response and high precision and its efficiency can reach up to 95%.",48
"The present cross-sectional study tested a portion of the tripartite model of familial impacts on self-regulation (Morris et al., 2007) in reference to social competence during early adulthood. N = 302 young adults ages 18 to 24 years (64.9% female; 80.4% European American; 10% Hispanic) were recruited through Mechanical Turk (n = 254) and the local community (n = 48). All participants responded to anonymous online questionnaires about self-regulation, parenting practices, and interpersonal competence with same-sex peers and romantic partners. High parental acceptance and low psychological control were linked to high levels of self-regulation. High social competence in both relationship types was associated with high acceptance and self-regulation; lifetime romantic relationship experience also covaried with high romantic competence. Findings suggest that the tripartite model is applicable to interpersonal competence in emerging adulthood. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",18
"In this paper we propose a novel technique for tuning and enhancing performances of current conveyor based active circuits. The basic idea consists of judiciously adding controlled sources in the signal flow graph representing the active circuits. The potentiality of the proposed technique is showcased with five different examples (namely, enhancing performances of parallel and serial 'simplified circuits, enhancing performances of an fourth order ladder filter, tuning performances of an active second order filter, and tuning inductance value of active inductors), and its viability is supported with Spice simulation results.",56
"Background: Smoking is a leading cause of preventable death. Early studies based on samples of twins have linked the lifetime smoking practices to genetic predisposition. The flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) protein family consists of a group of enzymes that metabolize drugs and xenobiotics. Both FMO1 and FMO3 were potentially susceptible genes for nicotine metabolism process. Methods: In this study, we investigated the potential of FMO genes to confer risk of nicotine dependence via deep targeted sequencing in 2,820 study subjects comprising 1,583 nicotine dependents and 1,237 controls from European American and African American. Specifically, we focused on the two genomic segments including FMO1, FMO3, and pseudo gene FMO6P, and aimed to investigate the potential association between FMO genes and nicotine dependence. Both common and low-frequency/rare variants were analyzed using different algorithms. The potential functional significance of SNPs with association signal was investigated with relevant bioinformatics tools. Results: We identified different clusters of significant common variants in European (with most significant SNP rs6674596, p=.0004, OR=0.67, MAF_EA=0.14, FMO1) and African Americans (with the most significant SNP rs6608453, p=.001, OR=0.64, MAF_AA=0.1, FMO6P). No significant signals were identified through haplotype-based analyses. Gene network investigation indicated that both FMO1 and FMO3 have a strong relation with a variety of genes belonging to CYP gene families (with combined score greater than 0.9). Most of the significant variants identified were SNPs located within intron regions or with unknown functional significance, indicating a need for future work to understand the underlying functional significance of these signals. Conclusions: Our findings indicated significant association between FMO genes and nicotine dependence. Replications of our findings in other ethnic groups were needed in the future. Most of the significant variants identified were SNPs located within intronic regions or with unknown functional significance, indicating a need for future work to understand the underlying functional significance of these signals.",42
"Children participating in research, like other children, may be being maltreated. There is also potential for exposure to abuse during research. Research training, practices and protocols to respond to disclosure and discovery of abuse to protect both researchers and children may not be sufficiently robust. Our aim was to compare and contrast research practices reported in the literature related to protecting children and to recommend safer ways to conduct research. The simultaneous increase in research with children, along with an increased willingness to listen to child victims of abuse, means that researchers must consider the protection of children in the research setting. Twenty-three papers were identified in a literature review. These studies reported a wide variation of ethical considerations, methods, methodology and came from different disciplines. From the 23 papers, two overarching themes were identified: social justice and research and safer research. To make research safer teams should consider training, safety protocols and support for child protection, which includes support to report safeguarding concerns to social care. Further work is required to ensure that training, protocols and support are effective in facilitating researchers to identify and make appropriate child abuse referrals. Ethics practices in abuse research need further debate.",76
"Purpose: Sexual orientation affects individuals' health histories and is fundamental to providers' understanding of patients as a whole. Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GB-MSM) are vulnerable to certain health conditions, including HIV. The aim of this exploratory analysis was to examine factors associated with sexual orientation disclosure and communication with providers about GB-MSM health issues and to discuss implications. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional internet survey of GB-MSM (n = 202) in London-Middlesex, Ontario, Canada; analyses were limited to those with a regular primary care provider (n = 173). Blockwise regression models explored demographic, psychosocial, and healthcare-related factors associated with sexual orientation disclosure and physician-patient communication about GB-MSM-related health. Results: Just over seventy-one percent (71.1%) of participants reported that their primary care provider (PCP) knew their sexual orientation, and 44.5% had talked to them about GB-MSM health. Overt negative comments or being refused care based on sexual orientation occurred infrequently, although 26.6% reported their provider had assumed they were heterosexual. Being married to or living common-law with another man, more frequent experiences of homosexual prejudice, and higher quality assessment of provider's communication skills were associated with the PCP knowing respondents' sexual orientation. Greater internalized homonegativity was associated with not talking to a PCP about GB-MSM-related health issues. More frequent experiences of homosexual prejudice, higher assessment of provider communication, and having prior negative experiences with a PCP were significantly associated with talking to a PCP about GB-MSM health. Conclusion: The majority of our sample disclosed their sexual orientation; however, not all patients voluntarily disclose. Medical training and education in Canada, where specific rights protections exist for sexual orientation minority populations, should emphasize awareness of essential patient health information. Training should include information about GB-MSM health and building a foundation on how to speak with GB-MSM patients nonjudgmentally.",61
"Voltage scaling is a fundamental technique in the energy efficient computing field. Recent studies tackling this topic show degraded system reliability as frequency scales. To address this conflict, the subject of reliability aware power management (RAPM) has been extensively explored and is still under investigation. Heterogeneous Computing Systems (HCS) provide high performance potential which attracts researchers to consider these systems. Unfortunately, the existing scheduling algorithms for precedence constrained tasks with shared deadline in HCS do not adequately consider reliability conservation. In this study, we design joint optimization schemes of energy efficiency and system reliability for directed acyclic graph (DAG) by adopting the shared recovery technique, which can achieve high system reliability and noticeable energy preservation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to address the problem in HCS. The extensive comparative evaluation studies for both randomly generated and some real-world applications graphs show that our scheduling algorithms are compelling in terms of enhancement of both system reliability and energy saving.

"At the end of June, over 120 microbiologists from 18 countries gathered in Dundee, Scotland for the fourth edition of the Young Microbiologists Symposium on 'Microbe Signalling, Organisation and Pathogenesis'. The aim of the symposium was to give early career microbiologists the opportunity to present their work in a convivial environment and to interact with senior world-renowned scientists in exciting fields of microbiology research. The meeting was supported by the Microbiology Society, the Society of Applied Microbiology and the American Society for Microbiology with further sponsorship from the European Molecular Biology Organisation and the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In this report, we highlight some themes that emerged from the many interesting talks and poster presentations, as well as some of the other activities that were on offer at this energetic meeting.",30
"Seed germination and early seedling establishment are critical stages during a plants life cycle. These stages are precisely regulated by multiple internal factors, including phytohormones and environmental cues such as light. As a family of small molecules discovered in wildfire smoke, karrikins (KARs) play a key role in various biological processes, including seed dormancy release, germination regulation, and seedling establishment. KARs show a high similarity with strigolactone (SL) in both chemical structure and signaling transduction pathways. Current evidence shows that KARs may regulate seed germination by mediating the biosynthesis and/or signaling transduction of abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellin (GA) and auxin [indoleacetic acid (IAA)]. Interestingly, KARs regulate seed germination differently in different species. Furthermore, the promotion effect on seedling establishment implies that KARs have a great potential application in alleviating shade avoidance response, which attracts more and more attention in plant molecular biology. In these processes, KARs may have complicated interactions with phytohormones, especially with IAA. In this updated review, we summarize the current understanding of the relationship between KARs and SL in the chemical structure, signaling pathway and the regulation of plant growth and development. Further, the crosstalk between KARs and phytohormones in regulating seed germination and seedling development and that between KARs and IAA during shade responses are discussed. Finally, future challenges and research directions for the KAR research field are suggested.",30
"Replacing mouse Cyp1a with human CYP1A enables the humanized CYP1A mice to mimic human metabolism of the dietary carcinogen, 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), by N-2-hydroxylation to a proximate carcinogen. Our previous study demonstrated that PhIP, combined with the dextrin sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, induces colon carcinogenesis in hCYP1A mice. Here, we employed whole exome sequencing and found multiple gene mutations in PhIP/DSS-induced colon tumors. Mutations in the exon 3 of Ctnnb1/-catenin, however, were the predominant events. We further sequenced the key fragments of Apc, Ctnnb1, and Kras, because mutations of these genes in the humans are commonly found as the drivers of colorectal cancer. Mutations on either codon 32 or 34 in the exon 3 of Ctnnb1 were found in 39 out of 42 tumors, but no mutation was found in either Apc or Kras. The sequence context of codons 32 and 34 suggests that PhIP targets +3G in a TGGA motif of Ctnnb1. Since mutations that activate Wnt signal is a major driving force for human colorectal cancers, we conclude that the mutated -catenin is the driver in PhIP/DSS-induced colon carcinogenesis. This result suggests that the colon tumors in hCYP1A mice mimic human colorectal carcinogenesis not only in the dietary etiology involving PhIP, but also in the aberrant activation of the Wnt signaling pathway as the driving force.

"Chemokines are a family of small cytokines that share a typical key structure that is stabilized by disulfide bonds between the cysteine residues at the NH2-terminal of the protein, and they are secreted by a great variety of cells in several different conditions. Their function is directly dependent on their interactions with their receptors. Chemokines are involved in cell maturation and differentiation, infection, autoimmunity, cancer, and, in general, in any situation where immune components are involved. However, their role in postfracture inflammation and fracture healing is not yet well established. In this article, we will discuss the response of chemokines to bone fracture and their potential roles in postfracture inflammation and healing based on data from our studies and from other previously published studies.",30
"Bovine milk lipids (BML) contain a number of bioactive substances with positive as well as negative properties, mainly in the class of fatty acids. Besides trans fatty acids (TFA), conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) are of particular interest. Apart from ruminant meat products the main source of CLA in food are BML. Although TFA as well as saturated fatty acids (12:0-16:0) are thought to be positively correlated with atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease, CLA are considered antiatherogenic. Further, CLA are reported to reduce adipose fat and to have anticarcinogenic properties. The varying CLA and TFA contents of lipids from milk and dairy products are positively correlated with one another. However, TFA are also negatively correlated with 12:0-16:0 in BML. Anticarcinogenic effects are also ascribed to butyric acid as well as to some phospholipids and ether lipids present in BML. Moreover, the essential fatty acids 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 are found in BML which are involved in a variety of biochemical processes and thus have numerous functions in human metabolism. Contents of the individual bioactive components of BML are summarised taking into account also seasonal variations. The total content of bioactive substances in BML is approximately 75% but their overall impact on human health considering benefits and drawbacks is difficult to assess.",32
"Embedded real-time software systems (ESS) play an important role in almost every aspect of our daily lives. We do rely on them to be functionally correct and to adhere to timing-constraints ensuring that their computational results are always delivered in time. Violations of the timing-constraints of a safety-critical ESS, such as an airplane or a medical control device, can have disastrous economic and social consequences. Identifying and correcting such violations is therefore an important and challenging research topic. In this article we address this challenge and describe a rigorous approach for the timing analysis of programs and for proving its results precise. In practice most important is the worst-case execution time (WCET) of an ESS, that is, the maximal running time of the system on a specified hardware. A WCET analysis needs to provide a formal guarantee that a system meets its timing-constraints even in the worst case. This requires to compute a safe and tight bound for the execution time of a program. Existing WCET tools, however, are usually not able to guarantee that there is a feasible system trace that takes indeed as long as stated by the computed execution time bound: often, due to the employed abstractions during static analysis a computed WCET bound overestimates the actual WCET bound, since loop bounds and other timing relevant program properties their computation is based on are computed for spurious infeasible system traces that can be ruled out by a path-sensitive program abstraction and analyzing program resources. In this article we present an approach for inferring and proving WCET bounds precise. This approach guarantees that the WCET bound is computed for a feasible system trace. This is achieved by combining WCET computation with path-wise symbolic execution in an abstraction refinement loop. This way, symbolic execution can be targeted and limited to relevant program parts thereby taming and avoiding the usually prohibitive computational costs of symbolic execution with a full path coverage. Moreover, our approach improves the quality of the underlying WCET analysis, since it automatically tightens the bound until it is proven precise, thereby improving the precision of the initially computed WCET bound. Our overall approach is an anytime algorithm, i.e., it can be stopped at any time without violating the soundness of its results. If run until termination, the WCET bound is proven precise, by automatically inferring additional constraints from spurious traces and using these constraints in the abstraction refinement We implemented our approach in the r-TuBound WCET tookhain and tested it on challenging benchmarks from the WCET community. Our experimental results underline the advantage of using symbolic methods for proving WCET bounds precise, at a moderate cost (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",24
"The temporal pole (TP) has been associated with diverse functions of social cognition and emotion processing. Although the underlying mechanism remains elusive, one possibility is that TP acts as domain-general hub integrating socioemotional information. To test this, 26 participants were presented with 60 empathy-evoking film clips during fMRI scanning. The film clips were preceded by a linguistic sad or neutral context and half of the clips were accompanied by sad music. In line with its hypothesized role, TP was involved in the processing of sad context and furthermore tracked participants' empathic concern. To examine the neuromodulatory impact of TP, we applied nonlinear dynamic causal modeling to a multisensory integration network from previous work consisting of superior temporal gyrus (STG), fusiform gyrus (FG), and amygdala, which was extended by an additional node in the TP. Bayesian model comparison revealed a gating of STG and TP on fusiform-amygdalar coupling and an increase of TP to FG connectivity during the integration of contextual information. Moreover, these backward projections were strengthened by emotional music. The findings indicate that during social cognition, TP integrates information from different modalities and top-down modulates lower-level perceptual areas in the ventral visual stream as a function of integration demands.",62
"Brain network alterations in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been the subject of much investigation, but the biological mechanisms underlying these alterations remain poorly understood. Here, we aim to identify the changes in brain networks in patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and provide an accurate algorithm for classification of these patients from healthy control subjects (HC) by using a graph theoretical approach and advanced machine learning methods. Multivariate Granger causality analysis was performed on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data of 34 AD, 89 MCI, and 45 HC to calculate various directed graph measures. The graph measures were used as the original feature set for the machine learning algorithm. Filter and wrapper feature selection methods were applied to the original feature set to select an optimal subset of features. An accuracy of 93.3% was achieved for classification of AD, MCI, and HC using the optimal features and the naive Bayes classifier. We also performed a hub node analysis and found that the number of hubs in HC, MCI, and AD were 12, 10, and 9, respectively, suggesting that patients with AD experience disturbance of critical communication areas in their brain network as AD progresses. The findings of this study provide insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying MCI and AD. The proposed classification method highlights the potential of directed graph measures of rs-fMRI data for identification of the early stage of AD. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1
"Maize dwarf mosaic virus (MDMV) is a widespread pathogenic virus that causes serious loss of yield in maize (Zea mays). RNA interference (RNAi) triggered by hairpin RNA (hpRNA) transcribed from a transgenic inverted-repeat sequence is an effective way to defend against viruses in plants. In this study, an hpRNA expression vector containing a sense arm and an antisense arm of 150 bp separated by an intron of the maize actin gene was constructed to target the P1 protein (protease) gene of MDMV and used to transform Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105. The transformed Agrobacterium strain was used to transform maize embryonic calli isolated from immature embryos by an improved culture technique. In all, 46 plants were regenerated after stringent hygromycin B selection, and 18 of them were certified to be positive by PCR amplification. Of these positive plants, 13 were grown to produce offspring, and nine were identified by Southern blotting to have the transgene integrated with one or two copies. The resistance of three T(2) lines was evaluated in a field trial of dual MDMV inoculation in two environments and was found to be improved compared with the non-transformed control. The disease indexes of the transgenic plant lines h2, 13, and h1 were not significantly different from the highly resistant control line H9-21. The viral titers of the inoculated plants were detected by double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA), and the result was in accord with the resistance evaluated in the field trial. The addition of uniconazole S3307 (0.25 mg l(-1)) and ABT root-promoting powder (0.5 mg l(-1)) showed a significant improvement of hardening in regenerated plantlets, which were stronger and generated a better fibrous root system than the control. This improvement could facilitate the transgenic operation of maize.",39
"This paper is focused on optimization based design methodology and application of PID controller in restructured, competitive electricity market environment, for AGC problem. The paper compares two search algorithms for designing of PID controller used for AGC in multiarea power system. The optimal parameters of PID controller have been determined with the use of Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA). A deregulated scenario has been considered to develop the model of the multiarea AGC scheme. This paper presents that the ICA tuned PID (ICA-PID) controller can optimally regulate the generators output and can provide the best dynamic response of frequency and tie-line power on a load perturbation. The performance of proposed controller has been checked on 2-area thermal power system and 3-area thermal-hydro power system with the consideration of generation rate constraint (GRC). The results obtained by ICA-PID controller and genetic algorithm tuned (GA-PID) controller have been compared on the basis of performance parameters (settling time and oscillations). It is seen that ICA-PID controller shows the better performance as compared to GA-PID controller. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",59
"Raspberry waste, obtained from two cultivars, Meeker (ERM) and Willamette (ERW) was subjected to evaluation antioxidants and antitumour activities as a potential source of phenolics. Some phenolic acids and flavonoids were identified and quantified by HPLC. Antioxidant activity was tested by measuring ability to scavenge DPPH center dot and (OH)-O-center dot by ESR spectroscopy. IC50DPPH center dot varied from 0.67 for ERM to 0.54 mg/mL for ERW, while IC50 center dot OH values varied from 3.73 for ERM to 1.23 mg/mL for ERW. Cytotoxic activity was investigated using in vivo model of Ehrlich Ascite carcinoma cells (EAC) in mice. Pretreatment with extracts exhibited potent cytotoxic activity against EAC cells (up to 60%) and both extracts inhibited the tumour growth. Activity of xanthine oxidase (XOD) was extremely increased in pretreated animals, while the activity of enzyme complex glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) was significantly increased. This study suggests that raspberry pomace could be used as nutraceutic resource and functional food ingredient.",14
"There is a consensus in the cardiac stem cell biology field that human embryonic stem cell derived-cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) are immature and do not resemble human adult cardiomyocytes, either phenotypically or transcriptionally. One striking difference between hESC-CMs and mature adult cardiomyocytes is their morphology. hESC-CMs grown in vitro are pleomorphic in shape and have no clear sarcomere organization; conversely, adult cardiomyocytes are rod-shaped with an average length-to-width (aspect) ratio of 7:1 and display a highly organized internal cytoskeletal structure. By combining multiple cues, i.e. substrate stiffness and topographical features, it may be possible to create a more physiologically-relevant model that better recapitulates the architecture of the native human heart which will aid in regenerative medicine therapies, disease modeling, drug testing, developmental and cardiotoxicity studies. Prior work in our lab used microcontact printing on glass slides to control the cell shape to improve the maturation of hESC-CMs. Since then, new work has focused on patterning methods on more compliant substrates using both microcontact printing, as well as a sacrificial polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) film. In this proceeding, the advantages and disadvantages of the above methods will be discussed in relationship to hESC-CM maturation.",31
"Recent studies have demonstrated the benefits of osteocalcin (OCN) on glucose homeostasis and metabolic dysregulation. However, its role in body composition and vascular function remains unknown. This study was designed to examine changes in metabolic parameters and body composition as well as arterial stiffness after OCN treatment in type 2 diabetic rats. Adult male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were fed chow or high fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks, and then diabetes was induced with an injection of low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) and treated daily with intraperitoneal injections of OCN for 12 weeks. Our data showed that OCN treatment improved glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism. Further analysis revealed that OCN treatment resulted in increased insulin sensitivity. In addition, untreated diabetic rats experienced significant weight loss, whereas OCN-treated rats better maintained body weight (300.75 +/- 38.14 g vs. 335.50 +/- 23.70, p = 0.005). OCN also changed body composition, as evidenced by reduced body fat mass, specifically abdominal fat mass. OCN-treated diabetic rats also demonstrated decreased pulse-wave velocity, indicating of improved arterial stiffness. Taken together, our findings in the current study revealed that OCN therapy prevents arteriosclerosis in an induced diabetic rat model by exerting beneficial effects on glucose levels, insulin sensitivity, lipid metabolites, and body composition changes.",121
"This paper presents an evaluation of the performance of two instrumented sections of a geosynthetic-reinforced soil wall, 5.6 m high, constructed using a lateritic fine-grained soil. Two sections with identical layout of a nonwoven and a woven geotextile were monitored for comparison purposes. The unconfined tensile stiffness of the nonwoven geotextile was three times smaller than that of the woven geotextile. This allowed direct evaluation of the effect of soil confinement on geotextile stiffness. Instrumentation was used to measure face displacements, reinforcement displacement and strains, and soil matric suction. Rainfall occurred both during and after construction, which facilitated evaluation of the effect of soil wetting on the walls performance. Ultimate and serviceability limit state analyses were conducted to gain further insight into the performance of the two walls. The results show that the performance of the section reinforced with nonwoven geotextile was equivalent to the one reinforced with woven geotextile, even after the observed reduction in matric suction after rainfall. For both sections, the overall deformations occurred during construction. Negligible deformations were observed during service. Maximum face displacements were measured in the lowest instrumented layer for the nonwoven geotextile section whereas it was in the highest layer for the woven geotextile section. These behaviours of face displacement distributions can be the result of the significant differences in global stiffness of the sections. Design analyses and field performance show that soil confinement has a beneficial effect on the nonwoven geotextile stiffness. The significant contribution of the soil cohesion of the lateritic soil played an important role in the behaviour of the nonwoven geotextile-reinforced wall.",93
"In this study, an electric-vehicle-based thermal management system was designed for dual energy sources. An experimental platform developed in a previous study was modified. Regarding the mechanical components, a heat exchanger with a radiator, proportional valve, coolant pipes, and coolant pump was appropriately integrated. Regarding the electric components, two heaters emulating waste heat were controlled using two programmable power supply machines. A rapid-prototyping controller with two temperature inputs and three outputs was designed. Rule-based control strategies were coded to maintain optimal temperatures for the emulated proton exchange membrane fuel cells and lithium batteries. To evaluate the heat power of dual energy sources, driving cycles, energy management control, and efficiency maps of energy sources were considered for deriving time-variant values. The main results are as follows: (a) an advanced mechatronics platform was constructed; (b) a driving cycle simulation was successfully conducted; and (c) coolant temperatures reached their optimal operating ranges when the proportional valve, radiator, and coolant pump were sequentially controlled. The benefits of this novel electric-vehicle-based thermal management system are (a) high-efficiency operation of energy sources, (b) low occupied volume integrated with energy sources, and (c) higher electric vehicle traveling mileage. This system will be integrated with real energy sources and a real electric vehicle in the future.",55
"The present study assessed a short training experiment to improve spatial abilities using two tools based on virtual technologies: one focused on manipulation of specific geometric virtual pieces, and the other consisting of virtual orienteering game. The two tools can help improve spatial abilities required for many engineering problem-solving procedures. The results indicated that training activities improved the components of space ability (mental rotation, spatial visualization, and spatial orientation). In addition, it was concluded that there were no differences between men and women with respect to spatial ability levels before or after the training experiment. This fact resulted from masked training relating to daily living and leisure activities that are usually indistinctly performed by men and women in developed and industrialized countries.",81
"BACKGROUND: The incidence of pregnancy in advanced age among women is increasing because of the availability of assisted reproduction, although the long-term health consequences are not known. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of pregnancy in advanced age on the occurrence of cardiovascular events in a large cohort of postmenopausal women. STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed the data for 72,221 women aged 50-79 years who were enrolled in the observational arm of the Women's Health Initiative study. We determined the effect of pregnancy in advanced age (last pregnancy at age >= 40 year) on the risk of ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death over a mean period (+/- standard deviation) of 12 +/- 1 years using Cox Proportional Hazards analysis after adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: A total of 3306 of the 72,221 participants (4.6%) reported pregnancy in advanced age. Compared with pregnancy in normal age, the rates of ischemic stroke (3.8% vs 2.4%), hemorrhagic stroke (1.0% vs 0.5%), and cardiovascular death (3.9% vs 2.3%) were significantly higher among women with pregnancy in advanced age. In multivariate analysis, women with pregnancy in advanced age were 50% more likely to experience a hemorrhagic stroke (hazard ratio, 1.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-2.1) after adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, congestive heart failure, systolic blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, alcohol use, and cigarette smoking. There was no significant difference in the risk of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death among women with pregnancy in advanced age after adjustment for potential confounders. CONCLUSION: Women with pregnancy at an advanced age have a higher risk for hemorrhagic stroke in the postmenopausal period.",111
"The effectiveness of limestone sand fines (material finer than 0.063 mm) in controlling durability performance of slag cement concrete was investigated in an experimental program. Slag cement concrete specimens incorporating limestone aggregate were produced in two water-cement ratios leading to moderate and high-level durability. Linear regression analysis was applied to evaluate the rates and significance of change in durability performance parameters of concrete at varied levels of fines content ranging between 0 and 15%. Significant relationships between performance parameters (compressive strength, water penetration resistance, chloride migration coefficient, resistivity and abrasion resistance) and fines content were found in statistical analysis depending on the water-cement ratio. Compared to low water cement ratio concrete specimens, the contribution of the fines on durability was more prominent for the concrete mixes with high water-cement ratio. The paper also presents a case-study on durability assessment in an on-going marine infrastructure project involving Izmit Bay Crossing Suspension Bridge. The findings obtained from the field conform with the output of this research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",97
"Nanostructured cobalt oxide (Co3O4) has been regarded to be of great interest for catalysis, gas sensors, and energy conversion/storage. In this paper, we reported a water vapor-assisted thermal oxidation approach for the scalable synthesis of free-standing Co3O4 nanowires with controlled size, crystallization, and spatial density. Thermodynamic calculation was carried out to understand the fundamental mechanism of the water vapor-assisted nanowire formation process. For the first time, we found the incorporation of water vapor in the growth system modified the nanowires formation pathway. Cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH)(2)) was recognized to take a critical intermediate role during the growth. The proposed mechanism was further verified by understanding the influence of various growth parameters on the thermal oxidation process and product morphology. It was observed that the feeding rate of water vapor and type of oxygen source have a critical influence on the spatial density of Co3O4 nanowires while the temperature shows a dominant effect on the product morphology. Finally, the representative Co3O4 products were characterized for their composition, optical and magnetic properties. This study accumulates deeper understanding on the fundamentals of water vapor-assisted thermal growth of metal oxide nanostructures and successfully provides a facile approach for the scale production of Co3O4 nanowires for future applications.

"Purpose: The objective of this multicenter cross-sectional study was to investigate the relationship of nocturnal polyuria in patients with common lifestyle related diseases and overactive bladder, with special attention to hypertension. Materials and Methods: After baseline assessment, patients recorded 24-hour urinary frequency/ volume, blood pressure and heart rate for 3 days. They were stratified into 4 groups based on mean blood pressure, including no hypertension, and controllable, untreated and uncontrolled hypertension, respectively. Results: The 2,353 eligible patients, who had urinary urgency once or more per week and 1 or more nocturnal toilet visits, were enrolled from 543 sites in Japan. Of these patients complete data, including the 24-hour frequency volume chart, were collected from 1,271. Multivariable analyses showed a statistically significant association of nocturnal polyuria with increasing age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.05, p < 0.001) and gender (women vs men OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59-0.96, p = 0.02), and for controllable (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.83-1.460), untreated (OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.55-4.45) and uncontrolled (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.81-1.62) hypertension vs no hypertension (p = 0.005). However, when assessed separately in men and women, hypertension and heart rate were significantly associated with nocturnal polyuria in women alone (p = 0.01 and 0.03, respectively). Lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia were significantly associated with nocturnal polyuria in men alone (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The current study demonstrates that nocturnal polyuria was significantly associated with age, male gender, and untreated hypertension in patients with lifestyle related diseases and overactive bladder. The association between hypertension and nocturnal polyuria was significant in women alone.",17
"The primary working mechanism behind nanofluids thermal conductivity can be distinguished as one of the most controversial issues of nanofluids. Between several theories proposed in literature, nanopartides' clustering is the sole mechanism that can be observed even at the micro-scale level. Several parameters including nanofluid preparation method, particles concentration, particles morphology, temperature, and elapsed time are experimentally altered to investigate the role of nanoparticles micro-clusters in nanofluids thermal conductivity. It is observed that a minor variation in the altering parameters, would lead a remarkable change in the micro-clusters configuration and subsequently, in the thermal conductivity of nanofluids. In this paper, it is focused on this phenomenon by introducing a new application of image processing as a tool to study the morphological characteristics of micron sized clusters. Through this approach, it is demonstrated that higher thermal conductivity is obtained when particles micro-clusters are well percolated all over the base fluid. As a result, well-diffused percolating micro-structures are known to have a significant role in heat conduction of nanofluids. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",90
"Electrochemistry coupled to liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry was used for simulating the biological and environmental fate of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as well as for studying the PAH degradation behavior during electrochemical remediation. Pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene were selected as model compounds and oxidized within an electrochemical thin-layer cell equipped with boron-doped diamond electrode. Atpotentials of 1.2 and 1.6 V vs. Pd/H-2,H- quinones were found to be the major oxidation products for both investigated PAHs. These quinones belong to a large group of PAH derivatives referred to as oxygenated PAHs, which have gained increasing attention in recent years due to their high abundance in the environment and their significant toxicity. Separation of oxidation products allowed the identification of two pyrene quinone and three benzo[a]pyrene quinone isomers, all of which are known to be formed via photooxidation and during mammalian metabolism. The good correlation between electrochemically generated PAH quinones and those formed in natural processes was also confirmed by UV irradiation experiments and microsomal incubations. At potentials higher than 2.0 V, further degradation of the initial oxidation products was observed which highlights the capability of electrochemistry to be used as remediation technique.

"Reliable and scalable Ambient Intelligence means a distributed system of agents that are capable of working together or autonomously, depending on the requirements of the situation. In previous research we have argued in favor of the use of a representation for context information that can be distributed among agents, so that each agent knows only the information that is relevant to its activity. Recognizing interesting information or relevant situations is done by using context patterns - graph patterns with potentially unknown nodes and edges labeled with regular expressions. In this context, a major challenge is for agents to use a graph matching algorithm that is adequate to the possibilities of the devices on which the agents are running. Moreover, it is necessary that the algorithm is able to provide partial matches. This paper presents an algorithm specifically designed for this problem, that uses growing partial matches to obtain the maximum sub-graph of the context graph that matches (part of) the context pattern. Experiments were performed with the algorithm and its performance has been compared with that of other algorithms adapted to our problem.",92
"In recent years, much research has focused its attention on Ambient Intelligence (AmI). Its potential applications to smart homes, hospitals, health monitoring or daily life assistance make this paradigm a very promising field of research that can have a great and positive impact in our lives. The combination of AmI environments and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) has emerged as a perfect solution for the development of this kind of applications. However, there are many challenges to be addressed before such applications can be put into practice. In this paper, we propose an architecture based on MAS aimed to build rehabilitation systems for people with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) and explain how this architecture has been applied for the development of Vi-SMARt: a system for defining and planning therapies for people with ABI, and to control and evaluate their rehabilitation process.",92
"Metabonomics has been applied in many bio-related scientific fields. Nevertheless, some animal research works are shown to fail when they are extended to humans. Therefore, it is essential to figure out suitable animal modeling to mimic human metabolism so that animal findings can serve humans. In this study, two kinds of commonly selected body fluids, serum and urine, from humans and various experimental animals were characterized by integration of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy with multivariate statistical analysis to identify the interspecies metabolic differences and similarities at a baseline physiological status. Our results highlight that the dairy cow and pig may be an optimal choice for transportation and biodistribution studies of drugs and that the Kunming (KM) mouse model may be the most effective for excretion studies of drugs, whereas the Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat could be the most suitable candidate for animal modeling under overall considerations. The biochemical pathways analyses further provide an interconnection between genetic evolution and metabolic variations, where species evolution most strongly affects microbial biodiversity and, consequently, has effects on the species-specific biological substances of biosynthesis and corresponding biological activities. Knowledge of the metabolic effects from species difference will enable the construction of better models for disease diagnosis, drug metabolism, and toxicology research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

"Background/Objective: We examined seasonality and winter seasonal affective disorder (SAD) in the Old Order Amish of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, a unique population that prohibits use of network electric light in their homes. Methods: We estimated SAD using the seasonal pattern assessment questionnaire (SPAQ) in 1306 Amish adults and compared the frequencies of SAD and total SAD (i.e., presence of either SAD or subsyndromal-SAD) between men and women, young and old, and awareness of (ever vs. never heard about) SAD. Heritability of global seasonality score (GSS) was estimated using the maximum likelihood method, including a household effect to capture shared environmental effects. Results: The mean (+/- SD) GSS was 4.36 (+/- 3.38). Prevalence was 0.84% (95% CI: 0.36-1.58) for SAD and 2.59% (95% CI: 1.69-3.73) for total SAD. Heritability of GSS was 0.14 +/- 0.06 (SE) (p = 0.002) after adjusting for age, gender, and household effects. Limitations: Limitations include likely overestimation of the rates of SAD by SPAQ, possible selection bias and recall bias, and limited generalizability of the study. Conclusions: In the Amish, GSS and SAD prevalence were lower than observed in earlier SPAQ-based studies in other predominantly Caucasian populations. Low heritability of SAD suggests dominant environmental effects. The effects of awareness, age and gender on SAD risk were similar as in previous studies. Identifying factors of resilience to SAD in the face of seasonal changes in the Amish could suggest novel preventative and therapeutic approaches to reduce the impact of SAD in the general population.

"The aim of this study was to develop a novel multifunctional nanoparticle, which encapsulates SPION and Gemcitabine in PLGA +/- PEG to form multifunctional drug delivery system. For this aim, super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) were simultaneously synthesized and encapsulated with Gemcitabine (Gem) in PLGA +/- PEG copolymers via W/O/W double emulsification method. Optimum size and encapsulation efficiency for radiosensitization, hyperthermia and diagnostic applications were considered and the preparation parameters systematically were investigated and physicochemical characteristics of optimized nanoparticle were studied. Then SPION-PLGA and PLGA-Gem nanoparticles were prepared with the same optimized parameters and the toxicity of these nanoparticles was compared with Gemcitabine in human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7). The optimum preparation parameters were obtained with Gem/polymer equal to 0.04, SPION/polymer equal to 0.8 and 1% sucrose per 20 mg of polymer. The hydrodynamic diameters of all nanoparticles were under 200 nm. Encapsulation efficiency was adjusted between 13.2% to 16.1% for Gemcitabine and 48.2% to 50.1% for SPION. In-vitro Gemcitabine release kinetics had controlled behavior. Enhancement ratios for PLGA-Gem and SPION-PLGA-Gem at concentration of nanoparticles equal to IC50 of Gemcitabine were 1.53 and 1.89 respectively. The statistical difference was significant (p-value = 0.006 for SPION-PLGA-Gem and p-value = 0.015 for PLGA-Gem compared with Gemcitabine). In conclusion, we have successfully developed a Gemcitabine loaded super paramagnetic PLGA-Iron Oxide multifunctional drag delivery system. Future work includes in-vitro and in-vivo investigation of radiosensitization and other application of these nanoparticles.",14
"Aims: To seek feedback from clinical oncologists as to their experiences of specialty training and, where applicable, the transition to working as a consultant in the National Health Service. Materials and methods: All clinical oncologists gaining a Certificate of Completion of Training between 1 July 2012 and 30 June 2014 were identified through records held by the Royal College of Radiologists and approached in May 2015 to take part in an online survey. Results: The survey was completed by 38 of 80 clinical oncologists invited to take part (48% response rate). Most respondents (>87%) agreed that specialty training equipped them well with clinical skills in radiotherapy planning, systemic therapy and tumour site diagnosis and treatment. This fell to 58% with advanced radiotherapy techniques. Of the non-clinical skills, respondents felt training had equipped them less to deal with leadership and management (53%) and research (48%) than clinical governance (61%). Despite wanting to do so, 42% of respondents did not undertake any out-of-programme (OOP) activity to gain new skills. Most of those respondents who did undertake OOP activity agreed that it helped to prepare them for their first consultant post. There is broad support for the FRCR Examination. The First FRCR Examination modules in physics, pharmacology, tumour biology and radiobiology were seen to be very relevant to clinical practice by 50% or more of respondents. The Final FRCR Examination was seen as essential in a technical specialty like clinical oncology by 92% of respondents. Working as a new consultant, the survey revealed a heavy workload for most respondents, with 69% always or almost always working beyond contracted hours. Other issues of concern identified were discrepancies in advertised consultant job plans and ineffectiveness of the job plan review process. The traine-econsultant transition is often a difficult time, yet only 19% of respondents were allocated a formal mentor. Most respondents had to rely on informal arrangements in seeking support and advice from medical colleagues. Conclusions: In general, respondents were satisfied with their specialty training and the transition from training to working as a new consultant. Areas for possible improvement have been identified for employers as well as those involved in organising specialty training. (C) 2016 The Royal College of Radiologists. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Japan is leading the global trend of decreasing birth rates and the graying of society. In this study we examine women's changing gender and intergenerational relationships and how these affect their concerns and hopes for their futures. Many of the 121 midlife women (aged 45-55) interviewed viewed themselves as sandwiched between their mothers-in-law and actual or potential daughters-in-law, at the nadir of intergenerational status within their families, in large part due to changing social patterns in marriage and birth rates. Doubts about the marriageability of their sons arising from role expectations for brides to care for parents-in-law cause concern for many and highlight the gendered and intergenerational nature of aging concerns. Yet, midlife in the 21st century, with changing gender and intergenerational roles, appears to create opportunities for many Japanese women to reflect on the meaning of the next stage of their lives. Changing gender and intergenerational relationships may contribute to their hopes to live a life of self-actualization and to be true to one's self (jibun rashiku ikiru).",77
"The circularly orthogonal moments have been widely used in many computer vision applications. Unfortunately, they suffer from two errors namely numerical integration error and geometric error, which heavily degrade their reconstruction accuracy and pattern recognition performance. This paper describes a new kind of circularly orthogonal moments based on Chebyshev rational function. Unlike the conventional circularly orthogonal moments which have been defined in a unit disk, the proposed moment is defined in whole polar coordinates domain. In addition, given an order n, its radial projection function is smoother and oscillates at lower frequency compared with the existing circularly orthogonal moments, and so it is free of the geometric error and highly robust to the numerical integration error. Experimental results indicate that the proposed moments perform better in image reconstruction and pattern classification, and yield higher tolerance to image noise and smooth distortion in comparison with the existing circularly orthogonal moments.

"The integrity verification of on-chip flash memory data as code memory is becoming important in microcontroller-based applications such as automotive systems. On-the-fly memory fail-detection requires a fast detection method in the seamless background mode without any interruption of CPU operation and low-power flash access hardware to provide safety-conscious execution of the user-programmed firmware during system operations. In this paper, newly-designed read-path architecture based on the binary inversion techniques is proposed for on-chip flash-embedded microcontrollers. The proposed binary inversion method also enables fail-safe, low-power memory access with zero hardware overhead by embedding the scramble flags on the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) protection code. Time-multiplexed CRC calculation for bit-inversion binary code is automatically executed with the silent background mode during CPU idle time without any CPU wait cost. The implementation result shows that the de-inversion procedure could be achieved with just an additional 1,024 bits CRC data in the case of 64 sectors for 4 KB flash memory by reducing 75% of the area of the previous work. The code memory integrity verification time in the seamless background mode is about 30% of the conventional foreground method. The total average current during the code execution for Dhrys tone (TM) benchmark uses just 15% of the basement.",51
"Accumulating evidence from brain structural imaging studies has supported that chronic pain could induce changes in brain gray matter volume. However, few studies have focused on the gray matter alterations of Trigeminal neuralgia (TN). In this study, twenty-eight TN patients (thirteen females; mean age, 45.86 years +/- 11.17) and 28 healthy controls (HC; thirteen females; mean age, 44.89 years +/- 7.67) were included. Using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), we detected abnormalities in gray matter volume in the TN patients. Based on a voxel-wise analysis, the TN group showed significantly decreased gray matter volume in the bilateral superior/middle temporal gyrus (STG/MTG), bilateral parahippocampus, left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), caudate nucleus, right fusiform gyrus, and right cerebellum compared with the HC. In addition, we found that the gray matter volume in the bilateral STG/MTG was negatively correlated with the duration of TN. These results provide compelling evidence for gray matter abnormalities in TN and suggest that the duration of TN may be a critical factor associated with brain alterations.",10
"Among available tools for estimating the ecological impacts of discharge alteration, hydraulic habitat models link hydraulic models of streams with biological models that reflect the preferences of organisms for hydraulics. The simplification of habitat models now enables their application at the catchment scale for estimating the impacts on habitats of discharge and abstraction management. In the Seine-Normandie catchment in France, we propose an original linkage of a distributed hydrological model, a fish species distribution model and hydraulic habitat models. We show that groundwater abstraction in the catchment cause a moderate alteration of low flows (median: 4.1%) and a weak alteration of usable habitats for fish (median: 1.6%). However, the spatial distribution of alterations helps to identify regions where impacts are stronger (habitat alteration around 15%), due to strong abstraction and/or the presence of demanding fish species. An uncertainty analysis indicates that our results should be interpreted at the regional scale only; they allow identifying regions that would deserve more detailed analyses. Our results open many perspectives for taking into account habitat issues in quantitative water management at the catchment scale.",83
"Background: Health and Physical Education (HPE) teachers are known to be under social-, personal-, and employment-related pressure to be and appear physically fit, and to use dangerous dieting and weight control practices. This is problematic due to the influence this may have on their own health and the potential to model these attitudes and behaviours to their future students. Methods: In this paper, we compare the body image, dieting, disordered eating, and exercise behaviours of first year, HPE, and non-HPE, teacher education students. Participants were 596 first-year university student pre-service teachers (n = 249 HPE and n = 347 non-HPE) from three universities in Australia who completed self-report questionnaires. Analysis of covariance and logistic regression analyses were used to determine differences in attitudes and behaviours between these two groups for males and females separately. Results: We found that male HPE participants had significantly higher levels of drive for muscularity and obligatory exercise, and were more likely to be classified as having an exercise disorder, dieting, and using steroids than non-HPE students were. Female HPE students were more likely to engage in self-reported excessive exercise, to have higher scores on the Obligatory Exercise Questionnaire, and be classified as having an exercise disorder. Conclusion: These findings are important as they confirm the presence of dieting and disordered eating attitudes and behaviours among all teacher education students, and highlight male HPE teachers as a potentially vulnerable group. These results may inform the implementation of intervention programs for teacher education students to ensure their personal wellbeing and professional capacity in promoting positive body image, nutrition, and physical activity among young people.",67
"Ovarian protection from chemotoxicity is essential for reproductive health. Our objective is to determine the role of ATP-dependent, Multidrug Resistance Transporters (MDRs) in this protection. Previously we identified MDR-dependent cytoprotection from cyclophosphamide in mouse and human oocytes by use of MDR inhibitors. Here we use genetic deletions in MDR1a/b/BCRP of mice to test MDR function in ovarian somatic cells and find that mdr1a/b/bcrp-/- mice had significantly increased sensitivity to cyclophosphamide. Further, estrus cyclicity and follicle distribution in mdrl a/b/bcrp-/- mice also differed from age-matched wildtype ovaries. We found that MDR gene activity cycles through estrus and that MDR-1b cyclicity correlated with 17 beta-estradiol surges. We also examined the metabolite composition of the ovary and learned that the mdrl alb/bcrp-/- mice have increased accumulation of metabolites indicative of oxidative stress and inflammation. We conclude that MDRs are essential to ovarian protection from chemotoxicity and may have an important physiological role in the ovary. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",23
"Identification of nonlinear structural system is an important but challenging task for structural health monitoring. Due to the complexities of structural nonlinearities, it is hard to establish proper mathematical models for some structural nonlinear behaviors. Moreover, only partial structural responses can be measured in practice; it is essential to conduct identification of nonlinear structural systems using only partial measurements of structural responses. To cope with these issues, an algorithm is proposed in this article for the identification of some model-free structural nonlinear restoring forces using only partial measurements of structural responses. First, an equivalent linear structural system is introduced for the identification of the locations of structural nonlinearities. Then, a model-free structural nonlinear restoring force is approximated by a power series polynomial. The unknown coefficients of the power series polynomials together with other structural parameters are identified by the extended Kalman filter so that the characteristics of the behaviors of the model-free of nonlinear restoring forces can be identified. Some numerical examples including the identification of two nonlinear multi-story shear frames and a planar nonlinear truss with different structural nonlinear restoring forces are used to validate the proposed algorithm.",49
"Due to the manifold effects of thyroid hormone across virtually all organ systems, the complications associated with thyroid dysfunction are numerous and diverse. The stresses encountered during the perioperative period may exacerbate underlying thyroid disorders, potentially precipitating decompensation and even death. Thus, it is of the utmost importance for the clinician to comprehend the mechanisms by which thyroid disease may complicate surgery and postoperative recovery and to be cognizant of the most effective means of optimizing the status of thyrotoxic and hypothyroid patients perioperatively. This article describes the adverse effects of thyroid dysfunction as they relate to the patient undergoing both thyroid and nonthyroid surgery and recommends treatment approaches aimed at decreasing perioperative risk.",133
"This study presents a hierarchical distributed structure based on the Holonic concept for reactive power control in smart grids. Holons, as the main parts of the proposed framework, are able to negotiate together, change their boundaries, and alter the role of their members. These abilities improve the flexibility and performance of the novel structure in order to adapt itself to different situations. The proposed methodology is successfully scrutinised through different case studies based on a transmission test system connected to seven distribution networks. The new method is compared with two structures using a set of evaluation indices. The simulation results have revealed that improving the computational efficiency, minimising the active power losses and voltage deviations, optimal utilisation of reactive power sources, less data traffic loads, and increasing the fault tolerance are some key features of the proposed approach.",55
"This study aimed at characterizing the fatty acid (FA) composition of red blood cell (RBC) phospholipids in children and adolescents with primary hyperlipidemia, and to ascertain potential association with serum lipid profile and dietary factors. At this purpose, 54 probands aged 6-17 years were recruited. Subjects showed a low omega-3 index (eicosapentaenoic acid, EPA+docosahexaenoic acid, DHA < 4%). Compared to males, females had a trend toward lower levels of total monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and MUFA/saturated fatty acids (SFAs) ratio in RBCs. An inverse relationship between MUFA concentration in RBCs and serum cholesterol or HDL-C/triglycerides ratio was found. Omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6 PUFA) were positively associated to serum HDL-C levels, and inversely to dietary cholesterol. Fiber intake was positively associated with MUFA/SFA ratio. In conclusion, we provide the first experimental data on phospholipid FA composition of RBCs in hyperlipidemic children, showing sex differences and an overall low omega 3-index.",129
"Smart grid integrates electrical network, communication systems and information technologies, where increasing architecture interdependency is introducing new challenges in the evaluation of how possible threats could affect security and reliability of power system. While cyber-attacks have been widely studied, consequences of physical failures on real-time applications are starting to receive attention due to implications for power system security. This paper presents a methodology to quantify the impact on observability in state estimation of possible disruptive failures of a common transmission infrastructure. Numerical results are obtained by calculating observability indicators on an IEEE 14-bus test case, considering the simultaneous disconnection of power transmission lines and communication links installed on the same infrastructure.",50
"Background: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA), an inflammatory musculoskeletal disease, develops in approximately 30% of patients with psoriasis. Previously, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (CXCL10) was identified as a predictive biomarker of PsA in patients with psoriasis and was reduced after development of PsA. The purpose of the present study was to explore messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression of CXCL10 and its receptor, chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 3 (CXCR3), in the joints of patients with PsA to gain insight into their role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Methods: Sera from 47 patients with PsA and 33 healthy control subjects were compared for expression of CXCL10 by Luminex assay. Synovial fluid (SF) was obtained from patients with PsA (n = 40), osteoarthritis (OA; n = 14), gout (n = 8), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA; n = 11) during clinical care. SF mRNA and protein expression of CXCL10, interleukin-17A (IL-17A), CXCR3, TBX21, RORC and/or interferon. (IFN gamma) were compared among the above-mentioned disease groups, as well as in paired SF and serum samples from patients with PsA using real-time polymerase chain reaction and Luminex assays, respectively. Results: Serum CXCL10 was significantly higher in patients with PsA than in control subjects (p = 0.0007). CXCL10, IL-17A, and TBX21 expression were elevated in SF cells of patients with PsA compared with those of patients with OA and gout, but not those of patients with RA. CXCR3 and RORC were elevated in PsA SF cells compared with all other patient groups. Concordant results were obtained for CXCL10 and IL-17A protein expression. IFN gamma was elevated in PsA SF compared with OA SF (p = 0.015). CXCL10 protein expression was substantially increased in SF (median 7283.9 pg/ml, interquartile range [IQR] 1330-10,362 pg/ml) compared with paired serum samples (median 282.06, IQR 180.7-395.8 pg/ml; p = 0.001), whereas IFN gamma was significantly reduced (SF median 6.03 pg/ml, IQR 4.47-8.94 pg/ml; versus serum median 23.70 pg/ml, IQR 3.2-104.6 pg/ml; p = 0.001). Conclusions: CXCL10 may have an important etiological role in PsA that is analogous to that in RA, and it is a candidate biomarker to distinguish PsA from healthy individuals and from patients with OA and gout.",22
"Equal access for autism services remains suboptimal for diverse groups. In Canada, little is known about the barriers immigrant mothers face accessing services and support for their children with developmental disabilities. In this qualitative study, 21 immigrant mothers of children with Autism, from a diverse ethno cultural background, were interviewed in Toronto, Canada. We apply House's (1981) four domains of social support to analyze findings. Structural support challenges, such as delays in diagnosis, fragmented and dispersed services were common, followed by instrumental challenges due to loss of social ties and stigma. Lack of expected support from partners, and negative perceptions of services, were identified as emotional and perceptive challenges. Focused attention is required to address inequalities within the context of current access pathways for autism.",113
"This paper seeks to investigate the postporgraphic production of the Colombian artist Nadia Granados, who through his character La Fulminante explores (and exploits) stereotypical representation of sexually provocative Latino women in order to generate libertarian artisticinterventions in public space. Their performances are powerful critics about normative gender roles, but also about violence against female bodies. At the same time, her work allows us to think about the possibility of recovering the autonomy of feminized bodies through pleasure and sexuality. The theoretical contributions that I will use to analyze the work of this Colombian artist are the studies of performance and decolonial feminism. Finally, it is important to inscribe Granados's work as part of the history of feminist art, where the performing arts have been explored by women artists to visualize not only the violence that passes through our bodies, but also the possibility of leakage and resistance in terms of gender and sexualities.",77
"We analyse people's attitudes to robots to be used in caring for the elderly using Eurobarometer data relating to November/December 2014 on approximately 1000 people in each EU country. Given the constraints on public expenditure this is one solution to meeting increased obligations in this area. People tend to be lukewarm to robotic care for the elderly. However, a simple average hides the fact that many people, young and old, are totally hostile to the concept and a smaller number totally in favour. Consistent with the literature we find the young to be more in favour of this option than the elderly themselves. There are other differences with males, those in cities and the more educated being more in favour as well as differences between countries. Thus in three French speaking countries there is relatively little evidence of differences in attitudes between young and old. These differences between different groups of people are found to widen with age, which represents a new finding in the literature.",119
"In this paper, a thermally actuated medical stent and staple using shape memory alloy (SMA) are designed, numerically analysed, and compared to similarly designed stents and staples made of 316L stainless steel and Co-Cr alloy. The numerical analysis was carried out using finite element method. A consistent 3D model is used to investigate the effect of materials on the performance of the stent and staple. This study takes into account the interaction between the stent/staple and the in vivo environment, by modelling the in vivo environment forces. The results are in good agreement with those reported in the literature. According to the results, it can be concluded that when these three commercially available materials undergo an external force, SMA yields much better results in terms of maximum displacement under the same amount of stress. Especially when undergoing large loads, the SMA produces considerably more displacement than 316L stainless steel and Co-Cr, which suggests that using SMA is a promising path to make biomedical stents and staples.",103
A comment on Field's critique of the present author's paper ''Einstein's Relativistic Time-Dilation: A Critical Analysis and a Suggested Experiment'' is given. The comment reasserts that the muon g - 2 experiments do not give convincing direct evidence for relativistic time dilation with high precision as claimed. The comment emphasizes again that convincing tests of predictions of special relativity must not presume the validity of special relativity.,44
"Proline accumulation is involved in plant osmotic stress tolerance. Given that DNA methylation is related to almost all metabolic processes through regulation of gene expression, we suspected that this epigenetic modification and proline biosynthesis are probably related. To test this, we investigated whether osmotic stress-induced proline accumulation is associated with DNA methylation modifications in rice. We assessed DNA methylation and expression of 3 key genes (P5CR, P5CS, and delta-OAT) involved in proline biosynthesis, and measured proline content under both osmotic stress (15% polyethylene glycol) and control conditions. After osmotic stress, selfed progenies of osmotic-stressed plants accumulated higher concentrations of proline in leaves under both normal conditions and under osmotic stress than the unstressed control plants. Concomitantly, under osmotic stress, the selfed progeny plants showed higher expression levels of P5CS and d-OAT than the control. This up-regulated expression was stably inherited by the subsequent generation. Methylation-sensitive Southern blotting indicated that 2 of the 3 genes, P5CS and delta-OAT, had greater DNA demethylation in the selfed progenies than in the control. Apparently DNA demethylation facilitated proline accumulation by up-regulating expression of the P5CS and delta-OAT genes in response to osmotic stress.",39
"In pre-surgery decisions in hospital emergency cases, fast and reliable results of the solid and fluid mechanics problems are of great interest to clinicians. In the current investigation, an iterative process based on a pressure-type boundary condition is proposed in order to reduce the computational costs of blood flow simulations in arteries, without losing control of the important clinical parameters. The incorporation of cardiovascular autoregulation, together with the well-known impedance boundary condition, forms the basis of the proposed methodology. With autoregulation, the instabilities associated with conventional pressure-type or impedance boundary conditions are avoided without an excessive increase in computational costs. The general behaviour of pulsatile blood flow in arteries, which is important from the clinical point of view, is well reproduced through this new methodology. In addition, the interaction between the blood and the arterial walls occurs via a modified weak coupling, which makes the simulation more stable and computationally efficient. Based on in vitro experiments, the hyperelastic behaviour of the wall is characterised and modelled. The applications and benefits of the proposed pressure-type boundary condition are shown in a model of an idealised aortic arch with and without an ascending aorta dissection, which is a common cardiovascular disorder.",86
"This article describes a creative design activity to introduce engineering students to mechatronic prototyping. Our goal was to find a creative task to increase student confidence and skills in mechanical design, electrical circuits, microcontrollers, and programming. We present the Paper Robot exercise, a design activity that blends everyday materials such as cardboard, with electronic components. This activity was introduced during the 2010-2011 academic year and has been repeated every year since, in a global, industry-sponsored design course at Stanford University. The Paper Robot exercise resulted from the observation that students were intimidated to create functional prototypes with microcontrollers. The teaching team needed a way to quickly introduce tools for programming electronic components and to encourage creative experimentation early in the course. Results include a 100% task performance rate of students that successfully made a robot meeting the minimum requirements. 76% of students reported an increase in knowledge in programming microcontrollers (Arduino), and 69% increased their knowledge in creating electronic circuits out of raw components. This activity may be modified to introduce younger students to mechatronic platforms in STEM education curriculum.",45
"Nowadays, electronic throttle control system is widely adapted in the motorcycle for better drivability, fuel economy and reduces the emissions. In such systems, pedal follower or torque based approach are used for calculating the required throttle angle for the given torque demand by driver. This work presents a throttle control system for the precise estimation of throttle angle based on the integrated pedal follower and torque based approach for the given accelerator position and torque demand by the driver. A mathematical model for an electronic throttle body is developed to understand the effects of nonlinearities due to friction and limp home dual springs. A PID controller with compensators are developed to handle the nonlinearities due to the friction and limp home dual springs in the proposed electronic throttle control system. A simulation study has been carried out using software in loop and hardware in loop simulation approaches for step, sinusoidal, and ramp input signals. The responses of electronic throttle body for opening the throttle angle and error are analyzed for the given input signals. The simulation result shows that the proposed compensators has significant advantage in reducing the throttle angle error and gives the desired output.",59
"The assessment of off-grid electrification programs in developing countries largely based on mini-grid and solar home system (SHS) has shown that they are faced with low development imparts and sustainability challenges, which has resulted in failure of many projects. This study provides solutions on how to surmount these challenges, leaning on the experience of a hybrid solar-diesel mini-grid at Tsumkwe village in Namibia. It provides analyses of a case study based on empirical evidence from field studies, interviews of representatives of households, public institutions and energy providers. In addition, it investigates the technical challenges and economic impacts of the electrification program. HOMER (TM) and MATLAB (TM) models were used in the analysis and investigations. The findings show that despite the challenges, the system has been sustained because it keyed into an existing structure with growth potentials. The progressive tariff system adopted by the government helped to cushion costs and allow low income households in the energy matrix. Adoption of strict maintenance measures, and implementation of energy efficiency measures prior to the commissioning of the program, resulted in the reduction of costs. The success elements identified in this study could be extrapolated in other sub-Saharan African countries if the challenges are properly addressed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",43
"Akinesia, hypokinesia, and bradykinesia are extensively used to describe motor execution disturbances, but are applied inconsistently and cover more conditions than their Greek translations would suggest. We investigated the origins and changes in meaning of these terms over time, particularly in relation to Parkinson's disease (PD). We searched the literature from 1817 to 2015 for use and interpretation of the words akinesia, bradykinesia, hypokinesia, and PD. We found that akinesia and hypokinesia appeared as terms in the 19th century, opposite to hyperkinesia, but were used in the context of PD since 1920, while at the same time the 'bradykinetic syndrome' was introduced. Use of all terms increased in this period due to the encephalitis-lethargica-epidemic, and increased again with the discovery of levodopa from 1961. With the extensive use of criteria sets from the 1980s, bradykinesia replaced akinesia as the most commonly used term. The advent of the internet led to an increase in publications and an associated increase in heterogeneity in the use of the terms. This review shows the variation over time and the lack of unity in the terminology used to describe the range of movement execution disturbances. The current terminology fails to capture the nuances of the challenges we face in documenting these disturbances. We therefore recommend that the current situation may benefit from an objective and computationally solid approach using insights from network and circuitry technology and new developments in assessment technology. It is expected that this will contribute to a new framework for terminology in movement disorders. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",19
"Most of the well-known supervised dimensionality reduction methods assume unimodal or Gaussian like-lihoods, which may not be appropriate in the real life applications. In this manuscript, we introduce a novel supervised dimensionality reduction approach, moments discriminant analysis, which models linear relationships between the high-dimensional input space and a low-dimensional space by maximizing the discrimination between second order raw moments of different classes to improve the generalization capability of a classifier. Unlike the state-of-the-art methods, moments discriminant analysis is intended to accommodate data distributions that may be multimodal and non-Gaussian. Initially, experiments using synthetic random data (generated from different probability distributions) are performed to prove the efficiency of the proposed method for multimodal and non-Gaussian data with the help of five separability measures. Also, extensive experimental results on UCI machine learning repository and image retrieval on WANG and MIT (Oliva and Torralba) databases are carried out in order to exhibit the effectiveness of moments discriminant analysis over the state-of-the-art methods.",1
"To determine whether the encoding of misleading information presented in two different types of leading questions (closed specific and open presumptive questions) could be disrupted, participants took part in a misinformation experiment. They viewed an event before answering questions that had a closed specific structure (e.g. ""Did the robber have a shotgun that had a black barrel and a brown stock?"") or an open presumptive structure (e.g. ""Tell me about the shotgun""). Half the questions contained misleading information and half did not. For some of the questions, participants completed a concurrent distractor task. Finally, they completed a recognition memory test about the original event. Results showed that the concurrent distractor task during the interview reduced the size of the misinformation effect for the closed specific questions, but had no impact on the misinformation effect for the open presumptive questions. The results suggest that open presumptive questions encourage participants to encode and process the misleading information more deeply than the closed specific questions. The misinformation effect was more difficult to disrupt with a concurrent task during the encoding of the misleading information for open presumptive questions than for closed specific questions. The implications for interviewing are discussed.",78
"In this paper we present a simple mathematical model of cancer growth. The model is discrete, it is a linear map (T) on three dimensional Eucledian vector space. But for some values of the parameters there exists a linear vector field on three dimensional Eucledian vector space whose time one map is T. We can analyze what happens to the flow of this vector field on one of the coordinate hyperplanes (see Fig. 5 in Sect. 4). In words this figure depicts, that if you have a bad ratio of growth inhibitor to growth factor cancer grows and if you have a good ratio cancer is eradicated. We can modify the dynamical system to model giving chemo therapy or immune therapy and discuss the consequences. We fit the model predictions to a Gompertz function and this gives a good fit for some values of the parameters (see Figs. 1, 2, 3 and 4). A main topic of the present paper is a mass action kinetic model for cancer growth. This gives a three dimensional ODE model, for which the first orthant is positively invariant. We discretize the linearization of this nonlinear ODE and with appropriate parameter definitions we recover the model T of Sect. 1. For some parameter values the model T induces a two dimensional map of the plane, see Sect. 5 .",33
"Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) is a promising Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) drug target. DPP-IV inhibitors prolong the action of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), improve glucose homeostasis without weight gain, edema, and hypoglycemia. However, the marketed DPP-IV inhibitors have adverse effects such as nasopharyngitis, headache, nausea, hypersensitivity, skin reactions and pancreatitis. Therefore, it is still expected for novel DPP-IV inhibitors with minimal adverse effects. The scaffolds of existing DPP-IV inhibitors are structurally diversified. This makes it difficult to build virtual screening models based upon the known DPP-IV inhibitor libraries using conventional QSAR approaches. In this paper, we report a new strategy to predict DPP-IV inhibitors with machine learning approaches involving naive Bayesian (NB) and recursive partitioning (RP) methods. We built 247 machine learning models based on 1307 known DPP-IV inhibitors with optimized molecular properties and topological fingerprints as descriptors. The overall predictive accuracies of the optimized models were greater than 80%. An external test set, composed of 65 recently reported compounds, was employed to validate the optimized models. The results demonstrated that both NB and RP models have a good predictive ability based on different combinations of descriptors. Twenty ""good"" and twenty ""bad"" structural fragments for DPP-IV inhibitors can also be derived from these models for inspiring the new DPP-IV inhibitor scaffold design.",1
"Those with borderline personality disorder (BPD) display altered evaluations regarding reward and punishment compared to others. The processing of rewards is basal for operant conditioning. However, studies addressing operant conditioning in BPD patients are rare. In the current study, an operant conditioning task combining learning acquisition and reversal was used. BPD patients and matched healthy controls (HCs) were exposed to aversive and neutral stimuli to assess the influence of emotion on learning. Picture content, dissociation, aversive tension and symptom severity were rated. Error rates were measured. Results showed no group interactions between aversive versus neutral scenes. The higher emotional arousal, dissociation and tension, the worse the acquisition, but riot reversal, scores were for BPD patients. Scores from the Borderline Symptom List were associated with more errors in the reversal, but not the acquisition phase. The results are preliminary evidence for impaired acquisition learning due to increased emotional arousal, dissociation and tension in BPD patients. A failure to process punishment in the reversal phase was associated with symptom severity and may be related to neuropsychological dysfunctioning involving the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Conclusions are limited due to the correlational study design and the small sample size. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",70
"Purpose Headache is a common presenting feature of patients with pituitary adenomas and other tumors of the sellar region. However, at present, it still is unclear whether the headache is actually caused by the tumor. To explore whether there is a relation, we examined in detail the headache types, their relationship to the underlying pathology, and if the headache responded to neurosurgery in a prospective study design. Methods One hundred twelve patients with tumors of the sellar region scheduled for neurosurgery in a single center were analyzed for presence and quality of headache before surgery and at least 3 months after surgery. Patients received headache and depression self-rating inventories, presented on a handheld computer (PainDetect(A (R))). Clinical variables thought to impact on headache were analyzed in conjunction with the inventories. Results Fifty-nine (53%) patients reported headache in the 3 months prior to neurosurgery, 49 (44%) had headache at the time of filling in the questionnaires. The four patients with pituitary apoplexy described thunderclap headache. In the other patients diverse headache types were encountered, most frequently migraine. Untreated gonadotroph deficiency was significantly associated with absence of headache, while none of the other clinical and morphological variables related to headache. Presence of headache and disability due to headache were not significantly reduced after surgery. Conclusion Apart from pituitary apoplexy we detected no specific headache type in our patient group and no significant improvement of headache after neurosurgery. Headache alone constitutes neither a valid diagnostic marker for the presence of tumors of the sellar region nor a sufficient indication for tumor removal.",69
"Background and aims: While the association between health anxiety and maladaptive Internet use is a well-established finding, no studies have been performed to examine the possible effect of abnormal illness behavior (AIB). AIB is a maladaptive manner of experiencing, evaluating, or acting in response to health and illness that is disproportionate to evident pathology. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between AIB and Internet addiction (IA) severity in a sample of Italian University students. The possible effect of alexithymia, anxiety, and depression was also taken into account. Methods: Participants were 115 men and 163 women (mean age = 23.62 +/- 4.38 years); AIB was measured via the Illness Behavior Questionnaire (IBQ), and IA severity by the Internet Addiction Test (IAT). Results: The most powerful IBQ factor predicting IA severity scores was disease conviction. Irritability was the only emotional IBQ factor associated with IA severity. Nevertheless, disease conviction and alexithymia remained the only significant predictors of IAT scores when hierarchical regression analysis was executed. Discussion and conclusions: Our results support previous findings showing that those characterized by health anxiety are more prone to an excessive and maladaptive use of Internet. Moreover, this study showed that irritability was the only emotional aspect of AIB predicting IA severity. This finding is consistent with the cognitive model of hypochondria, which states that cognitive factors (dysfunctional beliefs and assumptions) play a major role in the explanation of this psychopathological condition.",104
"Background: Data from biological samples and medical evaluations plays an essential part in clinical decision making. This data is equally important in clinical studies and it is critical to have an infrastructure that ensures that its quality is preserved throughout its entire lifetime. We are running a 5-year longitudinal clinical study, KOL-Orestad, with the objective to identify new COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) biomarkers in blood. In the study, clinical data and blood samples are collected from both private and public health-care institutions and stored at our research center in databases and biobanks, respectively. The blood is analyzed by Mass Spectrometry and the results from this analysis then linked to the clinical data. Method: We built an infrastructure that allows us to efficiently collect and analyze the data. We chose to use REDCap as the EDC (Electronic Data Capture) tool for the study due to its short setup-time, ease of use, and flexibility. REDCap allows users to easily design data collection modules based on existing templates. In addition, it provides two functions that allow users to import batches of data; through a web API (Application Programming Interface) as well as by uploading CSV-files (Comma Separated Values). Results: We created a software, DART (Data Rapid Translation), that translates our biomarker data into a format that fits REDCap's CSV-templates. In addition, DART is configurable to work with many other data formats as well. We use DART to import our clinical chemistry data to the REDCap database. Conclusion: We have shown that a powerful and internationally adopted EDC tool such as REDCap can be extended so that it can be used efficiently in proteomic studies. In our study, we accomplish this by using DART to translate our clinical chemistry data to a format that fits the templates of REDCap.",42
"In recent years, the development of high techniques in the field of computer graphics, computer vision and images processing has been widely studied and applied in geometric modeling. Especially, in the field of 3D modeling and reconstruction of a 3D object from 2D images. One of these researches is the field of medical image processing. It has been invested and developed by researchers, both in computer science and medicine. This paper presents a survey research on construction and reconstruction of a 3D object from a set of 2D medical images. We first review the existing methods for building a 3D object from 2D medical image slices in DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) format. They come from measurement devices in medicine like X-ray Computerized Tomography (X-ray CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), etc. Thereafter, we construct an application based on the VTK library for building, visualizing and handling a 3D object from these CT scanned slices. This application can support medical staffs and doctors in diagnostic and treatment of patients.",79
"microRNAs (miRs) have been investigated as a novel class of regulators of cellular processes, including proliferation, apoptosis and metabolism. In particular, miR-30b has been demonstrated to be deregulated in certain types of cancer, including lung, colorectal and gastric cancer. Previous studies of miR-30b in renal clear cell carcinoma demonstrated that the expression level of miR-30b was associated with distant metastasis. However, the function of miR-30b in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remained to be elucidated. In the present study, the expression of miR-30b in 31 paired RCC tissues from four cell lines (786-O, 769-P, ACHN and 293T) was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In addition, the effect of miR-30b on cell proliferation in RCC cells was also determined using MTT and Cell Counting Kit-8 assay analyses. Furthermore, the function of miR-30b in cell migration and invasion was determined by wound scratch and Transwell assays. Flow cytometry was also performed to quantify the effect of miR-30b on cell apoptosis. The results of the current study indicated that miR-30b was upregulated in RCC tissues from affected cell lines when compared with adjacent normal tissues and a normal kidney cell line, which is different to the downregulation of miR-30b as observed in other types of cancer. miR-30b is associated with RCC cell proliferation, invasion, migration and apoptosis, which indicated that miR-30b acts as an oncogene in RCC. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate the upregulation of miR-30b in RCC tissues and describe miR-30b as an oncogene in RCC in the regulation of cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis. Further studies will define the target gene of miR-30b in RCC and investigate the potential role of miR-30b as a biomarker for RCC.",37
"This contribution investigates the social distance of immigrants from Poland in four Western European cities - London, Birmingham, Berlin and Munich - particularly Polish immigrants' distance towards members of ethnic, religious and sexual minorities in their various social roles. Presenting unique data from the first wave of a longitudinal qualitative study, we first discuss the differential levels of social distance that Polish immigrants place between themselves and members of minority groups in each city. We find that respondents' socio-demographic characteristics impact their social distance, but their education and occupation may have less of an effect than their place of origin in Poland or current place of residence and work. Moreover, these factors work differentially across the four cities. After analysing social distance with respect to three dimensions of difference - ethnicity, religion and sexuality - we find several different social-distancing mechanisms. Ultimately, we argue that social science needs to consider regional and local contexts in which social attitudes towards minorities are acquired and exercised. Similarly, we need to reflect on the group's presumed homogeneity and on the unifying visions of the host society' as a site of migrants' incorporation.",61
"Although traditional economic models posit that money is fungible, psychological research abounds with examples that deviate from this assumption. Across eight experiments, we provide evidence that people construe physical currency as carrying traces of its moral history. In Experiments 1 and 2, people report being less likely to want money with negative moral history (i.e., stolen money). Experiments 3-5 provide evidence against an alternative account that people's judgments merely reflect beliefs about the consequences of accepting stolen money rather than moral sensitivity. Experiment 6 examines whether an aversion to stolen money may reflect contamination concerns, and Experiment 7 indicates that people report they would donate stolen money, thereby counteracting its negative history with a positive act. Finally, Experiment 8 demonstrates that, even in their recall of actual events, people report a reduced tendency to accept tainted money. Altogether, these findings suggest a robust tendency to evaluate money based on its moral history, even though it is designed to participate in exchanges that effectively erase its origins.",62
"Purpose - This paper aims to contribute to entrepreneurship theorising by highlighting the salience of feminine caring positions in creating novel entrepreneurial roles and investigating how these roles contribute to community resilience. Using a critical feminist economics lens, alternative conceptualisations of the economy are expanded upon to reveal how an economic externality influences entrepreneurial discourse, gender roles and community resilience. Design/methodology/approach - In this interpretive approach, empirical evidence is drawn from six months of intensive ethnographic research with 20 tourism handicraft micro-entrepreneurs in Crete and Epirus, Greece, in 2012 and hence in the context of a macroeconomic crisis. Ethnographic interviewing and participant observation are used as the methods to achieve the research objectives. Findings - Thematic analysis is used to investigate how gender roles and entrepreneurial roles interact and how this interaction influences community resilience to an economic crisis. Using the critical theory to critique neoclassical economics interpretations of entrepreneurship, it becomes evident that politico-economic structures perpetuating feminised responsibility for social reproduction configure feminine entrepreneurial roles, and these roles have a positive effect on increasing community resilience. By conceptualising entrepreneurial involvement as being primarily for community gain, participants highlight how feminine entrepreneurial discourse differs from the neoclassical economics entrepreneurial discourse of entrepreneurial involvement being primarily for individual gain. Social implications - This paper contributes to theoretical advancements on the role of gender in entrepreneurship and community resilience by investigating the entrepreneurs' gendered responses to an exogenous shock. Providing insight into the role gender has in entrepreneurial adaptation and sustainable business practices means that new policies to combat social exclusion and promote rural development can be formulated. Originality/value - The theoretical interplay between gender and entrepreneurship is investigated from a novel angle, that of critical feminist economics. The relationship between feminised interpretations of entrepreneurship and community resilience is brought to light, providing a unique insight into entrepreneurial resilience.",77
"Pine tar is the end product of pine wood carbonisation following distillation using extreme heat. An extensive literature search was conducted back to the 1950s for this review. Pine tar has been used in medicine for more than 2000 years to treat a range of skin conditions because of its soothing and antiseptic properties. Pine tar should not be confused with coal tar, which has been produced from coal for approximately a hundred years. Pine tar is thought to exert its effect by reducing DNA synthesis and mitotic activity, which promotes a return to normal keratinisation. In addition, pine tar has been shown to be antipruritic, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antifungal. These properties make pine tar suitable for the topical treatment of eczema, psoriasis, seborrhoeic dermatitis and other dry, itchy, flaky or inflamed skin conditions. Topical products available over-the-counter in Australia today contain up to 2.3% pine tar, and come in several different formulations that can be used on the entire body, including the face. Modern day pine tar is manufactured with increased purity to eliminate toxic phenol and carcinogenic components, which have been of concern in the past. Primary irritation is uncommon. In conclusion, the long experience with topical pine tar therapy and its worldwide usage, together with the evidence presented in this review, suggests that pine tar is an effective treatment with minimal safety risk.",21
"A nonrelational, distributed computing, data warehouse, and analytics environment (Energy-CRADLE) was developed for the analysis of field and laboratory data from multiple heterogeneous photovoltaic (PV) test sites. This data informatics and analytics infrastructure was designed to process diverse formats of PV performance data and climatic telemetry time-series data collected from a PV outdoor test network, i.e., the Solar Durability and Lifetime Extension global SunFarm network, as well as point-in-time laboratory spectral and image measurements of PV material samples. Using Hadoop/HBase for the distributed data warehouse, Energy-CRADLE does not have a predefined data table schema, which enables ingestion of data in diverse and changing formats. For easy data ingestion and data retrieval, Energy-CRADLE utilizes Hadoop streaming to enable Python MapReduce and provides a graphical user interface, i.e., py-CRADLE. By developing the Hadoop distributed computing platform and the HBase NoSQL database schema for solar energy, Energy-CRADLE exemplifies an integrated, scalable, secure, and user-friendly data informatics and analytics system for PV researchers. An example of Energy-CRADLE enabled scalable, data-driven, analytics is presented, where machine learning is used for anomaly detection across 2.2 million real-world current-voltage (I-V) curves of PV modules in three distinct Koppen-Geiger climatic zones.",2
"The impact of presidential debates on candidate evaluations remains an open topic. Research has long sought to identify the factors that matter most in citizens' responses to debate content, including what candidates say, how they say it, and the manner in which they appear. This study uses detailed codings of the first and third 2012 presidential debates to evaluate the impact of candidates' verbal and nonverbal behaviors on viewers' second screen responsetheir use of computers, tablets, and mobile devices to express their reactions to the viewing experience. To examine the relationship between candidates' on-screen behaviors and the social media response, we conduct generalized least squares regression (Prais-Winstein estimation) relating two data sources: (a) a shot-by-shot content analysis coded for rhetorical/functional, tonal, and visual elements of both candidates' behavior during the debates, and (b) corresponding real-time measures of the volume and valence of online expression about the candidates on Twitter. We find that the nonverbal communication behaviors of candidatestheir facial expressions, physical gestures, and blink rateare consistent, robust, and significant predictors of the volume and valence of public expression during debates, rivaling the power of memes generated by candidates and contributing more than rhetorical strategies and speech tone.",64
"In this paper, a new light weight highly secured ciphering engine creation methodology we called On Demand Ciphering Engine (ODCE) was suggested. The main feature of this method is that both, the ciphering engine and the secret key, are kept secrets and created by the user or the system administrator when initiating his transmission, then the involved sides exchange these secrets. The design methodology and structure of this system was described and prototyped using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as the main building block in the system. Software and hardware implementations of the suggested system were performed to prove its practicability. Also, different experimental tests were achieved to determine the impact of the suggested method on both network delay and system performance.",46
"This article proposes a multiobjective optimization model for the design of a macroscopic water system of a Mexican city that solves simultaneously the planning and scheduling of water storage and distribution tasks. The model, which considers rainwater harvesting and reclaimed water reusing as alternative water sources, maximizes the revenues from water sales and minimizes simultaneously the water consumption and land use. A case study based on the city of Morelia in Mexico was solved. It was found that the use of alternative water sources (such as harvested rainwater) along with an appropriate planning and scheduling of storage and distribution tasks have the potential to reduce the pressure over natural reservoirs significantly. Our approach considers simultaneously economic and environmental concerns, thereby contributing to the implementation of more sustainable alternatives in urban water distribution.

"Reliability is a significant performance index for any electrical equipment in the industry, especially for electric motor driven (EMD) systems. Modelling the reliability of an EMD system is a difficult and challenging task. However, based on field data, the dominant failure modes of some motor system parts can be used to develop a simple and credible reliability model. This study proposes a failure rate prediction model for an EMD system that is currently in use in hydrocarbon industries. In addition, a fault tree model was designed to identify the root causes of the failures and the failure mechanism of the most dominates failure modes in EMD systems. To accomplish the study's objectives, an existing failure databank of over 100 failures of EMD systems was collected and surveyed from the field. The historical information and failure rate models that were collected for the electric motors are investigated and used to model the prediction model of the EMD system. Three competing failure modes were found to dominate motor life: bearing failures, winding failures and shaft failures. A mathematical model for each of these failure modes with dominant variables is developed, and a risk failure model is established.",53
"Background: Most countries have started to educate students with special educational needs (SEN) in mainstream schools, but it remains unclear how inclusive attitudes towards students with SEN can be promoted. Aims: This study investigated the role of adolescents' friendships and socio-moral competencies for their attitudes towards the inclusion of students with SEN. Specifically, we studied whether adolescents without SEN would develop more inclusive attitudes if they had close friendships with SEN students and if they expressed negative emotions about social exclusion. Methods: Adolescents' inclusive attitudes and their emotions were gathered from survey data of 1225 Swiss students aged 11-13. Social network data were collected to assess adolescents' friendship relationships. Results: The results indicated that adolescents' friendship closeness with SEN students positively related to their inclusive attitudes. However, this was only true for adolescents who anticipated more negative than positive emotions if a student with SEN was excluded. Implications: These findings highlight the role of friendship relationships between adolescents with and without SEN and adolescents' socio-moral experiences for their attitudes towards the inclusion of peers with SEN. Thus, inclusive education may benefit from promoting friendships among students with and without SEN as well as adolescents' sociomoral competencies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",61
"A NoSQL, also called a ""Non-Relational"" or ""Not only SQL,"" database system provides an approach to data management and database design for very large sets of distributed data and real-time web applications. A NoSQL database system is also a popular data storage for information retrieval because it supports better scalability, availability, and faster data access while comparing with traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS). What the RDBMS data needs is predictable as its data is stored in structured tables by defining the relationship between the different columns. In contrary the data in NoSQL databases does not need to be stored in a structured or fixed fashion. When performance and realtime access are more concerned than consistency, such as indexing and retrieving large numbers of records, NoSQL databases are more suitable than relational databases. With their obvious advantages in better performance, scalability, and flexibility, NoSQL databases have been adopted lately by many small businesses as they are moving their increasing business data into the clouds. However, the research on the security of a specific NoSQL database system or NoSQL database systems in general is very limited. Although there are many storage advantages in NoSQL databases, the need of quick and easy access to data has been seriously affected by the security issue of NoSQL databases. This paper examines the maturity of security measures for MongoDB, a typical NoSQL database system, with aspects in both attack and defense at the code level. The experimental testing on NoSQL injections is performed with JavaScript and PHP. After the demonstration on how a server-side JavaScript injection attack against a NoSQL database system reveals the customer's private data, two methods are discussed in preventing this type of security problems from happening. It is believed that our study will help database developers not only realizing that NoSQL database systems are not designed with security as a priority but also learning how to build a security layer to their organizations' NoSQL applications to avoid NoSQL injections.",112
"Gambling help services typically evaluate treatment outcomes using self-reported responses and measurements. However, gamblers' conceptualisations and prioritisations with respect to these measurements may shift over time. Thus, changes in the self-reported responses may not always reflect true change in the individuals. This study investigated for response shift in self-report measures of psychological distress and impairment in 293 help-seeking problem gamblers. We used confirmatory factor analysis to model data structures from pre-treatment to post-treatment. The findings indicated that a response shift had occurred. Two items became less important and one item became more important in measuring psychological distress. Measurement invariance was achieved for the complete set of items for impairment. These findings provide a more in-depth understanding of the nature of self-report outcomes in otherwise routinely collected data.",41
"This naturalistic study examined differences in students' motivations for elective versus required service-learning (SL) classes. Students in two successive academic years' cohorts were surveyed by the SL center at a large Midwestern university. Analyses compared classes differing in requirements for community-based service. Students required to participate in community service as part of a class within a program required for admission to a university were less likely to: want to be involved in future community work; enroll in another SL class; and recommend their class, compared to other groups of students, including others from classes in which SL was required as part of the program in which students were enrolled. These findings suggest that students' motivations to participate in community-engaged activities are not shaped simply by whether or not community engagement is required in SL classes, but also by other factors including how the engagement opportunity is contextualized.",65
"In a chemical instrumentation course, usually analog signal conditioning, data acquisition, and digital signal processing are taught. Analog boards for easy interconnection of operational amplifiers are now available that make an introduction to analog signal processing easier. The digitization process can be demonstrated with microcontrollers. The cost of microcontroller development boards has decreased, and now they represent a cost-efficient platform to clarify the process of data acquisition. In this paper, we show the construction of a pH meter, and, as the development progresses, the characteristics of operational amplifiers and microcontrollers are exposed in the hope of making the internal operation of modern instrumentation more transparent.",51
"While hyperalgesia (increased pain sensitivity) has been suggested to contribute to the increased prevalence of clinical pain in Parkinson's disease (PD), experimental research is equivocal and mechanisms are poorly understood. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies comparing PD patients to healthy controls (HCs) in their response to experimental pain stimuli. Articles were acquired through systematic searches of major databases from inception until 10/2016. Twenty-six studies met inclusion criteria, comprising 1292 participants (PD = 739, HCs =553). Random effects meta-analysis of standardized mean differences (SMD) revealed lower pain threshold (indicating hyperalgesia) in PD patients during unmedicated OFF states (SMD = 0.51) which was attenuated during dopamine-medicated ON states (SMD = 0.23), but unaffected by age, PD duration or PD severity. Analysis of 6 studies employing suprathreshold stimulation paradigms indicated greater pain in PD patients, just failing to reach significance (SMD = 0.30, p= 0.06). These findings (a) support the existence of hyperalgesia in PD, which could contribute to the onset/intensity of clinical pain, and (b) implicate dopamine deficiency as a potential underlying mechanism, which may present opportunities for the development of novel analgesic strategies.

"The aim of this study was to identify the gene expression profile in biopsies of patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1, CIN 2, CIN 3, and microinvasive cancer by suppression subtractive hybridization and Southern blotting. After analyzing 1,800 cDNA clones, we found 198 upregulated genes, 166 downregulated, and no significant change of gene expression in 86 clones (p = 0.005). These results were validated by Northern blot analysis (p = 0.0001) in the identification of 28 overexpressed and 7 downregulated transcripts. We observed a set of genes related to the Notch signaling pathway that may be involved in the transformation of cervical cells and in the development to malignancy. The differentially expressed genes may provide useful information about the molecular mechanisms involved in human cervical carcinoma and as diagnostic markers.",39
"The discreteness of device parameters exists in the analog signal processing using conventional phase measurement methods, and the error caused by threshold voltage of comparator is difficult to estimate and eliminate. Due to this shortcoming, a method based on TMS320F28335 eCAP module for measuring the phase difference is presented. Firstly, the AC signal is amplified and filtered to eliminate the error introduced by electromagnetic interference, and then the digital signal through the Schmitt Trigger designed by CPLD is converted to wave signal with the same frequency of the signal, by capturing the edge-triggered, enters the capture interruption subroutine to calculate the number of the sampling points of one period, finally the phase difference is calculated according to correlation method. Hardware circuit and software flow chart are given. The experimental results verify the method has higher reliability and precision than conventional methods.",52
"Neutrophil extracellular traps are networks of DNA, histones and neutrophil proteins released in response to infectious and inflammatory stimuli. Although a component of the innate immune response, NETs are implicated in a range of disease processes including autoimmunity and thrombosis. This protocol describes a simple method for canine neutrophil isolation and quantification of NETs using a microplate fluorescence assay. Blood is collected using conventional venipuncture techniques. Neutrophils are isolated using dextran sedimentation and a density gradient using conditions optimized for dog blood. After allowing time for attachment to the wells of a 96 well plate, neutrophils are treated with NET-inducing agonists such as phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate or platelet activating factor. DNA release is measured by the fluorescence of a cell-impermeable nucleic acid dye. This assay is a simple, inexpensive method for quantifying NET release, but NET formation rather than other causes of cell death must be confirmed with alternative methods.",33
"We show how the longest common prefix (LCP) array can be generated as a by-product of the suffix array construction algorithm SACA-K (Nong, 2013). Our algorithm builds on Fischer's proposal (Fischer, WADS'11), and also runs in linear time, but uses only constant extra memory for constant alphabets. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"This paper presents a proposed new approach for complex control combining several simpler individual fuzzy controllers. This method is particularly useful when the case of study is a multivariable control system. The proposed method has a hierarchical architecture with 2 levels (individual fuzzy systems and a superior control to adjust the global result). The behavior of the proposed method is illustrated with a problem of flight control that requires several individual controllers. In addition a statistical comparison is performed using the t student test, where the proposed control strategy is compared against a simple fuzzy control approach. Finally, an optimization method is also applied to achieve an optimal design of the fuzzy systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",48
"It is important to establish the forecasting model of the network security situation. But the network security situation cannot be observed directly and can only be measured by other observable data. In this paper the network security situation is considered as a hidden behavior. In order to predict the hidden behavior, some methods have been proposed. However, these methods cannot use the hybrid information that includes qualitative knowledge and quantitative data. As such, a forecasting model of network security situation is proposed on the basis of the hidden belief rule base (BRB) model when the inputs are multidimensional. The initial parameters of the hidden BRB model given by experts may be subjective and inaccurate. In order to train the parameters, a revised covariance matrix adaption evolution strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm is further developed by adding a modified operator. The revised CMA-ES algorithm can optimize the parameters of the hidden BRB model effectively. The case study shows that compared with other methods, the proposed hidden BRB model and the revised CMA-ES algorithm can predict the network security situation effectively to improve the forecasting precision by making full use of qualitative knowledge.

"Recently developed models of psychopathy include such traits as fearlessness, boldness, and invulnerability. Section III of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) includes as well a psychopathy specifier that is modeled after these traits. The purpose of the current study was to test empirically the convergent and discriminant validity of the Psychopathic Personality Inventory-Revised (PPI-R), the Triarchic Psychopathy Measure (TriPM), the Elemental Psychopathy Assessment (EPA), and the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5) with respect to their relationship to one another, with traditional measures of psychopathy and antisocial personality disorder, and with a measure of the 5-factor model. Participants were 2 samples of community adults (280 and 196) who indicated that they have engaged in criminal activities. The results indicated good convergent and discriminant validity for the PPI-R, TriPM, EPA, and the PID-5 psychopathy specifiers, as well as relationships with a measure of the 5 factor model that were quite distinct from the relationships obtained for traditional measures of antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy. However, concerns are raised with respect to a reliance on reverse-coded items for the assessment of components of psychopathy.",73
"Giardia duodenalis is a flagellated intestinal protozoan responsible for infections in various hosts including humans and several wild and domestic animals. Few studies have correlated environmental contamination and clinical infections in the same region. The aim of this study was to compare groups of Giardia duodenalis from clinical and environmental sources through population genetic analyses to verify haplotype sharing and the degree of genetic similarity among populations from clinical and environmental sources in the metropolitan region of Campinas. The results showed high diversity of haplotypes and substantial genetic similarity between clinical and environmental groups of G.duodenalis. We demonstrated sharing of Giardia genotypes among the different populations studied. The comparison between veterinary and human sequences led us to identify new zoonotic genotypes, including human isolates from genetic assemblage C. The application of a population genetic analysis in epidemiological studies allows quantification of the degree of genetic similarity among populations of Giardia duodenalis from different sources of contamination. The genetic similarity of Giardia isolates among human, veterinary, and environmental groups reinforced the correlation between clinical and environmental isolates in this region, which is of great importance for public health.",34
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lethal interstitial lung disease with unknown etiology. Recent studies have indicated that heat-shock protein 27 (HSP27) contributes to the pathogenesis of IPF through the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the expression and role of HSP27 in fibroblasts during pulmonary fibrogenesis has not been investigated to date, at least to the best of our knowledge. In this study, we examined the expression of HSP27 in fibrotic lung tissue and fibroblasts from bleomycin (BLM)-challenged mice and human lung fibroblasts treated with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). The results revealed that the expression of HSP27 was significantly increased in fibrotic lung tissue and fibroblasts from BLM-challenged mice. In vitro, TGF-beta stimulated HSP27 expression in and the differentiation of human lung fibroblasts. The knockdown of Smad3 expression or nuclear factor-kappa B p65 subunit attenuated the TGF-beta-induced increase in HSP27 expression and the differentiation of human lung fibroblasts. In addition, the knockdown of HSP27 expression attenuated the TGF-beta-induced activation of ERK and Smad3, and inhibited the differentiation of human lung fibroblasts. On the whole, the findings of our study demonstrate that HSP27 expression is upregulated in lung fibroblasts during pulmonary fibrosis, and subsequently, HSP27 modulates lung fibroblast differentiation through the Smad3 and ERK pathways.",3
"The energy for the solvent regeneration of post-combustion carbon capture (PCC) process is typically provided by steam bleeding from the power plant (PP) steam cycle. The energy penalty for steam bleeding results in serious reduction in the PP capacity estimated to be in the range of 10-40%. Power plant repowering or hybridization using solar-assisted PCC (SPCC) is a promising approach to satisfy carbon capture targets as well as PP load, concurrently. The drawback of this methodology is that notable amounts of solar energy are wasted during heat transfer from solar radiation to rich solvent. This paper presents a novel approach by eliminating the costly desorber system and using solar collector pipe (i.e. parabolic trough pipe) to directly heat the rich solvent and disassociate the bonds of CO2-solvent. This novel technology lowers the process capital expenditure, and also reduces the solvent regeneration energy bringing it close to its theoretical values. The elimination of the complex desorber column also increases the flexibility of the PP operation in response for market dynamics. A case-study for Sydney-Australia shows that in comparison with SPCC methodology, this state-of-the-art approach could notably improve the economics of the process and reduce the size of solar collector field (SCF).

"Isoflavones are polyphenol compounds found mainly in legumes such as soybeans (Glycine max (L.) Merrill). These compounds can be found in different chemical forms; however, the beneficial effects for skin care have been mainly credited to their free forms. This manuscript claims to review the main effects of isoflavone aglycones on the skin, the different techniques for obtaining bioactive forms from soybeans, and the interest in incorporating them into topical systems. The benefits of dermatological application of isoflavones, as anti-aging action, estrogenic activity, wound healing properties, and antiphotocarcinogenic effects are highlighted. Moreover, the advantages and drawbacks of the extraction techniques of soybeans, methods for converting glucosides into aglycones, and purification procedures are described. Different strategies to incorporate these poorly soluble compounds in conventional or nanostructured delivery systems are also discussed. Illustrative examples especially for genistein-loaded liposomes, nanoemulsions, nanocapsules and cyclodextrin complexation are reported.",114
"Mental health professionals are increasingly aware of the need for competence in the treatment of clients with pornography-related concerns. However, while researchers have recently sought to explore efficacious treatments for pornography-related concerns, few explorations of potential clinical judgment issues have occurred. Due to the sensitive, and at times uncomfortable, nature of client disclosures of sexual concerns within therapy, therapists are required to manage their own discomfort while retaining fidelity to treatment. The present paper explores clinician examples of judgment errors that may result from feelings of discomfort, and specifically from client use of pornography. Issues of potential bias, bias management techniques, and therapeutic implications are discussed.",70
"Background: The long-term clinical outcomes of antiviral therapy for patients with chronic hepatitis C are uncertain in terms of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related morbidity and mortality according to the response to antiviral therapy. This study aimed to assess the impact of antiviral treatment on the development of HCC and mortality in patients with chronic HCV infection. Methods: A systematic review was conducted for studies that evaluated the antiviral efficacy for patients with chronic hepatitis C or assessed the development of HCC or mortality between SVR (sustained virologic response) and non-SVR patients. The methodological quality of the enrolled publications was evaluated using Risk of Bias table or Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Random-effect model meta-analyses and meta-regression were performed. Publication bias was assessed. Results: In total, 59 studies (4 RCTs, 15 prospective and 40 retrospective cohort studies) were included. Antiviral treatment was associated with reduced development of HCC (vs. no treatment; OR 0.392, 95% CI 0.275-0.557), and this effect was intensified when SVR was achieved (vs. no SVR, OR: 0.203, 95% CI 0.164-0.251). Antiviral treatment was associated with lower all-cause mortality (vs. no treatment; OR 0.380, 95% CI 0.295-0.489) and liver-specific mortality (OR 0.363, 95% CI 0.260-0.508). This rate was also intensified when SVR was achieved [all-cause mortality (vs. no SVR, OR 0.255, 95% CI 0.199-0.326), liver-specific mortality (OR 0.126, 95% CI 0.094-0.169)]. Sensitivity analyses revealed robust results, and a small study effect was minimal. Conclusions: In patients with chronic hepatitis C, antiviral therapy can reduce the development of HCC and mortality, especially when SVR is achieved.",130
"This paper proposed an energy efficient adder employing multistage latency and approximate computing technology. The delay of the adder decreases after the critical path of the adder is divided into multiple short stages with series of predictors, then the approximate computing technology is exploited to make a tradeoff between output quality and energy efficiency. The proposed design is applied into discrete cosine transformation (DCT) in image processing and support vector machine (SVM) algorithm in machine learning to verify its availability, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approximate adder provides 25.6% power delay-product (PDP) reduction and 2 orders of magnitude reduction in output error than the recent counterpart designs. Compared with the conventional accurate ripple carry adder (RCA) and Kogge stone adde (KSA), the proposed design presents 66.5% to 37.6% PDP reduction, at the cost of negligible output quality reduction, which are qualified as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) for DCT (decreases from 33.88 dB to 33.84 dB) and classification accuracy for SVM (decreases from 80.46% to 79.19%).",90
"ObjectivesHigh-level emergency medical care requires transfer of evidence-based knowledge into practice. Our study is the first to investigate the feasibility of checklists in improving prehospital emergency care.Materials and methodsThree checklists based on standard operating procedures were introduced: General principles of prehospital care, acute coronary syndrome and acute asthma/acutely exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Subsequent to prehospital care and immediately before transport, information on medical history, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures was obtained. Data of 740 emergency missions were recorded prospectively before (control group) and after implementation of checklists and compared using the (2)-test (significance level P<0.05).ResultsDocumentation on patients' history (pre-existing diseases: 69.1 vs. 74.3%; medication: 55.8 vs. 68.0%; allergies: 6.2 vs. 27.7%) and diagnostic measures (oxygen saturation: 93.2 vs. 98.1%; auscultation: 11.1 vs. 19.9%) as well as basic treatment procedures (application of oxygen: 73.2 vs. 85.3%; intravenous access: 84.6 vs. 92.2%) increased significantly. Subanalysis of acute coronary syndrome cases showed a significant increase of 12-lead ECG use (74.3 vs. 92.4%), administration of oxygen (84.2 vs. 98.6%), ASA (71.7 vs. 81.9%), heparin (71.1 vs. 84.0%), blockers (39.5 vs. 57.1%) and morphine (26.8 vs. 44.6%). In the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease subgroup, oxygen supply (78.8 vs. 98.5%) and application of inhalative and intravenous 2-mimetics (42.4 vs. 66.7% and 12.1 vs. 37.9%) increased significantly.ConclusionIntroduction of checklists for prehospital emergency care may help to improve adherence to treatment guidelines. Additional efforts (e.g. team trainings) have to be made to increase quality of care.",105
"We consider two new matrix spectral problems, and construct the corresponding soliton hierarchies of Levi type with the aid of symbolic computation by Maple.

"Low commitment to teaching amongst teachers is a problem facing the teaching profession in many countries. Gender might be an important factor in explaining what kinds of prospective teachers are attracted to teaching. This empirical study examined the relationship between student-teachers' gender, gender roles and commitment to teaching within the context of a large, university-based teacher education program in Tanzania. A self-report questionnaire was administered, comprising commitment to teaching items, gender as a demographic variable and items from Bem sex role inventory (BSRI). Cluster analysis on the masculine and feminine scale of the BSRI indicated three clusters: (1) highly androgynous students with high scores on both masculine and feminine scales, (2) medium androgynous students with relatively high scores on both masculine and feminine scales, and (3) low androgynous students with low scores in relation to the other two groups on both masculine and feminine scales of the BSRI. More female than male student-teachers reported to be highly androgynous. Covariance analysis showed that gender roles were significantly related to commitment to teaching and to intention to enter the teaching profession. Highly androgynous student-teachers reported significantly more commitment to teaching and higher intentions to enter the teaching profession compared to medium and low androgynous student-teachers. No significant relationships were found between gender, on the one hand, and commitment to teaching and the intention to enter the teaching profession, on the other hand. Findings are discussed in the context of teacher and teacher education in Tanzania.",77
"Development and validation of the surface suspended sediment concentration (SSC) models derived from the surface remote-sensing reflectance spectra [R-rs (lambda)] are important in satellite monitoring of estuarine and coastal waters. Seven empirical and seven semianalytical spectral reflectance models for evaluation of the surface SSC were compared with one another and with laboratory tank (one dataset) and in situ measurements (two datasets) performed in different natural waters of East China. All models were presented in the form of R-rs spectral ratios, in which wavelengths were selected from the list of NASA's satellite sensor, MODIS unsaturated central wavelengths. A statistical analysis has been performed to find the best models and spectral ratios for remote-sensing monitoring purposes. Analysis has shown that empirical models are generally superior to the semianalytical models for solution existence, prediction accuracy, and correlation with the observed SSC values. However, all semianalytical models using the red to green spectral ratio have demonstrated approximately the same accuracy and correlation as empirical models, what provides an additional support for using more simple easily calculated empirical models. Additionally, relationships between SSC and inherent optical properties (IOPs) (absorption and backscattering coefficients) and between IOPs and R-rs (lambda) provided by the semianalytical models have their own benefits for aquatic optics and remote sensing purposes.",96
"The postharvest pathogen Penicillium digitatum causes green mold decay on citrus fruit, resulting in severe economic losses. To explore possible factors involved in fungal pathogenesis, phenotypic characterization of the budding yeast Fus3/Kiss1 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase homolog was carried out. The P. digitatum MAP kinase B coding gene, designated PdMpkB, was functionally inactivated via homologous recombination. The fungal strain (Delta PdMpkB) carrying a PdMpkB deletion demonstrated altered gene expression profiles, reduced growth and conidiogenesis, elevated resistance to osmotic stress, and failed to induce green mold decay on citrus fruit. Delta PdMpkB was more resistant to CaCl2, NaCl and sorbitol than its progenitor strain, indicating a negative regulatory function of PdMpkB in osmotic stress adaptation. Fungal infection assays on citrus fruit revealed that Delta PdMpkB proliferated poorly within host tissues, induced water-soaking lesions, failed to break through host cuticle layers and thus, failed to produce aerial hyphae and conidia. Introduction of a functional copy of PdMpkB into a null mutant restored all defective phenotypes. Transcriptome analysis revealed that inactivation of PdMpkB impacted expression of the genes associated with cell wall-degrading enzyme activities, carbohydrate and amino acid metabolisms, conidial formation, and numerous metabolic processes. Our results define pivotal roles of the PdMpkB-mediated signaling pathway in developmental and pathological functions in the citrus postharvest pathogen P. digitatum. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"Aims. Adults who experienced the 1992 and 2008 armed conflicts in the Republic of Georgia were exposed to multiple traumatic events and stressors over many years. The aim was to investigate what coping strategies are used by conflict-affected persons in Georgia and their association with mental disorders. Method. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 3600 adults, representing internally displaced persons (IDPs) from conflicts in the 1990s (n = 1200) and 2008 (n = 1200) and former IDPs who returned to their homes after the 2008 conflict (n = 1200). Post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety and coping strategies were measured using the Trauma Screening Questionnaire, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalised Anxiety and adapted version of the Brief Coping Inventory, respectively. Descriptive and multivariate regression analyses were used. Results. Coping strategies such as use of humour, emotional support, active coping, acceptance and religion were significantly associated with better mental health outcomes. Coping strategies of behavioural and mental disengagement, denial, venting emotions, substance abuse and gambling were significantly associated with poorer mental health outcomes. The reported use of coping strategies varied significantly between men and women for 8 of the 15 strategies addressed. Conclusions. Many conflict-affected persons in Georgia are still suffering mental health problems years after the conflicts. A number of specific coping strategies appear to be associated with better mental health and should be encouraged and supported where possible.",108
"Capillary electrophoresis is an important analytical separation method used to study a wide variety of samples, including those of biological origin. Capillary electrophoresis may be covered in the classroom, especially in advanced analytical courses, and while many students are exposed to gel electrophoresis in biology or biochemistry laboratories, capillary electrophoresis is not as commonly found in undergraduate lab curricula. Published lab experiments that incorporate capillary electrophoresis include the analysis of caffeine in beverages and cations in water samples but not of more biological samples such as a peptide mixture. This paper introduces a peptide separation based on capillary zone electrophoresis that is both qualitative and quantitative. It describes the separation of four small peptides where two of the analytes have similar migration times, forcing students to think about how they can best identify which peak corresponds to which analyte, while exposing them to a bioanalytical application of capillary electrophoresis.",81
"Introduction: The intensive care unit (ICU) is a dynamic and complex learning environment. The wide range in trainee's experience, specialty training, fluctuations in patient acuity and volume, limitations in trainee duty hours, and additional responsibilities of the faculty contribute to the challenge in providing a consistent experience with traditional educational strategies. The ""flipped classroom"" is an educational model with the potential to improve the learning environment. In this paradigm, students gain exposure to new material outside class and then use class time to assimilate the knowledge through problem-solving exercises or discussion. The rationale and pedagogical foundations for the flipped classroom are reviewed, practical considerations are discussed, and an example of successful implementation is provided. Methods: An education curriculum was devised and evaluated prospectively for teaching point-of-care echocardiography to residents rotating in the surgical ICU. Results: Preintervention and postintervention scores of knowledge, confidence, perceived usefulness, and likelihood of use the skills improved for each module. The quality of the experience was rated highly for each of the sessions. Conclusion: The flipped classroom education curriculum has many advantages. This pilot study was well received, and learners showed improvement in all areas evaluated, across several demographic subgroups and self-identified learning styles.",81
"Purpose: New teacher effectiveness measures have the potential to influence how principals hire teachers as they provide new and richer information about candidates to a traditionally information-poor process. This article examines how the hiring process is changing as a result of teacher evaluation reforms. Research Methods: Data come from interviews with more than 100 central office personnel and 76 principals in six urban school districts and two charter management organizations. These sites were systematically sampled based on the amount of time and resources devoted to creating data systems and implementing processes that allow principals access to teacher effectiveness data. In addition to the fieldwork, we also surveyed all principals in six of the eight systems. A total of 795 principals responded to the survey, with an overall response rate of 85%. Findings: The findings suggest that while teacher effectiveness data can be used to inform hiring decisions there is variation in how and the extent to which principals use these measures in hiring. This variation is explained by central office practices as they mediated how principals approached teacher effectiveness data in the hiring process, as well as individual principal characteristics such as principal knowledge and skills, perceived validity of data, and social capital. Implications for Research and Practice: Our results demonstrate ways in which school systems and principals are incorporating teacher effectiveness data into the hiring process. Both principal preparation programs and school systems should focus on ensuring that principals have the skills and resources to use data for human capital decisions.",66
"The aim of this work was to determine antioxidant capacities, neuroprotective, skin care, antidiabetic effects, and fatty acid composition of Anchusa undulata subsp. hybrida. The antioxidant activity was screened by four different test systems including total antioxidant, antiradical, reducing power, and metal chelating activities. Neuroprotective potential was determined by anticholinesterase inhibitor assay. Tyrosinase inhibitory activity was tested to detect skin care effect. Antidiabetic effects were evaluated with alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory assays. Inhibitory activities on acetycholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, tyrosinase, alpha-amylase, and alpha-glucosidase enzymes were observed as 2.238 and 1.239 mu mol GALAEs/g, 0.339 mmol KAEs/g, 0.193, and 0.219 mmol ACEs/g extract, respectively. Amount of total phenolics and flavonoids were found as 80.34 mu g GAEs/mg and 25.09 mu g QEs/mg in the extract, respectively. Twenty-three fatty acids were found in the aerial parts, being oleic acid (24.30 g/100 g of total fatty acids) the most abundant, followed by linoleic (21.19 g/100 g of total fatty acids) and palmitic acids (17.50 g/100 g of total fatty acids).",114
"This study examines how Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) events are marketed in order to understand the role of violence in promoting events. Researchers examined 134 pieces of promotional artwork and 57 promotional news releases by MMA organisations across North America, Asia and Europe and found that 18 (13.4%) pieces of promotional artwork used violent text or imagery. Violent text was found in 12 (21%) of the 57 news releases. Violence was typically limited to smaller or European organisations. Results illustrate an evolution of the sport, suggesting violence may no longer be necessary to promote events.",74
"Graphics processing unit (GPU) has significantly increased the computing capacity of state-of-the-art high performance computing systems. This paper presents a novel GPU acceleration approach for transient stability-constrained optimal power flow (TSCOPF), which is one of the most computational challenging tasks in large-scale power system applications. Enabled by the revealed two-level decomposition parallelism in reduced-space interior point method, GPUs serve as plug-andplay coprocessors for time-consuming linear algebra operations in TSCOPF solving. Enhanced by multi-GPU processing and mixed-precision iterative refinement technique, the efficiency of solving TSCOPF is greatly improved without redesigning and reimplementing the existing algorithm framework. Numerical studies based on a series of test cases with up to 12 951 buses indicate the effectiveness of the proposed GPU-based approach for large-scale TSCOPF problems.",101
"Purpose of Review Sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) block has been used by clinicians in the treatment of a variety of headache disorders, facial pain syndromes, and other facial neuralgias. The sensory and autonomic fibers that travel through the SPG provided the scientific rationale for symptoms associated with these head and neck syndromes. Yet, despite the elucidation of this pathogenic target, the optimal method to block its pain-producing properties has not been determined. Clinicians have developed various invasive and non-invasive techniques, each of which has shown variable rates of success. We examined the available studies of sphenopalatine ganglion blockade and its efficacy in the treatment of cluster headaches, migraines, and other trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias. Recent Findings Studies have demonstrated that SPG blockade and neurostimulation can provide pain relief in patients with cluster headaches, migraines, and other trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias. Patients with these conditions showed varying levels and duration of pain relief from SPG blockade. The efficacy of SPG blockade could be related to the different techniques targeting the SPG and choice of therapeutic agents. Summary Based on current studies, SPG blockade is a safe and effective treatment for chronic headaches such as cluster headaches, migraines, and other trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias. Future studies are warranted to define the optimal image-guided technique and choice of pharmacologic agents for SPG blockade as an effective treatment for chronic headaches related to activation of the sphenopalatine ganglion.",127
"Prior studies suggest that increased urine albumin is associated with a heightened fracture risk in women, but results in men are unclear. We used data from Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS), a prospective cohort study of community-dwelling men aged 65 years, to evaluate the association of increased urine albumin with subsequent fractures and annualized rate of hip bone loss. We calculated albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) from urine collected at the 2003-2005 visit. Subsequent clinical fractures were ascertained from triannual questionnaires and centrally adjudicated by review of radiographic reports. Total hip BMD was measured by DXA at the 2003-2005 visit and again an average of 3.5 years later. We estimated risk of incident clinical fracture using Cox proportional hazards models, and annualized BMD change using ANCOVA. Of 2982 men with calculable ACR, 9.4% had ACR 30mg/g (albuminuria) and 1.0% had ACR 300mg/g (macroalbuminuria). During a mean of 8.7 years of follow-up, 20.0% of men had an incident clinical fracture. In multivariate-adjusted models, neither higher ACR quintile (p for trend 0.75) nor albuminuria (HR versus no albuminuria, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.20) was associated with increased risk of incident clinical fracture. Increased urine albumin had a borderline significant, multivariate-adjusted, positive association with rate of total hip bone loss when modeled in ACR quintiles (p=0.06), but not when modeled as albuminuria versus no albuminuria. Macroalbuminuria was associated with a higher rate of annualized hip bone loss compared to no albuminuria (-1.8% more annualized loss than in men with ACR <30mg/g; p<0.001), but the limited prevalence of macroalbuminuria precluded reliable estimates of its fracture associations. In these community-dwelling older men, we found no association between urine albumin levels and risk of incident clinical fracture, but found a borderline significant, positive association with rate of hip bone loss.

"The aim of this study was to follow several sequence histological changes that occur during the histogenesis of the rumen in one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius). Histogenesis study was carried out on 66 fetuses of camel from 50th day of gestation until birth (390 days), according to the most relevant histo-differentiation characteristics of the rumen in fetuses, these were divided into four groups: group I (5-24 cm crown-rump length (C-RL); 50-140 days); group II (24-30 cm C-RL; 140160 days); group III (30-60 cm C-RL; 160-250 days); group IV (60-108 cm C-RL; 250-390 days). At 50 days, the rumen consisted of four layers: the epithelial layer, propria-submucosa, tunica muscularis and serosa. The epithelium glandular region was pseudostratified and in non-glandular region was stratified. The muscularis mucosa was observed incompletely from 140 days between lamina propria and submucosa in glandular region of the rumen to the birth day. The primary lymphatic nodules appeared in lamina propria of glandular region of the rumen at 160 days of gestation. The epithelium of the glandular region in rumen was formed by a simple columnar layer at 250 days. In all groups, the tunica muscularis layer of rumen was increased with ruminal development, gradually. The non-glandular region of rumen was formed by a stratified epithelium and number of these cells increased with ruminal development. The lymphatic nodules and muscularis mucosa in non-glandular region did not observe in all groups. The study observations revealed that non-glandular region of the rumen in the fetuses of camel are less precocious than the rumen of the domestic ruminants. (C) 2011 PVJ. All rights reserved",75
"Background: Ectoine and its derivative 5-hydroxyectoine are cytoprotectants widely synthesized by microorganisms as a defense against the detrimental effects of high osmolarity on cellular physiology and growth. Both ectoines possess the ability to preserve the functionality of proteins, macromolecular complexes, and even entire cells, attributes that led to their description as chemical chaperones. As a consequence, there is growing interest in using ectoines for biotechnological purposes, in skin care, and in medical applications. 5-Hydroxyectoine is synthesized from ectoine through a region-and stereo-specific hydroxylation reaction mediated by the EctD enzyme, a member of the non-heme-containing iron(II) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. This chemical modification endows the newly formed 5-hydroxyectoine with either superior or different stress-protecting and stabilizing properties. Microorganisms producing 5-hydroxyectoine typically contain a mixture of both ectoines. We aimed to establish a recombinant microbial cell factory where 5-hydroxyectoine is (i) produced in highly purified form, and (ii) secreted into the growth medium. Results: We used an Escherichia coli strain (FF4169) defective in the synthesis of the osmostress protectant trehalose as the chassis for our recombinant cell factory. We expressed in this strain a plasmid-encoded ectD gene from Pseudomonas stutzeri A1501 under the control of the anhydrotetracycline-inducible tet promoter. We chose the ectoine hydroxylase from P. stutzeri A1501 for our cell factory after a careful comparison of the in vivo performance of seven different EctD proteins. In the final set-up of the cell factory, ectoine was provided to salt-stressed cultures of strain FF4169 (pMP41; ectD(+)). Ectoine was imported into the cells via the osmotically inducible ProP and ProU transport systems, intracellularly converted to 5-hydroxyectoine, which was then almost quantitatively secreted into the growth medium. Experiments with an E. coli mutant lacking all currently known mechanosensitive channels (MscL, MscS, MscK, MscM) revealed that the release of 5-hydroxyectoine under osmotic steady-state conditions occurred independently of these microbial safety valves. In shake-flask experiments, 2.13 g l(-1) ectoine (15 mM) was completely converted into 5-hydroxyectoine within 24 h. Conclusions: We describe here a recombinant E. coli cell factory for the production and secretion of the chemical chaperone 5-hydroxyectoine free from contaminating ectoine.",114
"The gene encoding a cellobiohydrolase 7B (CBH7B) of the thermophilic fungus Thielavia terrestris was identified, subcloned, and expressed in Pichia pastoris. CBH7B encoded 455 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 51.8 kDa. Domain analysis indicated that CBH7B contains a family 7 glycosyl hydrolase catalytic core but lacks a carbohydrate-binding module. Purified CBH7B exhibited optimum catalytic activity at pH 5.0 and 55 degrees C with 4-methylumbelliferryl-cellobioside as the substrate and retained 85% of its activity following 24 H incubation at 50 degrees C. Despite the lack of activity toward microcrystalline substrates, this enzyme worked synergistically with the commercial enzyme cocktail Cellic((R)) CTec2 to enhance saccharification by 39% when added to a reaction mixture containing 0.25% alkaline pretreated oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB). Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy suggested a reduction of lignin and crystalline cellulose in OPEFB samples supplemented with CBH7B. Scanning electron microscopy revealed greater destruction extent of OPEFB strands in samples supplemented with CBH7B as compared with the nonsupplemented control. Therefore, CBH7B has the potential to complement commercial enzymes in hydrolyzing lignocellulosic biomass. (C) 2015 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",30
"Objective Children with autism have sitting and on-task behavior problems in class. In this study, the effect of three alternative classroom-seating devices such as regular classroom chairs, therapy balls, and air cushions were examined on students' classroom behavior. Materials & Methods 15 students with autism participated in this A1-B-A2-C multiple treatments study from Mashhad's Tabasom School, Mashhad, Iran in 2014. Students' behaviors were video recorded in three phases: sitting on their common chairs during phase A, air-sit cushioned in phase B, and ball chairs in phase C. Sitting times and on-task behaviors were quantified by momentary time sampling and compared during different phases for important changes during 8 wk. Additionally, the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale-Second Edition test was used to examine stereotyped movements, social and communication skills of the students in the before and after research. Results Significant increases in in-seat behaviors in 86.7% (thirteen out of 15) of the students and on-task behaviors in 53.3% of the students (eight out of 15) when seated on therapy balls. Air cushions had no significant effects on in-seat/on-task behaviors. The results also showed significant decrease in stereotyped movement and increase in communication and social skills of these students. The teachers also preferred the use of the balls and/ or air-cushioned chairs for their students. Conclusion Therapy ball chairs facilitated in-seat behavior and decreased autism related behavior of the students with Autism Spectrum Disorder in class.",80
"Traditional surveying methods of soil properties over landscapes are dramatically cost and time-consuming. Thus, remote sensing is a proper choice for monitoring environmental problem. This research aims to study the effect of environmental factors on soil salinity and to map the spatial distribution of this salinity over the southern east part of Tunisia by means of remote sensing and geostatistical techniques. For this purpose, we used Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer data to depict geomorphological parameters: elevation, slope, plan curvature (PLC), profile curvature (PRC), and aspect. Pearson correlation between these parameters and soil electrical conductivity (ECsoil) showed that mainly slope and elevation affect the concentration of salt in soil. Moreover, spectral analysis illustrated the high potential of short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands to identify saline soils. To map soil salinity in southern Tunisia, ordinary kriging (OK), minimum distance (MD) classification, and simple regression (SR) were used. The findings showed that ordinary kriging technique provides the most reliable performances to identify and classify saline soils over the study area with a root mean square error of 1.83 and mean error of 0.018.",94
"Introduction: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of angiosome targeted (direct) revascularisation according to revascularisation method in patients with diabetes. Materials and methods: This retrospective study cohort comprised 545 diabetic patients with critical limb ischaemia and tissue loss (Rutherford 5, 6). All patients underwent infrapopliteal endovascular (PTA) or open surgical revascularisation between January 2008 and December 2013. Differences in the outcome after direct revascularisation, bypass surgery, and PTA were investigated by means of Cox proportional hazards analysis. The endpoints were wound healing, leg salvage, and amputation free survival. Results: Overall, 60.3% of the ischaemic wounds healed during 1 year of follow-up. The highest wound healing rate was achieved after direct bypass (77%) and the worst after indirect PTA (52%). The Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that the number of affected angiosomes= 10 mg/dL (HR 2.05, 95% CI 1.45-2.90), atrial fibrillation (HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.05-2.26), and number of affected angiosomes >3 (HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.24-2.46) were significantly associated with poor leg salvage. Direct PTA was associated with a lower rate of major amputation compared with indirect PTA (HR 0.57 95% CI 0.37-0.89). Conclusion: In diabetics, indirect endovascular revascularisation leads to significantly worse wound healing and leg salvage rates compared with direct revascularisation. Therefore, endovascular procedures should be targeted according to the angiosome concept. In bypass surgery, however, the concept is of less value and the artery with the best runoff should be selected as the outflow artery. (C) 2017 European Society for Vascular Surgery.

"Human prosocial behavior emerges in the 2nd year of life, posing challenging questions about mechanism. An increasingly common claim is that prosocial behavior in the first 3 years of life is neither a result of nor affected by socialization. In this article, we argue that early socialization plays a critical role in the developmental origins of prosocial behavior. To support this argument, we highlight conceptual perspectives and empirical evidence for influences of socialization from parents' reports, direct observation, and experimental studies. We conclude that progress in explaining the ontogenetic origins of human prosocial behavior depends on more fully specifying mechanisms of socialization in infancy as well as what and how human infants learn from their social experiences.",65
"Classroom observation is an important part of language teacher education (Kelly & Grenfell 2004) but its effects could be enhanced through observation and guided analysis of video-recorded lessons. As a Matter of fact, focus on teacher talk and on its specific conversational patterns (Sinclair 1982, Sinclair & Brazil 1982) could be of great benefit on teacher education. Moreover, digital data (audio, video and text) presenting natural speech in context would be a relevant tool for teacher trainers, in order to help their trainees to develop teaching awareness and interaction ability, especially if such data are easily and freely accessible and properly treated through new methods of computer-based multimodal analysis. In this study we have analysed, through a multimodal approach, teacher talk questioning in several L2 and LS Italian classrooms. Questioning is one of the most common techniques used by teachers (Richards, 1996) and serves as the principal way in which teachers control the classroom interaction. In some classrooms over half of class time is taken up by question-and-answer exchanges (Richards, 1996). We have focused on two main types of questions: display questions and referential questions. Through the usage of some video-recorded lessons, transcribed and subtitled, we have investigated the presence and relevance of non-linguistic patterns, that match with regularity with these linguistic phenomena. Particularly, we have examined specific non-verbal and para-verbal activities made by the speakers, tightly linked to the various types of questions, and we have noted that there are recurring behaviours used together with the over mentioned linguistic structures, to express specific communicative and didactic scopes and functions, that is to say to build and spread knowledge in a L2/LS Italian classroom.",64
"Purpose Despite advances that have been made in systemic chemotherapy, the prognosis of advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients is still poor. The identification of key factors governing TNBC development is considered imperative for the development of novel effective therapeutic approaches. Previously, it has been reported that microRNA (miR)-761 may act as either a tumor suppressor or as an oncogene in different types of cancer. Here, we aimed at assessing the biological role of this miRNA in TNBC. Methods First, we measured the expression of miR-761 in primary breast cancer tissues and breast cancer-derived cell lines using qRT-PCR. Subsequently, over-expression and silencing experiments were performed to determine the role of miR-761 in TNBC cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion in vitro. The in vivo role of miR-761 in TNBC growth and metastasis was determined in mouse models. Bioinformatics analyses, dual-luciferase reporter assays, Western blot analyses and rescue experiments were performed to identify miR-761 target gene(s). Results We found that miR-761 was up-regulated in primary breast cancer tissues and its derived cell lines and, particularly, in TNBC tissues and cell lines. We also found that exogenous miR-761 over-expression augmented in vitro TNBC cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion, whereas miR-761 down-regulation impaired these features. In vivo, we found that miR-761 over-expression facilitated TNBC growth and lung metastasis. Mechanistically, miR-761 was found to negatively regulate the expression of tripartite motif-containing 29 (TRIM29) in TNBC cells by binding to the 3'-untranslated region of its mRNA. In conformity with these results, a significant negative correlation between miR-761 expression and TRIM29 protein expression was noted in primary TNBC tissues (r = -0.452, p = 0.0126). We also found that exogenous TRIM29 over-expression reversed the proliferative and invasive capacities of TNBC cells. Conclusions Our data indicate that miR-761 acts as an oncogene in TNBC. This mode of action can, at least partially, be ascribed to the down-regulation of its target TRIM29. We suggest that miR-761 may serve as a promising therapeutic target for TNBC.",42
"Although an increasing number of HIV infected people are accessing antiretroviral treatment, many do not achieve complete HIV viral suppression and remain at risk for AIDS and capable of HIV transmission. Food insecurity has been identified as a potential risk factor for poor virologic response, but the association between these factors has been inconsistently documented in the literature. We systematically searched five electronic databases and bibliographies of relevant studies through April 2015 and retrieved 11 studies that met our inclusion criteria, of which nine studies were conducted in North America and the remaining two studies were in Brazil and Uganda respectively. Meta-analyzed results indicated that experiencing food insecurity resulted in 29% lower odds of achieving complete HIV viral suppression (OR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.61-0.82) and this significant inverse association was consistently found regardless of study design, exposure measurement, and confounder adjustment methods. These findings suggest that food insecurity is a potential risk factor for incomplete HIV viral suppression in people living with HIV.",132
"An avian analogue of human fronto-executive dysfunction was used to study the long-term effects of a repeated low dose of MK-801. MK-801 is known to selectively antagonize the excitatory N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDA(R)) and indirectly impair inhibitory related processes (GABA-(AR)). First, eight pigeons were divided into two groups, receiving either 0.15 mg/kg MK-801 or saline (i.p.) 1-hour prior to each session. Thirty 90-min sessions of a Differential Reinforcement of Low Rate of Response (DRL-10s) schedule were run over 3-months. Both overall number of responses and efficiency were unaffected by treatment, establishing a sub-threshold motoric dose. Then, another eight pigeons, treated identically, were given an operant visual discrimination task. Results demonstrated impairment of the fronto-striatal function of both excitatory and inhibitory processes in the MK801 group during the entire 3-months. A 30-session treatment cross-over showed that the Saline-to-MK-801 group was unaffected, whereas the MK-801-to-Saline group exhibited rapid recovery of inhibitory control, however excitatory control did not fully recover. Together, these results suggested that the NMDA(R) system is involved in the acquisition of excitatory learning, but only in the expression of inhibitory learning. Our findings were discussed in terms of the value of avian models in translational research. Furthermore, our results were examined within the context of the NIH Research Domain of Criteria initiative and the rule of NMDA(R) disruption, which underlie executive dysfunction in various neuropsychiatric disorders. Finally, our findings suggested that the potential long-term effects of the clinical and recreational use of NMDA(R) antagoniks require further study. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",72
This work considers a parallel algorithm for solving multidimensional multiextremal optimization problems. This algorithm uses Peano-type space filling curves for dimension reduction. Conditions of non-redundant parallelization of the algorithm are considered. Efficiency of the algorithm on modern computing systems with the use of graphics processing units (GPUs) is investigated. Speedup of the algorithm using GPU as compared with the same algorithm implemented on CPU only is demonstrated experimentally. Computational experiments are carried out on a series of several hundred multidimensional multiextremal problems.,101
"We have developed a robust sensor for mounting on bridges over rivers and streams. These bridge-mounted river stage sensors (BMRSS) make periodic measurements of the distance from the sensor to the water level below. Properly interpreted, these measurements provide river-stage information, data of great importance to society and crucial to effective flood forecasting. The traditional approach to river stage measurement is the installation of pipes in rivers, digging stilling wells, and the construction of attendant brick-and-mortar infrastructure. The cost of this approach limits the deployment to larger rivers. In most instances, river-stage data from smaller tributaries are few, even though such data can greatly enhance the quality of flood-forecasting models' outputs. In contrast, BMRSS units are an order of magnitude less expensive and allow for widespread deployment. BMRSS units incorporate an ultrasonic distance measuring module, a solar panel/battery/charge controller, and a GPS receiver. In recent years, the Internet access through commercial cellular networks has become ubiquitous, even in most rural areas. BMRSS units incorporate cell modems and transmit data through the Internet to servers at the Iowa Flood Center. Here, the data are ingested into relational databases and made available to flood forecasting models and information systems. We have deployed and operated more than 220 BMRSS units across Iowa, many for several years continuously.",112
"Present article deals with some exact solutions of (2 + 1)-dimensional system of coupled Konopelchenko Dubrovsky equations. Similarity transformations method is proposed to seek the solution of the system using Lie group theory. The Lie group theory is a very strong tool by which complicated, nonlinear partial differential equations under the group transformations remains invariant. A brief review of Lie symmetries of a system of partial differential equations has been described. During the process, method reduces the number of independent variables by one. Hence, the system of partial equations reduces into a new system of ordinary differential equations. In addition, the infinitesimals after first reductions are more general than the previous established results by us (Kumar et al., 2016). Consequently, solutions so derived are more general than previously known results. We have obtained nine solutions in the explicit form, some of them are more general and some are new for the best knowledge of us. Ultimately, single solitons, multi solitons and shocks behaviour is represented graphically through the numerical simulation for physical validation of the results. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"Gitelman's syndrome (GS) is characterized by hypokalemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypocalciuria, metabolic alkalosis, and neurological symptoms. The association of GS with type 1 diabetes is rare, described only in a few case reports. We report a patient with an unusual combination of GS and type 1 diabetes mellitus with erythrocytosis. A 26-year-old male with GS and type 1 diabetes, who was on intensive insulin therapy with poor compliance, presented with the complaint of headache. On physical examination, his blood pressure was 120/70 mmHg and there was no neurological deficit or proximal muscle weakness. He had no previous medical history of obstructive sleep apnea, heart or lung disease. He had negative smoking history. His laboratory tests revealed erythrocytosis with a hemoglobin level of 18.9 g/dL (13.6-17.2 g/dL) and a hematocrit level of 54.8% (39.5-50.3%). Cranial magnetic resonance imaging was normal. He had no evidence of hypovolemia. Hematological workout excluded polycythemia vera and chronic myeloid neoplasm. A bone marrow aspiration revealed a hypercellular marrow with increased erythroid precursors, megakaryocytes and granulocytes. The reticulin stain grade was zero. There was no iron accumulation with iron stain. There was no radiologic evidence of any kind of erythropoietin-producing tumors. His echocardiography was normal. Serum insulin-like growth factor-1 levels and endogenous androgens were within normal limits. After 2 therapeutic phlebotomies, his symptoms improved and his hemoglobin was 16.1 mg/dL. Our patient, besides having GS and type 1 diabetes, was complicated with idiopathic erythrocytosis, all having deleterious effects on hemodynamic status of the patient.",20
"This pilot study was designed to measure teamwork and the relationship of teamwork to patient perceptions of care among 63 members of 12 oncology teams at a Cancer Centre in the Midwest. Lack of teamwork in cancer care can result in serious clinical errors, fragmentation of care, and poor quality of care. Many oncology team members, highly skilled in clinical care, are not trained to work effectively as members of a care team. The research team administered the Relational Coordination survey to core oncology team membersmedical oncologists, nurse coordinators, and clinical secretariesto measure seven dimensions of team skills (four relating to communication [frequency, timeliness, accuracy, and problem solving] and three relating to relationship [shared goals, shared knowledge, and mutual respect]) averaged to create a Relational Coordination Index. The results indicated that among the team member roles, nurse coordinator relational coordination indices were the strongest and most positively correlated with patient perception of care. Statistically significant correlations were intra-nurse coordinator relational coordination indices and two patient perception of care factors (information and education and patient's preferences). All other nurse coordinator intra-role as well as inter-role correlations were also positively correlated, although not statistically significant.",81
"BACKGROUND Familial combined hypolipidemia, a Mendelian condition characterized by substantial reductions in all 3 major lipid fractions, is caused by mutations that inactivate the gene angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3). Whether ANGPTL3 deficiency reduces risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) is unknown. OBJECTIVES The study goal was to leverage 3 distinct lines of evidence-a family that included individuals with complete (compound heterozygote) ANGPTL3 deficiency, a population based-study of humans with partial (heterozygote) ANGPTL3 deficiency, and biomarker levels in patients with myocardial infarction (MI)-to test whether ANGPTL3 deficiency is associated with lower risk for CAD. METHODS We assessed coronary atherosclerotic burden in 3 individuals with complete ANGPTL3 deficiency and 3 wild-type first-degree relatives using computed tomography angiography. In the population, ANGPTL3 loss-of-function (LOF) mutations were ascertained in up to 21,980 people with CAD and 158,200 control subjects. LOF mutations were defined as nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site variants, along with missense variants resulting in <25% of wild-type ANGPTL3 activity in a mouse model. In a biomarker study, circulating ANGPTL3 concentration was measured in 1,493 people who presented with MI and 3,232 control subjects. RESULTS The 3 individuals with complete ANGPTL3 deficiency showed no evidence of coronary atherosclerotic plaque. ANGPTL3 gene sequencing demonstrated that approximately 1 in 309 people was a heterozygous carrier for an LOF mutation. Compared with those without mutation, heterozygous carriers of ANGPTL3 LOF mutations demonstrated a 17% reduction in circulating triglycerides and a 12% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Carrier status was associated with a 34% reduction in odds of CAD (odds ratio: 0.66; 95% confidence interval: 0.44 to 0.98; p = 0.04). Individuals in the lowest tertile of circulating ANGPTL3 concentrations, compared with the highest, had reduced odds of MI (adjusted odds ratio: 0.65; 95% confidence interval: 0.55 to 0.77; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS ANGPTL3 deficiency is associated with protection from CAD. (C) 2017 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.",129
"Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a lysosomal heme enzyme present in the azurophilic granules of human neutrophils and monocytes. It is a critical element of the human innate immune system by exerting antimicrobial effects. It is a disulfide bridged dimer with each monomer containing a light and a heavy polypeptide and its biosynthesis and intracellular transport includes several posttranslational processing steps. By contrast, MPO recombinantly produced in Chinese hamster ovary cell lines is monomeric, partially unprocessed and contains a N-terminal propeptide (proMPO). It mirrors a second form of MPO constitutively secreted from normal bone marrow myeloid precursors. In order to clarify the impact of posttranslational modifications on the structural integrity and enzymology of these two forms of human myeloperoxidase, we have undertaken an investigation on the conformational and thermal stability of leukocyte MPO and recombinant proMPO by using complementary biophysical techniques including UV-Vis, circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy as well as differential scanning calorimetry. Mature leucocyte MPO exhibits a peculiar high chemical and thermal stability under oxidizing conditions but is significantly destabilized by addition of dithiothreitol. Unfolding of secondary and tertiary structure occurs concomitantly with denaturation of the heme cavity, reflecting the role of three MPO-typical heme to protein linkages and of six intra-chain disulfides for structural integrity by bridging N- and C-terminal regions of the protein. Recombinant monomeric proMPO follows a similar unfolding pattern but has a lower conformational and thermal stability. Spectroscopic and thermodynamic data of unfolding are discussed with respect to the known three-dimensional structure of leukocyte MPO as well as to known physiological roles. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

"The goal of this study was to demonstrate whether increased 18F-fluoride uptake lesions on positron emission tomography (PET) scan can predict new syndesmophyte development in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). In 12 AS patients, 18F-fluoride PET and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at baseline, and radiography was performed at baseline and the 2-year follow-up. The following data were recorded: the presence of increased 18F-fluoride uptake lesions on PET defined as an uptake greater than the uptake in the adjacent normal vertebral body; acute (type A) and advanced (type B) corner inflammatory lesions (CILs) and fat lesions on MRI; and syndesmophytes on radiography. Of 231 anterior vertebral corners without syndesmophyte at baseline, 13 type A CILs (5.5%), 2 type B CILs (0.9%), and 20 fat lesions (8.7%) on MRI and six increased fluoride uptake lesions (2.6%) on PET were observed. At the 2-year follow-up, 16 new syndesmophytes (6.9%) in eight AS patients (66.7%) occurred. New syndesmophytes developed significantly more frequently in anterior vertebral corners with increased 18F-fluoride uptake lesions (50%) or fat lesions (25%) at baseline than in those without such lesions (5.8 and 5.2%; p = 0.005 and p = 0.007, respectively). After adjusting confounding factors, baseline increased 18F-fluoride uptake lesions was independently associated with new syndesmophytes development (OR 13.8, 95% CI 1.5-124.3, p = 0.019). Fat lesions were also associated with new syndesmophytes formation. Our data suggest that 18F-fluoride PET may be applied to identify AS patients with high risk of future syndesmophyte formation.",107
"Polished finishing granites are greatly accepted for claddings because of the plates' shape, design and color variety. The features depend on the geological conditions that occur during the formation process, which include the mineralogy of the stone, the fluids formed during the process, the grain size of the minerals and the way in which the minerals interact with each other. One of the noblest uses of stone plates is in non-adherent covering systems (without mortar), such as ventilated fa double dagger ades and pedestrian paving systems. Currently, the methodology for non-adherent systems uses the allowable stress design criteria. In recent years, the number of papers indicating reliability analysis as an important design tool for natural stones has increased. However, a lack of information concerning the design methodology still happens. Therefore, the structural properties assessed as complementing these studies were: compressive strength, three-point flexural tensile strength, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. A granite slab design example was also presented. First, the thickness of the plates was determined based on the formulation proposed by Timoshenko [Strength of materials (original language, Portuguese), Volume II. Editora Ao Livro T,cnico S. A., Rio de Janeiro, 1977], using the allowable stress design criteria. Next, the reliability analysis was performed by Monte Carlo simulation. Results showed that the Desire, White granitic plate presented a higher reliability index than the Capo Bonito Red granitic plate. This result seems to be paradoxical, owing that the Capo Bonito Red presented a higher value of mean flexural strength than the Desire, White. The minimal safety factors to satisfy the target reliability value of 3.8 as recommended by the standard EN 1990:2002 (Eurocode) were found to be 2.61, 1.98 and 2.72, respectively, for the three stone types.",91
"BACKGROUND: Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) has been suggested to inhibit mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by decreasing the mitochondria' membrane potential. Experimental acute pancreatitis is associated with increased UCP2 expression, whereas UCP2 deficiency retards regeneration of aged mice from acute pancreatitis. Here, we have addressed biological and molecular functions of UCP2 in pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), which are involved in pancreatic wound repair and fibrogenesis. METHODS: PSCs were isolated from 12 months old (aged) UCP2(-/-) mice and animals of the wild-type (WT) strain C57BL/6. Proliferation and cell death were assessed by employing trypan blue staining and a 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation assay. Intracellular fat droplets were visualized by oil red 0 staining. Levels of mRNA were determined by RT-PCR, while protein expression was analyzed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analysis. Intracellular ROS levels were measured with 2,7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate. Expression of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA beta-Gal) was used as a surrogate marker of cellular senescence. RESULTS: PSCs derived from UCP2(-/-) mice proliferated at a lower rate than cells from WT mice. In agreement with this observation, the UCP2 inhibitor genipin displayed dose dependent inhibitory effects on WT PSC growth. Interestingly, ROS levels in PSCs did not differ between the two strains, and PSCs derived from UCP2(-/-) mice did not senesce faster than those from corresponding WT cells. PSCs from UCP2(-/-) mice and WT animals were also indistinguishable with respect to the activation-dependent loss of intracellular fat droplets, expression of the activation marker alpha-smooth muscle actin, type I collagen and the autocrine/paracrine mediators interleukin-6 and transforming growth factor-beta 1. CONCLUSIONS: A reduced proliferative capacity of PSC from aged UCP2(-/-) mice may contribute to the retarded regeneration after acute pancreatitis. Apart from their slower growth, PSC of UCP2(-/-) mice displayed no functional abnormalities. The antifibrotic potential of UCP2 inhibitors deserves further attention.",31
"this paper presents triple mode to optimize settling, current consumption and noise of a crystal oscillator (XTAL). The proposed XTAL driver has three mode. Fast settling mode is used to reduce settling time. To reduce the start-up time of a XTAL driver, internal noise booster (INB) and negative resistance booster (NRB) are proposed. The simulated start-up time of a 4.19403MHz XTAL Driver in 0.18um CMOS is reduced by 80% from 4ms to 800us. Retention mode is only operated in stand-by to reduce total power consumption. A Peak and Low detection (PLD) is proposed. The stand-by of the XTAL driver does not effect to load. Therefore, the PLD blocks input supply voltage until HVT signal goes to down. It reduces power consumption up to 60%. EMI reduction mode is proposed to reduce output spur noise. To reduce output spur noise, pseudorandom-number generator (PRNG) is used makes 4bits random signal to spread frequency up to -10dB. All mode is controlled by Digital Control block. An inverter amplifier driver is optimized to reduce power consumption to 30uA and gets +/- 100 ppm operation in changing temperature from -40 degrees C to 60 degrees C.",48
"Educational attainment has been shown to be positively associated with mental health and a potential buffer to stressful events. One stressful life event likely to affect everyone in their lifetime is bereavement. This paper assesses the effect of educational attainment on mental health post-bereavement. By utilising large administrative datasets, linking Census returns to death records and prescribed medication data, we analysed the bereavement exposure of 208,332 individuals aged 25-74 years. Two-level multi-level logistic regression models were constructed to determine the likelihood of antidepressant medication use (a proxy of mental ill health) post-bereavement given level of educational attainment. Individuals who are bereaved have greater antidepressant use than those who are not bereaved, with over a quarter (26.5 %) of those bereaved by suicide in receipt of antidepressant medication compared to just 12.4 % of those not bereaved. Within individuals bereaved by a sudden death, those with a university degree or higher qualifications are 73 % less likely to be in receipt of antidepressant medication compared to those with no qualifications, after full adjustment for demographic, socio-economic and area factors (OR 0.27, 95 % CI 0.09,0.75). Higher educational attainment and no qualifications have an equivalent effect for those bereaved by suicide. Education may protect against poor mental health, as measured by the use of antidepressant medication, post-bereavement, except in those bereaved by suicide. This is likely due to the improved cognitive, personal and psychological skills gained from time spent in education.",125
"Cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia (SCZ) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major driver of functional disability but is largely unresponsive to current therapeutics. Animal models of cognitive dysfunction relevant to both disorders suggest the alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) may be a promising drug development target, with multiple clinical trials subsequently testing this hypothesis in individuals with SCZ and AD. However, the translational value of rodent cognitive tasks for predicting the overall efficacy of this therapeutic target in clinical trials is unknown. To Compare effect sizes between rodent and human studies, we searched PUbMed and the Cochrane Library for all randomized, placebo-controlled trials of compounds With pharmacological activity at the alpha 7 nAChR for treatment of cognitive dysfunction in SCZ and AD and identified 18 studies comprising 2670 subjects treated with eight different compounds acting as full or partial agonists. Cognitive outcomes were standardized, and random-effects meta-analyses revealed no statistically significant effects of alpha 7 nAChR agonists on overall cognition or any of eight cognitive subdomains When all doses were included (Range of all cognitive outcomes: Cohen's d = -0.077 to 0.12, negative favoring drug). In contrast, analysis of 29 rodent studies testing the same ca agonists revealed large effect sizes in multiple commonly used preclinical behavioral tests of cognition (Range: d = -1.18 to -0.73). Our results suggest that targeting the alpha 7 nAChR with agonists is not a robust treatment for cognitive dysfunction in SCZ or AD and necessitate a better understanding of the translational gap for therapeutics targeting the a7 nAChR.

"Introduction A severe form of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the Kufor-Rakeb syndrome. Here mutations in the ATP13A2 (PARK9) gene lead to an early juvenile-onset Parkinsonism often accompanied by dementia. ATP13A2 encodes a lysosomal P-type ATPase. Its ortholog in Caenorhabditis elegans is the catp-6 gene where phenotypes with mutations in the alleles ok3473 and tm3190 show high mortality and low reproduction. Objectives Since PD is difficult to study in humans we wanted to investigate the potential to use C. elegans as model for the Kufor-Rakeb syndrome. As it is difficult to obtain enough catp-6 mutant worms for standard NMR metabolic profiling, we explored focused ultrasonication extraction and miniaturized NMR as techniques to overcome this limitation. Methods One-and two-dimensional NMR experiments (H-1, JRES, TOCSY) were performed with a commercial high-resolution magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) probe (25 mu L sample volume). Significant features were identified through analysis of variance (ANOVA, p < 0.05), volcano plots (p1.5), PCA, and PLS-DA. Results Assignment of statistically relevant peaks resulted in the identification of twenty altered metabolites. Previous studies on catp-6 mutants identified strong morphological and functional changes in their mitochondria. Our findings of altered TCA metabolites (fumarate, succinate), branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine) and nucleotides (AMP, ATP and GTP), formate and hypoxanthine appear to support these findings. Highest fold changes (< -5) in wildtype relative to both catp-6 strains were found for GTP. Formic acid is known to inhibit the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV and high hypoxanthine in catp-6 indicates an increased nucleotide salvage pathway. Alterations in most of the remaining metabolites may be the result of the recently discovered activation of AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) and inhibition of mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) pathways together with a catabolic response to recover energy production. Conclusions If the effect of the catp-6 mutation in C. elegans at the level of metabolites is correlated to the metabolic dysfunction in the human PARK9 ortholog, then it may be possible to uncover the molecular mechanism behind Parkinsonism and the Kufor-Rakeb syndrome.",19
"Background: The rostral prefrontal cortex (RPFC) is involved in reflective thought processes such as self-knowledge and person perception. We hypothesized that childhood emotional abuse, which is disruptive of emotional regulation, would differentially impact neurometabolite concentrations of the RPFC, and related neocortical areas, in adults with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) versus healthy controls. Methods: GAD patients (n=16; females =11) and medically healthy volunteers (n=16; F=10) were assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), specifically the emotional abuse category. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging examined 3 regions of interest (ROI) from the most rostral slice from the Duyn el. al. (1993) multivoxel imaging modality: rostral prefrontal cortex (BA 10,9), premotor cortex (BA 6,8) and secondary somatosensory and associated parietal cortex (BA 5,7). Meta-bolites included N-acetyl-aspartate, creatine, and choline. Results: GAD patients reported higher emotional abuse scores versus controls. An omnibus general linear model including 3 ROI, 3 metabolites, and laterality as dependent variables revealed a significant diagnosis by CTQ emotional abuse score interactive effect. In controls, all 3 ROI for all 3 metabolites on both sides demonstrated a significant inverse relationship with emotional abuse scores; none were significant in GAD patients. Limitations: A major limitation is the uneven distribution of emotional abuse scores between the controls and GAD patients, with GAD patients reporting higher scores. Conclusion: Unlike controls, GAD patients appear compromised in forming a molecular representation reflective of magnitude of childhood emotional abuse. The neurometabolites in GAD patients appear non-aligned to childhood emotional abuse, suggesting potential consequences for normative ""theory of mind"" processes and emotional function in certain anxiety disorders.

"Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by venous thromboembolism, arterial thrombosis, and obstetric morbidities in the setting of persistently positive levels of antiphospholipid antibodies measured on 2 different occasions 12 weeks apart. Patients with APS are at increased risk for accelerated atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, and valvular heart disease. Vascular endothelial cell dysfunction mediated by antiphospholipid antibodies and subsequent complement system activation play a cardinal role in APS pathogenesis. Improved understanding of their pathogenic function could help in the risk stratification of patients with APS and provide new molecular therapeutic targets.

"To establish a non-radioactive, cell-free detection system for protein N-myristoylation, metabolic labeling in a cell-free protein synthesis system using bioorthogonal myristic acid analogues was performed. After Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) with a biotin tag, the tagged proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and blotted on a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane, and then protein N-myristoylation was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin. The results showed that metabolic labeling in an insect cell-free protein synthesis system using an azide analogue of myristic acid followed by CuAAC with alkynyl biotin was the most effective strategy for cell-free detection of protein N-myristoylation. To determine whether the newly developed detection method can be applied for the detection of novel N-myristoylated proteins from complementary DNA (cDNA) resources, four candidate cDNA clones were selected from a human cDNA resource and their susceptibility to protein N-myristoylation was evaluated using the newly developed strategy. As a result, the products of three cDNA clones were found to be novel N-myristoylated protein, and myristoylation-dependent specific intracellular localization was observed for two novel N-myristoylated proteins. Thus, the metabolic labeling in an insect cell-free protein synthesis system using bioorthogonal azide analogue of myristic acid was an effective strategy to identify novel N-myristoylated proteins from cDNA resources.

"Objective. The aim of this study was to develop in vitro biofilms on SLA titanium (Ti-SLA) and zirconium oxide (ZrO2) surfaces and to evaluate the effect of antiseptic agents on the number of putative periodontal pathogenic species. Methods. An in vitro biofilm model was developed on sterile discs of Ti-SLA and ZrO2. Three antiseptic agents [chlorhexidine and cetyl-pyridinium-chloride (CHX/CPC), essential oils (EEOOs) and cetyl-peridinium-chloride (CPC)] were applied to 72-h biofilms, immersing discs during 1 min in the antiseptic solution, either with or without mechanical disruption. Viable bacteria [colony forming units (CFU/mL)] were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) combined with propidium monoazide. A generalized lineal model was constructed to determine the effect of the agents on the viable bacterial counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum on each surface. Results. The exposure to each antiseptic solution resulted in a statistically significant reductions in the number of viable target species included in the in vitro multi-species biofilm, on both Ti-SLA and ZrO2 (p < 0.001) which was of up to 2 orders for A. actinomycetemcomitans, for P. gingivalis 2 orders on Ti-SLA and up to 3 orders on ZrO2, and, for F. nucleatum up to 4 orders. No significant differences were found in counts of the tested bacteria between in vitro biofilms formed on both Ti-SLA and ZrO2, after topically exposure to the antimicrobial agents whether the application was purely chemical or combined with mechanical disruption. Significance. A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum responded similarly to their exposure to antiseptics when grown in multispecies biofilms on titanium and zirconium surfaces, in spite of the described structural differences between these bacterial communities.

"Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers. As in other cancer locations, the involvement of human papillomaviruses (HPV) has been suggested but remains highly debated with wide differences among reported prevalence of HPV infection in CRCs. Aim: To determine the actual prevalence of high risk HPV16 and 18 in a large case-control study. Methods: CRC specimens were used for analysis of both tumor and distant healthy tissue. As a nonmalignant control group, samples from sigmoid diverticulosis resections were studied. Detection of HPV16 and HPV18 DNA was performed using a real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Ten percent of tumor samples were also randomly subjected to a complete HPV genotyping using the INNO-LiPA technique. Results: 467 samples were analyzed: 217 tumor samples from 210 CRCs, 210 distant healthy tissue samples, and 40 sigmoid samples. HPV18 DNA was never amplified and HPV16 was amplified only three times in tumor tissues with viral loads under or at the limit of quantification. New extraction from the same tumor blocks for these samples revealed no HPV with qPCR and INNO-Lipa assays. Conclusion: With adequate procedures and reliable techniques, no HPV was detected in the largest case-control study so far, bringing more evidence on the absence of involvement of HPV in CRCs.

"Energy recovery both from the economic aspects and also from sustainable the use of energy, is necessitated with an optimal operational of equipment's inside the building. A Synchronous Monitoring and Real Time analysis system using an integrated monitor and control of energy recovery is presented. The test vicinity taken for this approach is based on the analysis of energy usage and the bill pay by the Taylor's University Malaysia. We have scaled down the approach to a test area restricted to a room design and employing the new methodology to optimize the energy usage. The design of this system is based on analysing the energy wastage caused by human factors and the utility usage factor. The system design proposes a real time monitoring of not just load but also the health condition of various equipment and physical environment condition, as they are the other major source for the operational inefficiency. By performing utilities usage control using SMART system, the electricity saving is expected to be 22.13 %.",85
"Objective: Several previous studies have demonstrated that comorbidities, secondary causes, physical inactivity, and osteoporosis may cause recurrence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). However, there has also been some controversy over the clinical course(s) and cause(s) of recurrent BPPV (rBPPV). We identified clinical features and associated factors, including decreased bone mineral density, in the recurrence of BPPV. Methods: In total, 198 patients with idiopathic BPPV, diagnosed at the otolaryngology clinics of Seoul National University Boramae Medical Center, were enrolled. The medical data of these patients were reviewed retrospectively. Recurrent BPPV was defined as the recurrence of BPPV after at least 1 month of a symptom-free interval following previous successful treatment. Results: Of the BPPV patients, 67 (33.8%) were classified as rBPPV. Among them, about 16% showed changes in the involved semicircular canals and about 6% showed multiple semicircular canal involvement. rBPPV was more common in patients with comorbidities (P < 0.001). Involved semicircular canals showed no statistically significant difference according to the recurrence of BPPV. The mean symptom-free interval of the rBPPV group varied from 1 to 50.2 (mean, 11.6) months; however, 90% of BPPV recurrence occurred within 24 months. Bone mineral density in dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) was markedly decreased in BPPV patients versus normal controls, but there were no significant differences according to BPPV recurrence. Conclusion: The incidence of rBPPV in idiopathic BPPV patients was 33.8% in the present study. The mean period of recurrence after a symptom-free interval was about 11.6 months; most patients showed recurrence within 2 years after the first attack of BPPV. Furthermore, about 16% of patients suffered from rBPPV at a different kind or type of canal from the semicircular canal of the initial BPPV attack. Comorbidities, but not age, gender, or the involved semicircular canal, might be correlated with BPPV recurrence. Decreased bone mineral density did not show significant association with BPPV recurrence, but showed a significant relation with BPPV occurrence. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

"ObjectivesOffspring of depressed parents are at increased risk for psychiatric disorders. Although bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are both found in the same families, it is not clear whether transmission to offspring of BD or MDD tends to occur from parents with the same mood disorder subtype. Our primary hypothesis was that the offspring of parents with BD would be at increased risk for BD and other comorbid disorders common to BD, such as anxiety and substance use, relative to the offspring of parents with MDD. The offspring of parents with BD versus those with MDD were also hypothesized to be at greater risk for externalizing disorders (i.e., conduct disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or antisocial personality disorder). MethodsParents (n=320) with mood disorders and their offspring (n=679) were studied. Adult offspring were administered the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders to establish the presence of psychopathology. Offspring aged 10-18 years were assessed using the School Aged Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, Present and Lifetime version, and parents of children under the age of ten completed the Child Behavioral Checklist. Data were examined using Cox proportional hazard regression. ResultsThere was no difference in hazard of mood disorders in the offspring of parents with BD as compared to the offspring of parents with MDD. However, a number of other parent and offspring characteristics increased the risk of mood, anxiety, externalizing, and substance use disorders in the offspring, including self-reported childhood abuse in the parent or offspring, offspring impulsive aggression, and the age at onset of parental mood disorder. ConclusionsMood disorders are highly familial, a finding that appears independent of whether the parent's condition is unipolar or bipolar, suggesting considerable overlap in the heritability of MDD and BD. Although parental characteristics had a limited influence on the risk of offspring psychopathology, reported childhood adversity, be it in the parent or child, is a harbinger of negative outcomes. These risk factors extend previous findings, and are consistent with diathesis-stress conceptualizations.",73
"The 2b protein encoded by Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) plays an important pathogenicity role in many solanaceous hosts, but mechanism of inducing disease is still unknown. In order to investigate virulence of the 2b protein on Nicotiana glutinosa plants, in terms of chloroplast structure and photosynthesis, a mutant Fny-CMV Delta 2bpro, which cannot express the 2b protein, was achieved by introducing mutant sites in the 2b gene of Fny-CMV. N. glutinosa seedlings were inoculated with wild-type Fny-CMV and the mutant Fny-CMV Delta 2bpro, and were analyzed for symptom expression, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate, and ultra-structural alteration of chloroplast. Up to 30 days post inoculation, wild-type Fny-CMV caused symptoms of severe mosaic, leaf deformation, and stunting, reduced photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll content, and altered the ultra-structure and morphological characters of the chloroplasts. However, host seedlings inoculated with the mutant Fny-CMV Delta 2bpro expressed only slight mosaic symptom. Their photosynthetic rates and chlorophyll contents were not significantly different from those of the mock-inoculated plants, and the ultra-structure and morphological characters of their chloroplasts appeared to be normal. The observed low photosynthetic rates and chlorophyll contents were related to the breakage of the chloroplast morphology and ultra-structure. Results of Northern blotting showed that the virulence of 2b protein was associated with high accumulation level of CMV progeny RNAs in systemic leaves. Non-expression of the 2b protein reduced the accumulation levels of its genomic RNAs I and 2. The level of subgenomic RNA4, encoding CP protein, was found to be significantly decreased.",38
"Although various treatments have been used for weight loss to date, obese people rarely have safe and effective treatment options. Therefore, the antiobesity effects of several natural compounds are being actively investigated. This study was conducted to investigate the antiadipogenic effects of Monascus ruber-fermented Fagopyrum esculentum (red yeast buckwheat, RYB) in 3T3-L1 cells. We assessed the intracellular lipid content and adipocyte differentiation by oil red O staining and the expression of genes and proteins associated with adipocyte differentiation by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting in 3T3-L1 cells. RYB dose dependently inhibited 3T3-L1 cell differentiation at concentrations of 50-800 lg/mL, without cytotoxic effects. It also suppressed the expression of adipogenic transcription factors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein a, and adipocytespecific genes, such as adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (aP2), fatty acid synthase, and leptin, during preadipocyte differentiation into adipocytes. Furthermore, RYB reduced cyclin-dependent kinase 2 and cyclin expression and increased p21 and p27 expression, thus causing cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase. Collectively, these results suggest that RYB may be an effective nutraceutical for weight loss as indicated by its ability to suppress adipogenesis-specific gene expression and cause cell cycle arrest at the G1/S interphase.",121
"Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are a type of photovoltaic device that have received widespread attention in recent years. In comparison with silicon photovoltaic cells, DSSCs exhibit some specific advantages including easy fabrication procedures, low manufacturing cost and compatibility with flexible substrates. In spite of the advantages mentioned, from the industrial point of view, the efficiency and the long term stability of the DSSCs system have been subject of concern during the past years of development of this technology. In order to solve these problems, numerous research efforts have been devoted to the engineering and manufacturing of devices that could meet the standards of the photovoltaic cells market for various applications, but the low efficiency and stability have remained as the major challenges in development of DSSCs over the past 25 year. This review focuses on the obstacles and restrictions in the fabrication and commercialization of DSSCs. Losses-in-potential as a limiting efficiency and degradation processes are discussed and external effective factors on the stability of DSSC such as therrhal and light 'soaking stresses, environmental conditions and issues related to the sealing have been investigated in detail. Also, commercial photovoltaic technology of DSSCs in term of efficiency, stability and lifetime is compared to the different types of photovoltaic solar cells. Results indicate that despite the many attractive features of this technology, the transition from laboratory to industry and outdoor applications has been hampered by a number of issues.",100
"Background Headache is common in patients with Moyanoya angiopathy (MMA), but usually underestimated in its management and not well characterized. Methods A validated self-administered headache screening questionnaire and a telephone interview were used in order to investigate headache characteristics, frequency and pain intensity in a large cohort of 55 German patients with MMA. Results Thirty-seven patients (67.3%) had suffered from headache in the past year. Headache intensity was rated 3.21.3 on a verbal rating scale from 0 to 10. Seventeen patients (47.9%) reported migraine-like headache, 10 patients (27.0%) reported tension type-like headache and 10 patients (27.0%) had a combination of both. The majority of patients with migraine-like headache (n=10, 58.8%) described migrainous aura. Headache frequency and intensity improved significantly after revascularization surgery; however, nine patients developed new-onset headache postoperatively. Conclusion Headache is very common in MMA, often with a migraine-like phenotype. Tension type-like headache was also found in 27% of patients, which is a new finding that has not been reported before.",127

"In recent years, the development of composite nanostructures containing noble metal and magnetic nanocrystals has attracted much interest because they offer a promising avenue for multifunctional applications in nanomedicine and pharmacotherapy. In this work, we present a facile two-step hydrothermal approach for the synthesis of bifunctional heterodimer nanoparticles (HDNPs) composed of hematite nanocubes (alpha-Fe2O3 NCs) and silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs). The formation and magnetic property of alpha-Fe2O3-Ag HDNPs was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction and vibrating sample magnetometer. Interestingly, the hydrothermal-synthesized alpha-Fe2O3-Ag HDNPs were found to display significant antibacterial activity against three types of infectious bacteria. The cytotoxicity of alpha-Fe2O3-Ag nanocomposite against lung cancer A549 cell line was investigated and compared with that of pure alpha-Fe2O3 NCs and Ag-NPs. The obtained results reveal that the alpha-Fe2O3-Ag nanocomposite exhibited higher anticancer performance than that of pure Ag-NPs, whereas pure alpha-Fe2O3 NCs were not cytotoxic to the tested cells. The inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the alpha-Fe2O3-Ag nanocomposite was found at 20.94 mu g/mL. With the aforementioned properties, alpha-Fe2O3-Ag HDNPs showed a high potential as a multifunctional material for advanced biomedicine and nanotherapy applications.",14
"This study measured the cerebellar volume of normal male adults in 20s with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and analysed the relationship between cerebellar volume and various psychological parameters. The cerebellar volume of 58 males (mean age, 24.0 +/- 2.8 years) was measured using MRI. The Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90-R) and the Component of Type A Behavior tests were performed. Using linear regression analysis, the relationship between cerebellar volume and psychological parameters was analysed. As phobic anxiety and ambition increased, cerebellar volume of normal male subjects in 20s decreased. This study showed that for even normal male adults, there exists a possible relationship between various psychological parameters and cerebellar volume. (C) 2013 The Authors.

"Although herpesviruses such as cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) can establish lifelong latent infections, little is known about latency conditions in farmed koi populations in China. We used nested polymerase chain reaction targeting the TK gene and an indirect antibody ELISA to screen asymptomatic fish obtained from southern China for evidence of CyHV-3 infection. CyHV-3 DNA could be detected either in peripheral blood leukocytes or from gills of asymptomatic koi. Most koi sera did not contain anti-CyHV-3 antibodies; however, 5 samples were ELISA positive, providing evidence of prior CyHV-3 infections. These findings suggest that koi may survive CyHV-3 infections and become virus carriers.",37
"The small wavelength utilizable range used for determining the optimum performance of photovoltaic and rectenna devices, compared to the broad band spectrum of solar or other heat sources, limits the energy conversion efficiency of such technologies. A selective emitter, with an emissivity profile that matches the receiver's characteristic bandwidth, can be used to improve the overall efficiency of such energy harvesting devices. This paper dompares simulated and experimental results of the design and fabrication of a selective emitter that can be used in the 8-12 mu m frequency range. The matrix transform method is used to calculate the radiative properties of one dimensional metal-dielectric photonic structures. By using genetic algorithm as a powerful optimization tool, the simulated design characteristics of such structure are adjusted to minimize the mean square deviation of the actual spectral emissivity from the target emissivity profile. Specifically, this paper presents and compares results of the simulated design and fabrication of selective emitters composed of alternating layers of Al2O3-SiO2 or Al2O3-SiC on an aluminum substrate. The output radiation of these selective emitters could be used as the input radiation to high efficiency rectenna devices.",100
"In the course of the last decade, fast and qualitative computing power developments have undoubtedly permitted for a better and more realistic modeling of complex physiological processes. Due to this favorable environment, a fast, generic and reliable model for high density surface electromyographic (HD-sEMG) signal generation with a multilayered cylindrical description of the volume conductor is presented in this study. Its main peculiarity lies in the generation of a high resolution potential map over the skin related to active Motor Units (MUs). Indeed, the analytical calculus is fully performed in the frequency domain. HD-sEMG signals are obtained by surfacic numerical integration of the generated high resolution potential map following a variety of electrode shapes. The suggested model is implemented using parallel computing techniques as well as by using an object-oriented approach which is comprehensive enough to be fairly quickly understood, used and potentially upgraded. To illustrate the model abilities, several simulation analyses are put forward in the results section. These simulations have been performed on the same muscle anatomy while varying the number of processes in order to show significant speed improvement. Accuracy of the numerical integration method, illustrating electrode shape diversity, is also investigated in comparison to analytical transfer functions definition. An additional section provides an insight on the volume detection of a circular electrode according to its radius. Furthermore, a large scale simulation is introduced with 300 MUs in the muscle and a HD-sEMG electrode grid composed of 16 x 16 electrodes for three constant isometric contractions in 12 s. Finally, advantages and limitations of the proposed model are discussed with a focus on perspective works. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",101
"Adolescent and young mothers transitioning from pregnancy to postpartum need to maintain an optimal quality of life. Stress and exposure to violence (e.g., intimate partner violence (IPV), nonpartner violence) are predictors of poor quality of life for adult women; however, these associations remain understudied among adolescent and young mothers in urban areas. Guided by the social ecological model, the current study created a latent variable, urban social stress, to examine the impact of the urban social environment (i.e., stressful life events, discrimination, family stress, and neighborhood problems) on the quality of life of adolescent and young mothers during both pregnancy and postpartum. The current study is a secondary data analysis of a prospective cohort study of 296 expectant young mothers recruited at obstetrics and gynecology clinics. Results from structural equation and multigroup models found that higher urban social stress predicted lower mental and physical quality of life during pregnancy, but these associations were significantly stronger for IPV-exposed and nonpartner violence-exposed mothers. In the postpartum period, higher urban social stress predicted lower mental and physical quality of life, but these associations were significantly stronger for IPV-unexposed and nonpartner violence-exposed mothers. Stress reduction programs need to help adolescent and young mothers in urban areas develop stress management skills specific to urban social stress. Pregnancy and parenting programs need to be tailored to the specific needs of young mothers in urban areas by becoming sensitive to the role of IPV and nonpartner violence in these young women's lives.",29

Laryngeal sensory testing was performed in 54 adolescents and young adults with EILO. Laryngeal mucosal alterations were assessed according to the Reflux Finding Score (RFS). The data concerning diseases possibly affecting the upper airway, findings of previously performed flexible videolaryngoscopy during exercise, and RFS score were compared between the participants with laryngeal hyposensitivity and those with normal sensitivity. The participants with isolated vocal folds' adduction during an EILO attack were compared with those who demonstrated supraglottis collapse. Testing revealed an increased threshold for mechanical stimuli in 81.5% of participants. Among participants with hyposensitivity, there were significantly more participants with dysphagia during EILO attacks than among the participants with normal laryngeal sensitivity. The hyposensitivity group had a significantly higher RFS score compared with the other group. Isolated vocal folds' approximation was only observed in 11.9% of participants. These participants were younger and had asthma more frequently compared with the others. Only 16.9% of participants with EILO did not state symptoms related to gastroesophageal reflux. The decreased mechanosensitivity was detected in the majority of participants, suggesting that laryngopharyngeal reflux can be an important etiological factor. The problem of breathing difficulties during sport activities in youth can also be associated with the disproportionate growth of the respiratory tract. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Polyols are hydrogenated carbohydrates used as sugar replacers. Interest now arises because of their multiple potential health benefits. They are non-cariogenic (sugar-free tooth-friendly), low-glycaemic (potentially helpful in diabetes and cardiovascular disease), low-energy and low-insulinaemic (potentially helpful in obesity), low-digestible (potentially helpful in the colon), osmotic (colon-hydrating, laxative and purifying) carbohydrates. Such potential health benefits are reviewed. A major focus here is the glycaemic index (GI) of polyols as regards the health implications of low-GI foods. The literature on glycaemia and insulinaemia after polyol ingestion was analysed and expressed in the GI and insulinaemic index (II) modes, which yielded the values: erythritol 0, 2; xylitol 13, 11; sorbitol 9, 11; mannitol 0, 0; maltitol 35, 27; isomalt 9, 6; lactitol 6, 4; polyglycitol 39, 23. These values are all much lower than sucrose 65, 43 or glucose 100, 100. GI values on replacing sucrose were independent of both intake (up to 50 g) and the state of carbohydrate metabolism (normal, type I with artificial pancreas and type 2 diabetes mellitus). The assignment of foods and polyols to GI bands is considered, these being: high (>70), intermediate (>55-70), low (>40-55), and very low (< 40) including non-glycaemic; the last aims to target particularly low-GI-carbohydrate-based foods. Polyols ranged from low to very low GI. An examination was made of the dietary factors affecting the GI of polyols and foods. Polyol and other food GI values could be used to estimate the GI of food mixtures containing polyols without underestimation. Among foods and polyols a departure of II from GI was observed due to fat elevating II and reducing GI. Fat exerted an additional negative influence on GI, presumed due to reduced rates of gastric emptying. Among the foods examined, the interaction was prominent with snack foods; this potentially damaging insulinaemia could be reduced using polyols. Improved glycated haemoglobin as a marker of glycaemic control was found in a 12-week study of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients consuming polyol, adding to other studies showing improved glucose control on ingestion of low-GI carbohydrate. In general some improvement in long-term glycaemic control was discernible on reducing the glycaemic load via GI by as little as 15-20 g daily. Similar amounts of polyols are normally acceptable. Although polyols are not essential nutrients, they contribute to clinically recognised maintenance of a healthy colonic environment and function. A role for polyols and polyol foods to hydrate the colonic contents and aid laxation is now recognised by physicians. Polyols favour saccharolytic anaerobes and aciduric organisms in the colon, purifying the colon of endotoxic, putrefying and pathological organisms, which has clinical relevance. Polyols also contribute towards short-chain organic acid formation for a healthy colonic epithelium. Polyol tooth-friendliness and reduced energy values are affirmed and add to the potential benefits. In regard to gastrointestinal tolerance, food scientists and nutritionists, physicians, and dentists have in their independent professional capacities each now described sensible approaches to the use and consumption of polyols.",122
"Given immunity's general role in the organism's economy-both in terms of its internal environment as well as mediating its external relations-immune theory has expanded its traditional formulation of preserving individual autonomy to one that includes accounting for nutritional processes and symbiotic relationships that require immune tolerance. When such a full ecological alignment is adopted, the immune system becomes the mediator of both defensive and assimilative environmental intercourse, where a balance of immune rejection and tolerance governs the complex interactions of the organism's ecological relationships. Accordingly, immunology, which historically had affiliated with the biology of individuals, now becomes a science concerned with the biology of communities. With this translocation, the ontological basis of the organism is undergoing a profound change. Indeed, the recent recognition of the ubiquity of symbiosis has challenged the traditional notions of biological individuality and requires a shift in the metaphysics undergirding biology, in which a philosophy of the organism must be characterized by ecological dialectics ""all-the-way-down."".",33

"This study examines the effects of chronic (i.e., repeated and cumulative) mediated exposure to political violence on ideological beliefs regarding political conflict. It centers on these effects on young viewers, from preadolescents to adolescents. Ideological beliefs refers here to support of war, perception of threat to one's nation, and normative beliefs concerning aggression toward the out-group. A longitudinal study was conducted on a sample of Israeli and Palestinian youths who experience the Israeli-Palestinian conflict firsthand (N = 1,207). Two alternative hypotheses were tested: that chronic exposure via the media increases support for war and aggression and elevates feeling of threat, or that chronic exposure via the media strengthens preexisting beliefs. Results demonstrated that higher levels of exposure were longitudinally related to stronger support for war. Regarding normative beliefs about aggression and threat to one's nation, mediated exposure reinforced initial beliefs, rendering the youths more extreme in their attitudes. These results mostly support the conceptualization of the relation between media violence and behaviors as reciprocally determined or reinforcing spirals. The results are also discussed in light of the differences found between the effect of exposure to political violence firsthand and exposure via the media.",74
"Background: Advancements in research and clinical care have considerably extended the life expectancy of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. However, with this extended survival come comorbidities. One of the leading co-morbidities is CF-related bone disease (CFBD), which progresses with disease severity and places patients at high risk for fractures, particularly of the ribs and vertebrae. Evidence that CF patients with vertebral fractures had higher bone mineral density (BMD) than the nonfracture group led us to postulate that bone quality is impaired in these patients. We therefore examined rib specimens resected at the time of lung transplant in CF patients to measure parameters of bone quantity and quality. Methods: In this exploratory study, we analysed 19 end-stage CF and 13 control rib specimens resected from otherwise healthy lung donors. BMD, bone microarchitecture, static parameters of bone formation and resorption and microcrack density of rib specimens were quantified by imaging, histomorphometric and histological methods. Variables reflecting the mineralization of ribs were assessed by digitized microradiography. The degree of bone mineralization (g/cm(3)) and the heterogeneity index of the mineralization (g/cm(3)) were calculated for trabecular and cortical bone. Results: Compared to controls, CF ribs exhibited lower areal and trabecular volumetric BMD, decreased trabecular thickness and osteoid parameters, and increased microcrack density, that was particularly pronounced in specimens from patients with CF-related diabetes. Static parameters of bone resorption were similar in both groups. Degree of mineralization of total bone, but not heterogeneity index, was increased in CF specimens. Conclusion: The combination of reduced bone mass, altered microarchitecture, imbalanced bone remodeling (maintained bone resorption but decreased formation), increased microdamage and a small increase of the degree of mineralization, may lead to decreased bone strength, which, when coupled with chronic coughing and chest physical therapy, may provide an explanation for the increased incidence of rib fractures previously reported in this population. 2017 Elsevier Inc.

"The patella is a sesamoid bone located in the major extensor tendon of the knee joint, in the hindlimb of many tetrapods. Although numerous aspects of knee morphology are ancient and conserved among most tetrapods, the evolutionary occurrence of an ossified patella is highly variable. Among extant (crown clade) groups it is found in most birds, most lizards, the monotreme mammals and almost all placental mammals, but it is absent in most marsupial mammals as well as many reptiles. Here, we integrate data from the literature and first-hand studies of fossil and recent skeletal remains to reconstruct the evolution of the mammalian patella. We infer that bony patellae most likely evolved between four and six times in crown group Mammalia: in monotremes, in the extinct multituberculates, in one or more stem-mammal genera outside of therian or eutherian mammals and up to three times in therian mammals. Furthermore, an ossified patella was lost several times in mammals, not including those with absent hindlimbs: once or more in marsupials (with some re-acquisition) and at least once in bats. Our inferences about patellar evolution in mammals are reciprocally informed by the existence of several human genetic conditions in which the patella is either absent or severely reduced. Clearly, development of the patella is under close genomic control, although its responsiveness to its mechanical environment is also important (and perhaps variable among taxa). Where a bony patella is present it plays an important role in hindlimb function, especially in resisting gravity by providing an enhanced lever system for the knee joint. Yet the evolutionary origins, persistence and modifications of a patella in diverse groups with widely varying habits and habitats-from digging to running to aquatic, small or large body sizes, bipeds or quadrupeds-remain complex and perplexing, impeding a conclusive synthesis of form, function, development and genetics across mammalian evolution. This meta-analysis takes an initial step toward such a synthesis by collating available data and elucidating areas of promising future inquiry.",34
"Psychotherapeutic genetic counseling is an increasingly relevant practice description. In this paper we aim to demonstrate how psychotherapeutic genetic counseling can be achieved by using psychological theories to guide one's approach to working with clients. We describe two illustrative examples, fuzzy trace theory and cognitive behavior theory, and apply them to two challenging cases. The theories were partially derived from evidence of beneficial client outcomes using a psychotherapeutic approach to patient care in other settings. We aim to demonstrate how these two specific theories can inform psychotherapeutic genetic counseling practice, and use them as examples of how to take a psychological theory and effectively apply it to genetic counseling.",34
"During prenatal development, a large number of different cell types are formed, the vast majority of which contain identical genetic material. The basis of the great variety in cell phenotype and function is the differential expression of the approximately 25,000 genes in the mammalian genome. Transcriptional activity is regulated at many levels by proteins, including members of the basal transcriptional apparatus, DNA-binding transcription factors, and chromatin-binding proteins. Importantly, chromatin structure dictates the availability of a specific genomic locus for transcriptional activation as well as the efficiency, with which transcription can occur. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a method to assess if chromatin modifications or proteins arc present at a specific locus. ChIP involves the cross linking of DNA and associated proteins and immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies to DNA-associated proteins followed by examination of the co-precipitated DNA sequences or proteins. In the last few years, ChIP has become an essential technique for scientists studying transcriptional regulation and chromatin structure. Using ChIP on mouse embryos, we can document the presence or absence of specific proteins and chromatin modifications at genomic loci in vivo during mammalian development. Here, we describe a ChIP technique adapted for mouse embryos.",75
"Pro-active message's delay tolerant networks (DTNs) are based on the usage of mobile code to obtain messages that contain their own routing code. This architecture allows applications to use the same network in different ways. The keystone of this type of heterogeneous network is a collection of contextual and application-related information that it is stored in every node and accessed by the messages' routing code. Access to that information must be protected in order to make the whole architecture feasible; the operation of the network has to be secure, and attacks of information poisoning have to be avoided. We propose an identity-based access control system for pro-active message's DTN based on tools that are available in DTN networks, like symmetric key encryption and hashes. Our system grants confidentiality and integrity to the contextual information and solves the question of messages needing to use distributed information stored in nodes to route properly. The proof of concept of identity-based access control in a certain kind of application demonstrates the feasibility of the proposal. The comparison between our proposal and other access control systems shows that identity-based access control is the only system that fits well with the special characteristics of pro-active message's DTN.

"Reverse micelles system is suggested as a direct tool to study the influence of membrane matrix composition on the activity and structure of membrane-associated enzymes with the use of acid phosphatase (AP) as an example. In reverse micelles the functioning of the monomeric and dimeric forms of AP could be separately observed by variation of the size of the micelles. We found that including the lipids into the micellar system can dramatically affect the enzyme functioning even at low lipid content (2% w/w), and this effect depends on the lipid nature. Structural studies using CD spectroscopy and DLS methods have shown that the influence of lipid composition on the enzyme properties might be caused by the interaction of lipids with the enzyme as well as by the influence of lipids on structure and properties of the micellar matrix.

"Direct income supports have long been known to substantially reduce the extent and depth of poverty. Evidence suggests that they can also bolster children's opportunities to succeed and enhance long-term mobility. A growing body of research, for example, links income from 2 related tax credits for working families the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit to benefits for children in those families, such as improved birth weight, better school outcomes, and increased rates of employment in adulthood. Similarly, the introduction of food stamps has been found to improve not only the birth weight of infants given access to the program but also their educational achievement, as well as indicators of health, wellbeing, and self-sufficiency decades later. These are striking research results for income support that is not typically thought of as improving children's health or education. The mechanisms through which these income supports lead to such benefits are likely varied and complex, but emerging research suggests that helping families with children afford basic necessities can reduce the added stress of financial difficulties, preventing downstream neuroendocrine and biochemical changes that affect children's longer-term outcomes. These findings have important implications for policy makers. Research suggests that potential weakening of the safety net would not only substantially increase poverty, but also have damaging long-term effects on children. Policy makers should reject funding cuts and instead strengthen the safety net, which this analysis suggests could reduce poverty further and also enhance children's opportunities to succeed.",117
"This paper aims to indicate the relationships between women and work through observation of ""Almanachs de Pelotas"", taking specific elements of analysis as its texts, photographs and ads. The aforementioned publication, edited annually, circulated in Pelotas between the years 1913 and 1935, with the main objective to divulge the modern progress of the city. As are woven observations of female work promulgated by the before cited elements, it can also be suggested that the delimitation of the periodic's public was mainly the male and more conservative, which may explain the discourses around the ideal of women as housewives and, in cases of outside home work, with limits based on assignments of gender roles. It discusses, through this text, the historical invisibility of women, an issue that, if on one hand is notorious in the Almanachs, paradoxically, is the visibility afforded by them that enable the analysis of possible works for those women. Hence the title of the article placed in a dubious way about the fact that the periodical consideres or not these issues.",77
"We here report identification and characterization of Required for Cell Differentiation I homolog (RQCD1) as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer. Gene-expression profiling analysis of breast cancer cells, semi-quantitative RT-PCR, Northern blotting and Western blotting confirmed RQCD1 to be frequently up-regulated in breast cancer specimens and breast cancer cell lines. On the other hand, its expression was very weak or hardly detectable in normal human tissues except testis, indicating this molecule to be a novel cancer-testis antigen. Treatment of breast cancer cell lines with siRNA targeting RQCD1 drastically suppressed cell proliferation. Concordantly, introduction of exogenous RQCD1 into HEK293 cells significantly enhanced cell growth, implying RQCD1 to have an oncogenic activity. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments and immunocytochemical staining revealed an interaction of RQCD1 protein with Grb10 interacting GYF protein I (GIGYF1) and 2 (GIGYF2) proteins, involved in regulation of Akt activation, in breast cancer cells. Interestingly, knockdown of either of RQCD1, GIGYF1 or GIGYF2 resulted in significant reduction of the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser 473 in breast cancer cell lines. Our findings suggest that RQCD1 is a potential molecular target for treatment of breast cancer.",38
"Humans diagnosed with alcohol use disorder are more sensitive to painful stimuli during withdrawal, which suggests that excessive alcohol drinking worsens pain outcomes. Alcohol-dependent rats exhibit increases in nociceptive sensitivity during withdrawal. Data from animal models suggest that brain melanocortin-4 receptors (MC4Rs) mediate alcohol drinking and nociception. Here we tested: (1) the effect of alcohol dependence on thermal nociception in rats, and (2) the ability of acute alcohol and (3) MC4R antagonists to reverse hyperalgesia during withdrawal in alcohol-dependent rats. Rats were trained to self-administer operant alcohol and were tested for baseline thermal nociception. Half of the rats were made dependent on alcohol, then all rats were cannulated in the lateral ventricle. We tested the effects of acute alcohol drinking, acute fixed-dose alcohol, intra-ventricular agouti-related protein (endogenous MC4R antagonist), intra-ventricular HS014 (synthetic MC4R antagonist) and intra-nasal HS014 on hyperalgesia during withdrawal in alcohol-dependent rats, relative to non-dependent drinkers and alcohol-naive controls. Alcohol-dependent rats exhibit thermal hyperalgesia that is abolished by alcohol drinking, bolus alcohol and intra-ventricular and intra-nasal MC4R antagonists. These manipulations did not affect thermal nociception in non-dependent drinkers and alcohol-naive controls, suggesting that alcohol dependence produces neuroadaptations in brain MC4R systems. These results suggest that brain MC4R systems may be an effective therapeutic target for reducing nociception in the alcohol-dependent organism.",108
"Open-loop unstable systems with time-delays are often encountered in process industry, which are often more difficult to control than stable processes. In this paper, the stabilization by PID controller of second order unstable processes, which can be represented as second-order deadtime with an unstable pole (SODUP) and second-order deadtime with two unstable poles (SODTUP), is performed via the necessary and sufficient criteria of Routh-Hurwitz stability analysis. The stability analysis provides improved understanding on the existence of a stabilizing range of each PID parameter. Three simple PID tuning algorithms are proposed to provide desired closed-loop performance-robustness within the stable regions of controller parameters obtained via the stability analysis. The proposed PID controllers show improved performance over those derived via some existing methods. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of ISA.",59

"Background: Cow's milk, hen's egg and wheat are staple foods in a typical western diet. Despite the ubiquity of these foods, the impact of staple food allergy on health-related quality of life (HRQL) amongst adolescents is incompletely understood. The aims of this study were to make use of the Swedish version of EuroPrevall's disease-specific food allergy quality of life questionnaire-teenager form (FAQLQ-TF) and to investigate the association between objectively-diagnosed staple food allergy and HRQL amongst adolescents. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 58 adolescents aged 13-17 years [n = 40 (69 %) boys] with objectively-diagnosed allergy to the staple foods cow's milk, hen's egg and/or wheat and living in Stockholm, Sweden were included. Adolescents completed the FAQLQ-TF, which has a corresponding scale of 1 = best HRQL, and 7 = worst HRQL. Overall HRQL and domain-specific HRQL were established. Adolescents also reported symptoms, adrenaline auto injector (AAI) prescription and presence of other food allergies. A history of anaphylaxis was defined among those reporting difficulty breathing, inability to stand/collapse, and/or loss of consciousness. Clinically different HRQL was set at a mean difference of >= 0.5. Results: Overall mean HRQL was poorer than average [mean: 4.70/7.00 (95 % CI 4.30-5.01)]. The domain risk of accidental exposure was significantly associated with clinically better HRQL than the domain allergen avoidance and dietary restrictions (mean difference = 0.76; p < 0.001). Girls had clinically worse, but not statistically significantly different mean HRQL than boys (mean difference = 0.71; p < 0.07). HRQL tended to be worse amongst those with allergies to more than three foods or an AAI prescription. The number and types of symptoms, including a history of anaphylaxis were not associated with worse HRQL. Conclusions: As ascertained via a food allergy-specific questionnaire, adolescents with staple food allergy report poorer than average HRQL, specifically in relation to emerging independence and the need for support. Girls have clinically worse HRQL than boys. The number and type of previous symptoms and history of anaphylaxis were not associated with worse HRQL.",105
"Optical sensors are powerful tools for live cell research as they permit to follow the location, concentration changes or activities of key cellular players such as lipids, ions and enzymes. Most of the current sensor probes are based on fluorescence which provides great spatial and temporal precision provided that high-end microscopy is used and that the timescale of the event of interest fits the response time of the sensor. Many of the sensors developed in the past 20 years are genetically encoded. There is a diversity of designs leading to simple or sometimes complicated applications for the use in live cells. Genetically encoded sensors began to emerge after the discovery of fluorescent proteins, engineering of their improved optical properties and the manipulation of their structure through application of circular permutation. In this review, we will describe a variety of genetically encoded biosensor concepts, including those for intensiometric and ratiometric sensors based on single fluorescent proteins, Forster resonance energy transfer-based sensors, sensors utilising bioluminescence, sensors using self-labelling SNAP- and CLIP-tags, and finally tetracysteine-based sensors. We focus on the newer developments and discuss the current approaches and techniques for design and application. This will demonstrate the power of using optical sensors in cell biology and will help opening the field to more systematic applications in the future.",31
"The paper discusses and compares different abstract state-space representations for a class of linear hyperbolic systems defined on a one-dimensional spatial domain. It starts with their PDE representation in both weakly and strongly coupled forms. Next, the homogeneous state equation including the unbounded formal state operator is presented. Based on the semigroup approach, some results of well-posedness and internal stability are given. The boundary and observation operators are introduced, assuming a typical configuration of boundary inputs as well as pointwise observations of the state variables. Consequently, the homogeneous state equation is extended to the so-called boundary control state/signal form. Next, the classical additive state-space representation involving (A, B, C)-triple of state, input and output operators is considered. After short discussion on the appropriate Hilbert spaces, state-space equation in the so-called factor form is also presented. Finally, the resolvent of the system state operator A is discussed.",58
"In patients with Philadelphia-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), the anti-thrombotic and/or cytoreductive treatment in the follow-up may affect the evaluation of the pro-thrombotic weight of the clinical and biological characteristics at diagnosis. In order to avoid this potential confounding effect, we investigated the relationship between prior thrombosis (PrTh: thrombosis occurred before diagnosis and before treatment) and the characteristics at diagnosis in 977 thrombocythemic patients with MPN, reclassified according to the WHO 2008 criteria. PrTh occurred in 194 (19.9%) patients, with similar rates in the different MPNs. In multivariate analysis, PrTh rate was significantly related to minor thrombocytosis (platelets10 x 10(9)/L), higher hematocrit (HCT >45%), JAK2 V617F mutation, older age, and cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs). The highest PrTh rate (33.9%) was associated with the coexistence of minor thrombocytosis and leukocytosis. Of note, the inverse relationship between PrTh rate and platelet count is consistent with the hemostatic paradox of thrombocytosis. In conclusion, this analysis in MPN patients disclosed the unbiased characteristics at diagnosis with a pro-thrombotic effect. Moreover, it suggests that the optimal control of blood cells counts, and CVRFs might be of utmost importance in the prevention of thrombosis during the follow-up. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"ARINC 653 provides a strong isolation mechanism for safety computing fields, such as aircrafts. seL4, a 3rd generation microkernel, was formally verified for its functional correctness and provides a desirable code base for partitioning operating systems. But there is a long way from seL4 to partitioning. We take the first step and focus on the temporal aspect, i.e., implementing a partitioned scheduler based on seL4. However, seL4 implements a stiff scheduler inside the kernel, which conflicts with the genera principles(eg. ARINC 653 standard) of temporal partitioning. To address this problem, we propose a user-mode approach. We also elaborate performance of our scheduler.",68
"OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to determine the prevalence and etiology of erectile dysfunction in Saudi type 2 diabetic patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 429 Saudi type 2 diabetic male patients aged more than 30 years were recruited. Total and bio-available serum testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin and free testosterone levels were measured by ELISA-IBL GMBH Germany. RESULTS: 47 ( 12.6%) subjects had hypogonadism with total testosterone < 8 nmol/l and 109 (29.3%) had possible hypogonadism with a total testosterone between 8 and 12 nmol/l. Similarly, using bioavailable levels, 30 (8%) men had overt hypogonadism with bioavailable testosterone < 2.5 nmol/l and 89 (33.9%) men had possible hypogonadism with bioavailable testosterone between 2.5-4 nmol/l; while 266 (71.6%) patients with free testosterone < 0.255 nmol/l had hypogonadism. BMI and waist circumference were both significantly negatively correlated with testosterone levels in Saudi type 2 diabetic men. CONCLUSIONS: Testosterone levels are frequently low in Saudi men with type 2 diabetes and majority of these patients have symptoms of hypogonadism. The prevalence of erectile dysfunction (ED) was 86.7% in diabetic men with low testosterone level of 8-12 nmol/L. Obesity is an associated factor with low testosterone levels and ED in Saudi type 2 diabetic patients.",6
"Thyroid hormones are vital in the control of multiple body functions, including the correct performance of the brain. Multiple diseases are associated with thyroid gland functioning, including hypothyroidism. To date, little is known regarding the effects of the establishment of this condition at a young age on brain function. Here, we evaluated the effect of hypothyroidism in an early postnatal stage in cognitive abilities with focus on the hippocampus. In our model, hypothyroidism was induced in young rats at 21 days of age using 0.05% 6-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU) for 4 weeks reaching significantly lower levels of fT(4) (control: 1.337 ng/dL +/- 0.115, PTU: 0.050 ng/dL +/- 0.001). Following the induction of hypothyroidism, several cognitive tasks were assessed to investigate the effects of hypothyroidism on cognition performance. We determined that hypothyroidism triggers a significant dysfunction in learning and memory processes observed in the Morris Water Maze were the latency times were higher in PTU rats (controls: 37 s; PTU: 57 s). The cognitive impairment was correlated with a reduction in hippocampal plasticity with respect to both long-term potentiation (LTP) (control: 1.45, PTU: 1.00) and depression (LTD) (control: 0.71, PTU: 1.01). Furthermore, a decrease in the rate of glucose utilization (control: 223 nmol * mg of protein, PTU:148 nmol * mg of protein) was observed, along with an increase in oxidative stress and a decrease in MAP2 marker in the hippocampus. Our findings suggest that the induction of hypothyroidism in a young rat model alters numerous functions at the level of the hippocampus. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.",133
"The surface tension (gamma) of 1-dimethylamino-2-propanol (DMA2P), DMA2P-monoethanolamine (MEA), and DMA2P-piperazine (PZ) aqueous solutions was measured by using the BZY-1 surface tension meter. The temperature ranged from 303.2 K to 323.2 K. The mass fractions of DMA2P, MEA and PZ respectively ranged from 030 to 0.50, 0.05 to 0.15 and 0.025 to 0.075. An equation was proposed to model the surface tension and the calculated results agreed well with the experiments. The surface thermodynamics including surface enthalpy and surface entropy were determined and their concentration dependence was analysed. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",88
"Purpose: To determine exposure of young adolescents to extremely violent movies. Design: Cross-sectional school-based survey of middle school students at 15 randomly selected New Hampshire and Vermont middle schools. Each survey contained a unique list of 50 movies, randomly selected from 603 top box office hits from 1988 to 1999, 51 of which were determined by content analysis to contain extremely violent material. Movie titles only were listed, and adolescents were asked to indicate which ones they had seen. Each movie appeared on approximately 470 surveys. We calculated the percentage of students who had seen each movie for a representative subsample of the student population. We also examined characteristics associated with seeing at least one extremely violent movie. Complete survey information was obtained from 5456 students. The sample was primarily white and equally distributed by gender. Results: On average, extremely violent movies were seen by 28% of the students in the sample (range 4% to 66%). The most popular movie, Scream, was seen by two-thirds of students overall and over 40% of fifth-graders. Other movies with sexualized violent content were seen by many of these adolescents. Examples include The General's Daughter (rated R for ""graphic images related to sexual violence including a rape scene and perverse sexuality"") and Natural Born Killers (rated R for extreme violence and graphic carnage, shocking images, language, and sexuality""), seen by 27% and 20%, respectively. Older students, males, those of lower socioeconomic status, and those with poorer school performance were all significantly more likely to have seen at least one extremely violent movie. Conclusion: This study documents widespread exposure of young adolescents to movies with brutal, and often sexualized, violence. Given that many of these films were marketed to teens, better oversight of the marketing practices of the film industry may be warranted. (C) Society for Adolescent Medicine, 2002.",74
"Since communal violence erupted in Myanmar's Rakhine State in 2012 between Buddhist and Muslim communities, the plight of the Rohingya Muslims has received much media attention both inside and outside of the country. Rarely, however, do we get critical analyses of how such reporting is constructed. Research on communal conflict and journalism tends to focus on the how-to of conflict-sensitive reporting and the dangers of employing local fixers and interpreters whose influence is seen to reduce the objectivity of news, rather than on the actual news gathering strategies used in specific conflicts. Based on personal observations of a freelance reporter in Myanmar, and interviews with journalists and fixers working in the country, this article analyses the news production processes in reporting on the conflict. The article maps out the various actors involved in the production of news, such as foreign and local journalists, local producers (the fixers) and interpreters, and the various challenges and limitations they face. These challenges function to perpetuate a familiar set of reporting routines and us vs them or binary narratives, with consequences for the de-escalation or perpetuation of the conflict.",80
"Human body and head lice are highly related haematophagous ectoparasites but only the body louse has been shown to transmit Bartonella quintana, the causative agent of trench fever. The mechanisms by which body lice became a vector for B. quintana, however, are poorly understood. Following oral challenge, green fluorescent protein-expressing B. quintana proliferated over 9 days postchallenge with the number of bacteria being significantly higher in whole body vs. head lice. The numbers of B. quintana detected in faeces from infected lice, however, were approximately the same in both lice. Nevertheless, the viability of B. quintana was significantly higher in body louse faeces. Comparison of immune responses in alimentary tract tissues revealed that basal transcription levels of peptidoglycan recognition protein and defensins were lower in body lice and the transcription of defensin 1 was up-regulated by oral challenge with wild-type B. quintana in head but not in body lice. In addition, the level of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species generated by epithelial cells was significantly lower in body lice. Although speculative at this time, the reduced immune response is consistent with the higher vector competence seen in body vs. head lice in terms of B. quintana infection.",34
"The present research examined how messages advocating different intergroup ideologies affect outcomes relevant to minority group members' ability to exert power in exchanges with dominant group members. We expected that salient multiculturalism would have positive implications for minority group members' feelings of power by virtue of highlighting essential contributions they make to society, and that no such empowering effect would be evident for them in connection with alternative ideologies such as color-blindness or for dominant group members. Results across four studies involving different participant populations, operationalizations of ideology, ethnic minority groups, and experimental settings were consistent with these hypotheses and further indicated that the effects of salient multiculturalism on feelings of power had downstream implications for expectations of control in an ostensibly upcoming intergroup interaction and general goal-directed cognition.",61

"The article presents a meta-analysis of studies-yielding 26 independent samples of subjects-on the relationship between exposure to media violence and violent aggression. Mean effect sizes from aggregate and experimental studies do not suggest that media violence and criminal aggression are positively associated, but findings from prospective longitudinal studies are more ambiguous. Summary statistics based on models strictly conforming to each study's original design were compared to post hoc models (in which measures or model specification were not consistent with the original description). Overall, ""original"" models, controlling for ""trait,"" did not suggest that exposure to media violence is associated with criminal aggression. The summary statistic for boys reached statistical significance, but the effect size was small, and conclusions based on this finding are attenuated because of known biases in the coefficients estimated.",74
"Background: In 2002, Moseley et al published a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that showed no difference between knee arthroscopy and placebo for patients with osteoarthritis (OA). We wanted to assess the impact of the trial on clinical practice in the United States. Purpose/Hypothesis:To evaluate changes in knee arthroscopy practice before and after publication of the article by Moseley et al and to assess the effect of this landmark RCT on the behavior of practicing orthopaedic surgeons. We hypothesized that after publication of the Moseley trial, the overall frequency of knee arthroscopy would decrease, that the mean age of patients undergoing knee arthroscopy would decrease, and that the proportion of arthroscopies for a diagnosis of OA would decrease. Study Design:Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods:The State Ambulatory Surgery Database was used to analyze cases from 1998 to 2006, which were classified as meniscus tear, OA, or OA with meniscus tear. Changes in age, surgery rates, and case classification were evaluated before and after Moseley's trial using Student t tests and analysis of variance. Results:After publication of the trial, the number of knee arthroscopies per year increased from 155,057 in 1998 to 172,317 in 2006 (P < .001). Mean patient age increased from 47.6 to 49.2 years (P <= .001). Meniscus tears increased from 69.1% to 70.8%, representing approximately 15,500 additional cases per year. OA decreased from 10.6% to 7.2%, representing approximately 4000 fewer cases per year. OA with meniscus tear increased from 20.3% to 22.0%, representing approximately 6400 additional cases per year. Conclusion:While overall age and rates of knee arthroscopy increased contrary to our hypothesis, we identified a decrease in rates of knee arthroscopy for OA after publication of the Moseley trial, demonstrating that well-publicized RCTs can influence patterns of clinical practice.",15
"We previously showed that coincident exposure to heat shock (HS; 42 degrees C for 2 h) and TNF-alpha synergistically induces apoptosis in mouse lung epithelium. We extended this work by analyzing HS effects on human lung epithelial responses to clinically relevant injury. Cotreatment with TNF-alpha and HS induced little caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage in human small airway epithelial cells, A549 cells, and BEAS2B cells. Scratch wound closure rates almost doubled when A549 and BEAS2B cells and air-liquid interface cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells were heat shocked immediately after wounding. Microarray, qRT-PCR, and immunoblotting showed fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) to be synergistically induced by HS and wounding. Enhanced FGF1 expression in HS/wounded A549 was blocked by inhibitors of p38 MAPK (SB203580) or HS factor (HSF)-1 (KNK-437) and in HSF1 knockout BEAS2B cells. PCR demonstrated FGF1 to be expressed from the two most distal promoters in wounded/HS cells. Wound closure in HS A549 and BEAS2B cells was reduced by FGF receptor-1/3 inhibition (SU-5402) or FGF1 depletion. Exogenous FGF1 accelerated A549 wound closure in the absence but not presence of HS. In the presence of exogenous FGF1, HS slowed wound closure, suggesting that it increases FGF1 expression but impairs FGF1-stimulated wound closure. Frozen sections from normal and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) lung were analyzed for FGF1 and HSP70 by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and qRT-PCR. FGF1 and HSP70 mRNA levels were 7.5 and 5.9-fold higher in IPF than normal lung, and the proteins colocalized to fibroblastic foci in IPF lung. We conclude that HS signaling may have an important impact on gene expression contributing to lung injury, healing, and fibrosis.",3
"The goal of this research was to develop and psychometrically evaluate the Portuguese version of the Revised Peer Experience Questionnaire, which assesses aggression, victimization and prosocial behavior. Victimization and aggression among adolescents in school settings is a growing problem, not yet fully understood or properly evaluated, particularly in Portugal. A sample of 1320 adolescents was recruited (52.7% female), with ages varying from 10 to 18 years old, attending middle and high school. Confirmatory factor analysis confirms the measurement model of the instrument's bully and victim versions, as evaluating overt, relational, and reputational aggression/ victimization and providing/ receiving prosocial behavior, respectively. This measurement model was invariant across schooling and gender, showed adequate internal consistency indicators, and presented evidence for construct validity in relation to other variables. Descriptive analyses indicate that boys are more aggressive in overt and relational forms and victimized through overt aggression, whereas girls are more aggressive and victimized relationally. More than any form of aggression or victimization, boys and girls revealed higher values for engaging in and receiving prosocial behavior. These results suggest that this instrument is a reliable, valid, and structurally sound measure of aggression, victimization and prosocial behavior in this Portuguese school- based community sample. Hence, its use may assist researchers in gaining a better understanding of adolescent aggression and victimization.",65
"Introduction: Burn Wound Infection (BWI) is primarily caused by aerobic bacteria followed by fungi, anaerobes and viruses. There has been a worldwide decrease in incidence of bacterial infections in burns due to better patient care and availability of effective antibiotics. Consequently, the fungal burn wound infection has shown an increasing trend. Aim: The aim of study was to assess the frequency of fungal infections in thermal burn wounds with respect to age of wounds, total body surface involved, depth of burns and to assess common fungal pathogens. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted on 50 patients admitted with thermal burn wounds having 20-60% burns in the surgical unit. Pus swab and scrapings were taken under local anaesthesia from each burn patient. Scrapings were put in a sterile container and sent to Mycology section of Microbiology department and were examined by direct microscopy and culture studies on Sabouraud's Dextrose Agar medium in the Mycology section of Microbiology department. Results: In our study, the incidence of fungal infection in burn wound patients came out to be 26%. The incidence of fungal infection increased with increase in Total Body Surface Area, (TBSA) increase in depth and age of burn. In our study, the maximum positive fungal cultures were seen in the third week of post-burn period. No positive culture was seen in the first week and 30.76% positive fugal cultures were seen in second postburn week. Candida albicans was found to be the most common organism followed by Non-albicans Candida and Aspergillus. Conclusion: It was concluded from the study that incidence of fungal infections in thermal burns increased with increase in post-burn period and with increasing depth and TBSA of burns. Candida albicans was found to be the most common fungus.",126
"This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of game-based learning in supporting IT education particularly in network security topics. To attain this objective, the post-test was administered to the participant. This study adopted the Quasi-experimental research design involving 91 participants. The finding from this study suggested that participants who participated in game-based learning outperformed the participants in the control group.",46
"A method for predicting the shear strength of materials over multiple length scales is developed and tested. The method is based oil renormalizing the energies and shear displacements obtained through electronic structure calculations of nanoscale models of the material of interest. All material- and size-dependent quantities are incorporated into the renormalization factors, yielding a universal model that can be applied to many materials and length scales. The model is used to predict the shear strength of Cr2O3 along three relevant slip planes and slip directions. The results demonstrate that the shear strengths of the nanoscale Systems used in the calculations range from 19.4 to 29.4 GPa. These data are then renormalized to predict the shear strength of a grain that is 10 mu m thick, yielding shear strengths ranging from 189 to 342 MPa. The large decrease in the shear strength with increasing grain size is consistent with the behavior of many materials. The ability to capture this change using electronic structure calculations that do not require experimental input may be useful in developing cohesive laws of novel materials for use in large-scale mechanical engineering simulations of materials failure.

"Low testosterone levels are associated with metabolic and cardiovascular disease risk factor, and have been shown to predict type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), myocardial infarction (MI) and all-cause mortality. It is not known if these associations are causal or not. Recently, it has been shown that the serum testosterone levels are associated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and we therefore studied the associations between one of these SNPs, rs1799941 on the Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) gene, and MI, T2DM, cancer and death. DNA was prepared from men who participated in the fourth survey of the TromsO Study in 1994-1995 and who were registered with the endpoints MI, T2DM, cancer or death and a randomly selected control group. For mortality, the observation time was set from 1994, and for the other endpoints from birth. The endpoint data were completed up to 2010-2013. Genetic analyses were successfully performed in 5309 men, of whom 1454 were registered with MI, 638 with T2DM, 1534 with cancer and in 2226 who had died. Men with the minor homozygote genotype had significantly higher levels of total testosterone (14.7%) and SHBG (24.7%) compared with men with the major homozygote genotype, whereas free testosterone levels did not differ significantly between the genotypes. The SNP rs1799941 was not significantly associated with MI, T2DM, cancer or mortality. Thus, our result does not support a causal relationship between total testosterone and SHBG and MI, T2DM, cancer or mortality, suggesting that low testosterone more likely is a marker of poor health.",6
"Reproductive history and exogenous hormonal exposures are acknowledged risk factors for breast cancer in the general population. In women at increased breast cancer risk for genetic predisposition or positive family history, data regarding these risk factors are limited or conflicting, and recommendations for these categories are unclear. We evaluated the characteristics of reproductive life in 2522 women at increased genetic or familial breast cancer risk attending our Family Cancer Center. Breast cancers in BRCA mutation carriers were more likely to be hormone receptor negative, diagnosed at 35 years or before and multiple during the lifetime than tumors in women at increased familial risk, while the distribution of invasive cancers and HER2 positive tumors was similar in the different risk groups. At least one fullterm pregnancy (HR 0.27; 95% CI 0.12-0.58; p = 0.001), breastfeeding either less (HR 0.24; 95% CI 0.09-0.66; p = 0.005) or more (HR 0.25; 95% IC 0.08-0.82; p = 0.022) than one year and late age at menopause (HR 0.10; 95% CI 0.01-0.82; p = 0.033) showed to be protective factors in BRCA mutation carriers, while in women at increased familial risk early age at first full-term pregnancy (HR 0.62; 95% IC 0.38-0.99; p = 0.048) and late menarche (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.42-0.85; p = 0.004) showed to be the main protective factors. Finally, for the entire population, combined hormonal contraceptives demonstrated to do not increase breast cancer risk. The results of our study suggest that women at high familial risk and mutation carries develop tumors with different clinical-pathological characteristics and, consequently, are influenced by different protective and risk factors.",9
"Purpose In the literature, there is limited research about the changed meaning of food, the eating and the eating experience during treatment in patients with head and neck cancer. This systematic review includes findings from a qualitative research synthesis to gain a deeper understanding of the influence and experiences of dysphagia, dysgeusia, oral mucositis and xerostomia in head and neck cancer patients (HNC) and suggests recommendations for care practice. Method A systematic review and meta-synthesis techniques were adopted to identify, appraise and synthesize the relevant literature regarding the experience of nutritional symptoms of HNC patients conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. Several electronic databases such as PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library databases were searched. Results A systematic search yielded 121 papers, of which 12 met the inclusion criteria. A thematic account of shared nutritional symptom experiences reported across studies is highlighted and presented. Eight major themes covering three key supportive care domains were identified: impact of symptoms (symptoms during treatment, symptoms working together, affecting daily living activities and physical changes, symptoms and food changes), changing social networks and support (social life restrictions, support of peers), nutritional concerns and strategies (coping strategies, professional support). Conclusions Dysphagia, dysgeusia, oral mucositis and xerostomia negatively affected the patients' quality of life throughout the period of treatment. The patients' nutritional symptom experiences do not occur in isolation. Therefore, acknowledging the patients' eating difficulties and challenges can guarantee appropriate management and support to best manage symptoms in a timely manner.",121
"The Circle Hough Transform (CHT) is one of the popular circle detection algorithm in image processing and machine vision application, favored for its tolerance to noise. Nevertheless, it involves huge computation and excessive memory requirements. Because of its drawbacks, various modifications have been suggested to increase its performances. In this paper, we present a new modification of the CHT method developed for an automatic biometric iris recognition system. The novelty of this method resides on the use of the incremental property in order to reduce the resources requirement and the parallel property for decreasing the computation time. The incremental property is obtained using the approximation of the used trigonometric functions, while the parallel property is achieved by calculating, at the same time, several point coordinates of the circle. The software implementation and the validation have been done in C++ and MATLAB on real images. The errors analysis and the performances of the proposed method against the basic CHT method are presented in this paper. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.",90
"The mechanism of aerostatic torsional divergence (ATD) of long-span suspension bridges is investigated. A theoretical analysis on the basis of a generalized model is presented, showing that the vertical motion of a bridge deck is crucial to the torsional stiffness of the whole suspended system, and that the vertical motion of either cable with a magnitude beyond a certain threshold could result in a sudden degradation of the torsional stiffness of the system. This vertical motion-induced degradation of stiffness is recognized as the main reason for the ATD. Long-span suspension bridges are susceptible to such a type of divergence, especially when they are immersed in turbulent wind fields. The divergences that occur in turbulent wind fields differ significantly from those in smooth wind fields, and the difference is well explained by the generalized model that the loosening of any one cable could result in the vanishing of the part of stiffness provided by the whole cable system. The mechanism revealed in this paper leads to a definition of the critical wind speed of the ATD in a turbulent flow; that is, the one resulting in a vertical motion so large as to loosen either cable to a stressless state. Numerical results from the nonlinear finite-element (FE) analysis of the Xihoumen suspension bridge, in conjunction with observations from wind tunnel tests on an aero-elastic full bridge model, are in support of the viewpoint presented in this study.

"In this paper, we investigate the power efficient resource allocation algorithm design for secure multiuser wireless communication systems employing a full-duplex (FD) base station (BS) for serving multiple half-duplex (HD) downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) users simultaneously. We propose a multi-objective optimization framework to study two conflicting yet desirable design objectives, i.e., total DL transmit power minimization and total UL transmit power minimization. To this end, the weighed Tchebycheff method is adopted to formulate the resource allocation algorithm design as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP). The considered MOOP takes into account the quality-of-service requirements of all legitimate users for guaranteeing secure DL and UL transmission in the presence of potential eavesdroppers. Thereby, secure UL transmission is enabled by the FD BS and would not be possible with an HD BS. The imperfectness of the channel state information of the eavesdropping channels and the inter-user interference channels is incorporated for robust resource allocation algorithm design. Although the considered MOOP is non-convex, we solve it optimally by semidefinite programming relaxation. Simulation results not only unveil the trade-off between the total DL transmit power and the total UL transmit power, but also confirm the robustness of the proposed algorithm against potential eavesdroppers.",35
"Measuring the impact of image based web technologies in educational communication is part of a larger theses, aimed to determine the overall impact of image based web 2.0 technologies in visual communication. In this particular chapter, we try to monitor the impact of these technologies in social progress through visual communication of academic education of two societies Romania and the USA. To that end, we chose two renowned polytechnic universities of both countries, representative for engineering, robotics and computer programming the most exposed areas to progress in society Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the Politehnica University of Timisoara (UPT). In the case study we report the presence of the university in Romania on the web 2.0 platforms to the US university presence on these platforms, determining the degree of impact of these technologies through visual communication in education.",40
"A test campaign was launched to determine the mechanical properties of the High Luminosity-Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) 11 T Nb3Sn magnet components. The results can be used to accurately represent the mechanical properties in finite element models that predict the stress and strain distribution in these magnets. Particular attention is paid to anisotropic mechanical behavior of the different magnet materials. Static and dynamic test methods have been applied for determining elastic materials' behavior, and highly accurate Young's moduli are obtained with the nondestructive dynamic methods resonance and impulse excitation at ambient temperature and during in situ heat cycles.",80
"This paper introduces preliminary developments of an NSF-funded on-going educational project. The project goal is to enhance student technical and professional skills and business knowledge by integrating lean manufacturing education into a traditional manufacturing engineering program. A group of faculty members with complementary background and expertise in engineering and business co-taught a new Lean course that attracted student enrollments from five departments across campus. In addition to plant tours, guest lectures' and real-world industrial projects, we particularly designed an innovative and unique experience, Lean Lego Simulation (LLS), which has proven valuable for students to better understand lean principles and applications. Course survey shows student feedback was overwhelmingly positive. Evaluation is also being carried out to measure how well the project is working from the viewpoint of all participants especially faculty collaboration and student achievements.",84
"Liquid marbles are drops coated with a hydrophobic powder. Different liquid marbles can be easily distinguished by the diverse color appearance. Here, we first demonstrate colorful liquid marbles, which were encapsulated with colored superhydrophobic stearate powders. A simple method was used to generate colorful superhydrophobic stearate powders via chemical reactions between sodium stearate and inorganic salts. In addition, the contact angle meter was used to monitor the horizontal profiles of liquid marbles to investigate the lifetime of liquid marbles on the stainless steel surface at room conditions. More important, we have described a proof of qualitative detection of oil pollution and measured the minimum detection limit of some water-soluble pollutants by liquid marbles.",96
"Variations in DNA copy number carry important information on genome evolution and regulation of DNA replication in cancer cells. The rapid development of single-cell sequencing technology allows one to explore gene expression heterogeneity among single-cells, thus providing important cancer cell evolution information. Single-cell DNA/RNA sequencing data usually have low genome coverage, which requires an extra step of amplification to accumulate enough samples. However, such amplification will introduce large bias and makes bioinformatics analysis challenging. Accurately modeling the distribution of sequencing data and effectively suppressing the bias influence is the key to success variations analysis. Recent advances demonstrate the technical noises by amplification are more likely to follow negative binomial distribution, a special case of Poisson distribution. Thus, we tackle the problem CNV detection by formulating it into a quadratic optimization problem involving two constraints, in which the underling signals are corrupted by Poisson distributed noises. By imposing the constraints of sparsity and smoothness, the reconstructed read depth signals from single-cell sequencing data are anticipated to fit the CNVs patterns more accurately. An efficient numerical solution based on the classical alternating direction minimization method (ADMM) is tailored to solve the proposed model. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method Using both synthetic and empirical single-cell sequencing data. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves excellent performance and high promise of success with single-cell sequencing data.

"The effects of brown-rot decay on the mechanical and chemical properties of poplar (Populus cathayana Rehd(I)) wood were investigated, while the correlation of several properties to the decay degree and to each other were quantified. During the decay process, the losses in impact bending strength (IBS) and modulus of rupture (MOR) increased logarithmically with the degree of decay, whereas the losses in modulus of elasticity (MOE) and compressive strength parallel to grain (CSI) increased slowly with linear trends. The ranking of the four mechanical parameters for the response speed to decay and the degree of the influence of decay were IBS >MOR >MOE >CSI. Hemicelluloses were preferably decomposed by the brown-rot fungus. The prominent degradation of cellulose began from a weight loss (W-L) of 18.7%, where the relative crystallinity decreased. In summary, the degradation of hemicelluloses caused a fast and significant decrease in IBS while the subsequent removal of paracrystalline cellulose resulted in MOR loss. The variation of MOE was in correlation with the cellulose content. A decrease in CSI was due to the slow deterioration of crystalline cellulose.",121
"The thrifty genotype and phenotype hypotheses were developed to explain the rapid increase in diabetes and obesity in developed countries around the world. Most subsequent ""thrifty"" research has focused on the early developmental origins of the metabolic syndrome and cardio-metabolic disease. The goal of this manuscript is to review an emerging line of research that uses a similar thrifty framework to understand the early developmental origins of eating-related phenotypes that have primary relevance to many psychiatric disorders. Given the important role of environmental adversity in various psychiatric disorders that involve overeating, and their early age of onset, it is likely that several thrifty mechanisms are relevant in this regard. Understanding the early origins of increased eating behaviour based on a thrifty model might point the way to highly targeted preventative interventions during critical periods of development, and provide a new way of addressing these common and difficult to treat disorders.",71
"Waxy starches consist almost exclusively of amylopectin and don't contain amylose molecules. Despite extensive knowledge - and certain applications - of waxy maize starch in former times, the production and use of other high amylopectin starches is now increasing. This review deals with the physical processing of these starches (via gelatinization, gelation, extrusion, annealing, and heat moisture treatment) and with chemical and biochemical modification (e.g. acetylation, debranching of amylopectin, hydrolysis). Great attention is paid to the digestibility of the products and the formation of nanoparticles. Both usual and new food and non-food uses of rice, maize, wheat, barley and potato waxy starches are referred to. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",80
"The present paper reports on longitudinal associations between parenting stress and sexual satisfaction among 169 heterosexual couples in the first year after the birth of a first child. Actor Partner Interdependence Modeling (APIM) was used to model the effects of the mother's and father's parenting stress at 6 months after birth on sexual satisfaction at 1 year after birth. Based on social constructivist theory and scarcity theory, two hypotheses were posed: (a) mothers' parenting stress will predict their own later sexual satisfaction whereas fathers' parenting stress will not predict their own later sexual satisfaction (actor effects) and (b) mothers' parenting stress will predict fathers' later sexual satisfaction but fathers' parenting stress will not predict mothers' later sexual satisfaction (partner effects). On average, parents were only somewhat satisfied with their sex life. The first hypothesis was supported as greater parenting stress significantly predicted lower sexual satisfaction for mothers but not for fathers. The second hypothesis was also supported as mothers' greater parenting stress significantly predicted less sexual satisfaction in fathers, whereas fathers' parenting stress did not significantly predict mothers' sexual satisfaction. We discuss how our results may be interpreted considering the social construction of gendered family roles.",18
"The impact of mechanical forces on pathogenesis of airway remodeling and the functional consequences in asthma remains to be fully established. In the present study, we investigated the effect of repeated bronchoconstriction induced by methacholine (MCh) on airway remodeling and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in rats with or without sensitization to an external allergen. We provide evidence that repeated bronchoconstriction, using MCh, alone induces airway inflammation and remodeling as well as AHR in non-allergen-sensitized rats. Also, we found that the airways are structurally and functionally altered by bronchoconstriction induced by either allergen or MCh in allergen-sensitized animals. This finding provides a new animal model for the development of airway remodeling and AHR in mammals and can be used for studying the complex reciprocal relationship between bronchoconstriction and airway inflammation. Further studies on presented animal models are required to clarify the exact mechanisms underlying airway remodeling due to bronchoconstriction and the functional consequences.",109
"The 3D printing process is highlighted nowadays as a possibility to generate individual parts with complex geometries. Moreover, the development of 3D printing hardware, software and parameters permits the manufacture of parts that can be not only used as prototypes, but are also made from materials that are suitable for implantation. In this way, this study investigates the process involved in the production of patient-specific craniofacial implants using calcium phosphate cement, and its dimensional accuracy. The implants were previously generated in a computer-aided design environment based on the patient's tomographic data. The fabrication of the implants was carried out in a commercial 3D powder printing system using alfa-tricalcium phosphate powder and an aqueous solution of Na2HPO4 as a binder. The fit of the 3D printed implants was measured by three-dimensional laser scanning and by checking the right adjustment to the patient's anatomical biomodel. The printed parts presented a good degree of fitting and accuracy.",82
"Purpose: To assess the risk factors and outcomes associated with fungemia caused by the six most commonly occurring Candida species in patients with and without malignancies. Methods: Analysis of the episodes of fungemia due to common Candida species in adults, based on an active hospital-based surveillance program (Paris area, France, 2002 to 2014). Results: Of the 3417 patients (3666 isolates), 1164 (34.1%) had a solid tumor (45.7% digestive tract) and 586 (17.1%) a hematological malignancy (41.8% lymphoma, 33.5% acute leukemia). The hematology patients were significantly younger, more often pre-exposed to antifungals, more often infected by C. tropicalis, C. krusei, or C. kefyr, and more often treated in the first instance with an echinocandin. Compared with inpatients who were not in ICU at the time of fungemia, those in ICU were less frequently infected by C. parapsilosis (p < 0.02), had more recent surgery (p < 0.03), and died more frequently before day 8 and day 30 (p < 0.0001). An increase in crude mortality over time in ICU was observed only in oncology patients (p < 0.04). For all patients, lack of prescription of antifungals despite knowledge of positive blood culture increased the risk of death. The odds of being infected by a given Candida species compared with C. albicans were uneven regarding age, gender, type of malignancy, hospitalization in ICU, central venous catheter, HIV status, intravenous drug addiction, and previous exposure to antifungal drugs. Compared with C. albicans, C. glabrata (OR = 0.69 [0.54-0.89]) and C. parapsilosis (OR = 0.49 [0.35-0.67]) were associated with a decreased risk of death by day 8 and day 30. Conclusion: The clinical context of underlying malignancy and hospitalization in ICU may be relevant to the initial management of candidemia.",104
"In this study, we sought to clarify if and how the functions of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) relate to duration of NSSI or change over time. To accomplish this aim, we analyzed data obtained from routine clinical evaluations completed within a specialized acute-care treatment program for NSSI. Specifically, we examined how functions of NSSI vary between patients by duration of NSSI, how functions changed within patients over time, and how changes in NSSI functions related to treatment outcomes. Neither internal nor social functions were associated with NSSI duration between patients after controlling for relevant covariates. For patients completing two admissions assessments, internal and social functions decreased similarly over time, although the decrease in internal functions was no longer significant after controlling for decreases in NSSI urges. For patients who completed admissions and discharge assessments, internal and social functions decreased over the course of treatment, with larger decreases in internal functions. Decreases in both types of functions related to improved treatment outcomes. In conclusion, our results suggest that NSSI functions are generally stable across time, although decreases in NSSI functions may relate to clinical improvement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

"Average happiness in big cities with more than 250,000 inhabitants is, in the USA, lower than average happiness in towns and in the country. Adam Kozaryn offers several explanations. One explanation is that core characteristics of cities, such as size, density and heterogeneity lead to a deterioration of social relations. This explanation is insufficient because average happiness in cities can also be relatively high, as is the case in poor nations, compared to happiness in towns and in the country. Important factors like relative safety and the availability of services have to be considered additionally. A second explanation is that capitalism plays a more dominant role in cities, with similar negative effects. This explanation is also insufficient because the negative effects of capitalism are not limited to cities. A more plausible explanation is that average happiness in American cities is relatively low, because of the interaction of their core characteristics and capitalism. More people should live in smaller places, but this is impossible. There are too many people and big cities are needed to minimize their ecological footprint. Overpopulation is the root of the problem. A discussion about the maximum size of the population is needed. There is no reason to fear for a negative impact on individual freedom, but people can pay attention to this discussion if they make up their mind about having children.",116
"Plant beta-1, 3-glucanases are involved in plant defense and in development. Very little data are available on the expression of rice glucanases both in developmental tissues and under various stresses. In this study, we cloned and characterized twenty-seven rice beta-1, 3-glucanases (OsGlu) from at total of 71 putative glucanases. The OsGlu genes were obtained by PCR from a cDNA library and were classified into seven groups (Group I to VII) according to their DNA or amino acid sequence homology. Analysis of the expression of the twenty-seven OsGlu genes by Northern blotting revealed that they were differentially expressed in different developmental tissues as Well as in response to plant hormones, biotic stress, high salt etc. OsGlu11 and 27 in Group IV were clearly expressed only in stem and leaf and were also induced strongly by SA (5 mM), ABA (200 mu M), and M. grisea. OsGlu1, 10, 11, and 14 were induced earlier and to higher levels in incompatible M. grisea interaction than in compatible one. Taken together, our findings suggest that the twenty-seven rice OsGlu gene products play diverse roles not only in plant defense but also in hormonal responses and in development.",38
"Xylitol, a five carbon sugar alcohol, occurs widely in nature but it is also a normal intermediate in human metabolism. As an alternative sweetener, it is recommended for diabetics and for the prevention of dental caries. Xylitol is currently produced chemically on a large scale. Microbial production is lately becoming more attractive since the downstream processing is expected to be cheaper. Among microorganisms, yeasts are the best xylitol producers, particularly those belonging to the genus Candida. The key enzymes for xylitol production in yeasts are D-xylose reductase which, using either NADH or NADPH, reduces D-xylose to xylitol, and predominantly, NAD-linked xylitol dehydrogenase which reoxidizes xylitol to D-xylulose. Xylitol accumulation in yeasts is sensitive to environmental conditions such as nutrition, temperature, pH, inoculum, substrate and aeration, with the last two being critical for yeast growth and fermentation. Hemicellulosic hydrolysates derived from hardwood and particularly from agricultural residues, such as sugar cane bagasse, corn cabs, wheat and rice straw, are used as feedstock for xylitol production. Due to the presence of inhibitory components, some of the hydrolysates have to be treated prior to microbial utilization. The most investigated types of processes have been batch ones, although fed-batch and immobilized systems have been characterized by the highest yields and productivities. Apart from the naturally occurring yeasts, recombinant strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in free and immobilized form were also investigated for xylitol production.",32
"Animal and human studies suggest that initial expression of maternal behaviour depends on oxytocin and dopamine systems. However, the mechanism by which these systems affect parenting behaviours and the timing of these effects are not well understood. This article explores the role of mothers' executive function in mediating the relation between oxytocin and dopamine gene variants and maternal responsiveness at 48 months post-partum. Participants (n= 157) were mothers recruited in the Maternal Adversity, Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment Study, which assesses longitudinally two cohorts of mothers and children in Canada. We examined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to the dopamine and oxytocin systems (DRD1 rs686, DRD1 rs265976, OXTR rs237885 and OXTR rs2254298), assessed mothers' decision-making at 48 months using the Cambridge Neurological Automated Testing Battery (CANTAB) and evaluated maternal responsiveness from videotaped interactions during the Etch-A-Sketch co-operation task. Mediation analyses showed that OXTR rs2254298 A-carriers had an indirect effect on positive parenting which was mediated by mothers' performance on decision-making task (estimate= 0.115, P < 0.005), while OXTR rs2254298 A-carriers had both direct and indirect effects on physically controlling parenting, also mediated through enhanced performance on decision-making (estimate=-0.059, P0.05). While oxytocin has previously been associated with only the early onset of maternal behaviour, we show that an OXTR polymorphism is involved in maternal behaviour at 48 months post-partum through mothers' executive function. This research highlights the importance of the oxytocin system to maternal parenting beyond infancy.",62
"BACKGROUNDPatients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) including polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and myelofibrosis, are faced with oppressive symptom profiles that compromise daily functioning and quality of life. Among these symptoms, sexuality-related symptoms have emerged as particularly prominent and largely unaddressed. In the current study, the authors evaluated how sexuality symptoms from MPN relate to other patient characteristics, disease features, treatments, and symptoms. METHODSA total of 1971 patients with MPN (827 with essential thrombocythemia, 682 with polycythemia vera, 456 with myelofibrosis, and 6 classified as other) were prospectively evaluated and patient responses to the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPN-SAF) and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC-QLQ C30) were collected, along with information regarding individual disease characteristics and laboratory data. Sexuality scores were compared with an age-matched, healthy control population. RESULTSOverall, patients with MPN were found to have greater sexual dysfunction compared with the healthy population (MPN-SAF score of 3.6 vs 2.0; P65 years and in those with cytopenias and transfusion requirements, and those receiving certain therapies such as immunomodulators or steroids. ConclusionsThe results of the current study identify the topic of sexuality as a prominent issue for the MPN population, and this area would appear to benefit from additional investigation and management. Cancer 2016;122:1888-96. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

"AIM To determine the functional role of miR-490-5p in mast cell proliferation and apoptosis, and in the mast cell tryptase/PAR-2 signal pathway. METHODS The 3rd generation of lentivirus vector systems containing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (Ruisai Inc., Shanghai, China), which acts as a reporter gene was used to construct the mmu-miR-490-5p lentivirus expression vector pEGFP-antagomiR-4905p, and the lentivirus vector pEGFP-negative was used as a negative control. The stably transfected mast cell line p815 was then constructed. GFP positive cells were successfully transfected cells. We determined the expression of miR-490-5p in p815 mast cells before and after transfection using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). In addition, after transduction with the lentivirus vectors, the role of miR-490-5p in mast cell proliferation and apoptosis was investigated using the CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The mRNA levels of tryptase and PAR-2 were detected by qRT-PCR and the protein levels were detected by Western blot. RESULTS The inhibition of miR-490-5p expression promoted apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of p815 mast cells. The mRNA levels of tryptase and PAR-2 were significantly increased after transfection compared with the control group, tryptase (P = 0.721, normal vs null; P = 0.001, siRNA vs normal; P = 0.002, siRNA vs null) and PAR-2 (P = 0.027, siRNA vs null; P = 0.353, normal vs null; P = 0.105, siRNA vs normal). The protein levels of tryptase and PAR2 were slightly higher in the siRNA group than those in the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant (P >0.05). CONCLUSION miR-490-5p plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome by affecting mast cell proliferation and apoptosis; with down-regulation of miR-490-5p, the mRNA level of mast cell tryptase and PAR-2 increased, and the protein level increased, but the difference was not statistically significant.",4
"Background.-Postural headaches are commonly associated with spontaneous intracranial hypotension and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage from the spine. A subarachnoid-pleural fistula (SPF) is a very rare and serious type of CSF fistula that has mostly been reported following traumatic causes. Case Report.-Here, the case of a 36-year-old woman who suffered from postural headaches after chiropractic manipulation of her neck was reported. Brain and spinal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed brain sagging, a C7-T1 dural defect, and overt CSF leakage. Heavy T2-weighted MR myelography revealed paravertebral fluid collections, communicating with pleural effusions through bilateral SPFs. The postural headaches were relieved by 3 courses of epidural blood patches. Discussions.-From the patient's history, her severe SPFs were attributed to rupture of the spinal leptomeninges during vigorous chiropractic manipulation of her neck. Heavy T2-weighted MR myelography could delineate the route of SPFs and CSF leakages.",127
"DNA palindromes are known to have many beneficial and detrimental functions in cell biology. Most of these functions are shared between perfect and imperfect palindromic sequences, but imperfect palindromes can be of particular interest due to their additional ability to dramatically increase the local mutation rate. Almost all available tools capable of extracting genetic palindromes were designed to accommodate inverted repeats, which are palindromic sequences with centralized non-matching nucleotides. We developed computational methods that focus specifically on perfect and imperfect palindromes, allowing us to take advantage of palindrome-specific properties which led to an 8x to 40x increase in speed and an approximately 10x decrease in memory requirements compared to the leading inverted repeats detection method.",2
"The aim of this study was to examine the informational cues that male and female students perceive to be influential when developing initial impressions and expectancies of a lecturer. University students (n=752) rated the extent to which 30 informational cues influence their initial perceptions of a lecturer. Following exploratory factor analysis (EFA), a five-factor model (i.e. appearance (APP), accessories (ACC), third-party reports (TPR), communication skills (CS) and nationality/ethnicity (NE)) was extracted for male students and a five-factor model (i.e. ACC, TPR, APP, interpersonal skills (IPS) and engagement (ENG)) extracted for female students. Inspection of mean scores identified that male students rated CS (e.g. clarity of voice) and TPR (e.g. qualifications) and female students IPS (e.g. control of class), ENG (e.g. eye contact) and TPR to be influential factors in forming initial impressions and expectancies of a lecturer. The findings further identify the potential for expectancy effects within student-lecturer interactions.",63
"A novel motor design methodology and optimization is proposed, which is applied to a SRM. It greatly reduces the finite element analysis use. A multi physics study is realized in order to couple the thermal, magnetic and electric motor analysis. Then, the information obtained with this study allows creating different behaviors maps in order to evaluate the motor in all operating area. With the joule and iron losses, the thermal network obtains a temperature map for each current and angular speed. Then, the electric model uses the parameters obtained on reluctances network and the phase resistance variation obtained on thermal lumped parameter. Finally, the optimal motor obtained is validated on FEA. To sum up, the motor design is obtained using multi physics analysis taking into account different operating points, i.e. it is a range operation optimization. In addition, reducing FEA computation time is achieved with the methodology proposed.",53
"Intra-uterine device (IUD) is one of the birth control methods, which is available for nulliparous women, even though misconceptions still remain in medical or popular opinion. Only 1.3 % of nulliparous have a IUD as contraception in France while it is the second methods used by all women, after pill. The best contraception is the one chosen by women; however, the choice for a nulliparous of an IUD may be really difficult, despite the increasing number of women wishing to use it. Long-acting reversible contraceptives utilization, including IUD, is probably one of the issues to decrease the unintended pregnancies. An exhaustive and clear information about IUD is necessary to allow an informed and real choice. This prescription must consider contraindications and medical conditions for safe insertion, especially to avoid infection by screening STD (Chlamydia trachomatis and Nesseria gonorrhoeae) in nulliparous women < 25 years old. Insertion must be effected with usual precautions and short or SL IUD preferred. Even if side effects such as expulsion, pelvic pains or dysmenorrhea are more frequent by nulliparous, IUD is a first intention choice for contraception to be consider, that women could obtain easily, including in emergency contraception situation.

"The slender and flexible characteristics make Runyang Suspension Bridge (RSB) sensitive to the wind actions. In order to obtain reliable statistical wind characteristics and monitor the wind environment at the bridge site, two anemometers are included in the structural health monitoring system (SHMS) to collect extensive wind data. In this paper, the recorded real-time wind data are analyzed in detail to acquire the wind rose diagram, mean wind speed and direction, turbulence intensity, turbulence integral scale, and power spectral density (PSD). Three strong wind events including Typhoon Matsa, Typhoon Khanun and Northern wind are comparatively analyzed to show the inhomogeneous wind characteristics. And the measured wind characteristics are compared with the recommended values in current specification of China. The analytical results show that the wind speed and wind direction at RSB site are greatly influenced by the subtropical monsoon climate and typhoon climate. And the traditional known rules concerning turbulence intensity are not proper for strong winds, while the rules can be validated by long-term monitored data. Meanwhile, the recommended values of turbulence integral scale by current specification are suitable for long-term monitored wind, but the adaptability to strong wind is still defective. In addition, the measured along-wind spectra match generally well with the commonly used PSDs of turbulence. However, more researches are still needed to refine current PSDs of turbulence to perfectly satisfy with the measured spectrum. The conclusions can provide references for the wind-resistant analysis of RSB and structures in similar areas.",97
"Disseminated peritoneal leiomyomatosis (DPL) is a rare disorder characterized by the presence of multifocal nodules and tumors composed of proliferating smooth muscle tissue, spread throughout the peritoneum. Estrogens and progesterone are considered to be the main factors initiating the formation of disseminated leiomyomatosis. Disseminated peritoneal leiomyomatosis is often asymptomatic, and acyclic vaginal bleeding or pain in the lower abdomen is associated with leiomyomatous rebuilt uterus corpus. Disseminated peritoneal leiomyomatosis can have other ambiguous presentation. The difficulty in DPL diagnosis is that it is not always accompanied by scattered leiomyomas and can occur after menopause. Some cases of DPL are associated with surgical procedures on uterine fibroids, especially with the use of a morcellator. We present the case of a 39-year-old woman with DPL who underwent laparoscopic myomectomy and laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy before the final diagnosis of DPL After the complete surgical treatment performed in our center the patient is free of symptoms.",9
"Quantitative assessment of gait in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is an important step in addressing motor symptoms and improving clinical management. Based on the assessment of only 5 meters of gait with a single body-fixed-sensor placed on the lower back, this study presents a method for the identification of step-by-step kinematic parameters in 14 healthy controls and in 28 patients at early-to-moderate stages of idiopathic PD. Differences between groups in step-by-step kinematic parameters were evaluated to understand gait impairments in the PD group. Moreover, a discriminant model between groups was built from a subset of significant and independent parameters and based on a 10-fold cross-validated model. The discriminant model correctly classified a total of 89.5% participants with four kinematic parameters. The sensitivity of the model was 95.8% and the specificity 78.6%. The results indicate that the proposed method permitted to reasonably recognize idiopathic PD-associated gait from 5-m walking assessments. This motivates further investigation on the clinical utility of short episodes of gait assessment with body-fixed- sensors.",19
"Myofibroblasts, the primary effector cells that mediate matrix remodeling during pulmonary fibrosis, rapidly assemble an extracellular fibronectin matrix. Tensin (TNS) 1 is a key component of specialized cellular adhesions (fibrillar adhesions) that bind to extracellular fibronectin fibrils. We hypothesized that TNS1 may play a role in modulating myofibroblast-mediated matrix formation. We found that TNS1 expression is increased in fibroblastic foci from lungs with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta profoundly up-regulates TNS1 expression with kinetics that parallel the expression of the myofibroblast marker, smooth muscle a-actin. TGF-beta-induced TNS1 expression is dependent on signaling through the TGF-beta receptor 1 and is Rho coiled-coiled kinase/actin/megakaryoblastic leukemia-1/serum response factor dependent. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of TNS1 disrupted TGF-beta-induced myofibroblast differentiation, without affecting TGF-beta/Smad signaling. In contrast, loss of TNS1 resulted in disruption of focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation, focal adhesion formation, and actin stress fiber development. Finally, TNS1 was essential for the formation of fibrillar adhesions and the assembly of nascent fibronectin and collagen matrix in myofibroblasts. In summary, our data show that TNS1 is a novel megakaryoblastic leukemia1- dependent gene that is induced during pulmonary fibrosis. TNS1 plays an essential role in TGF-beta-induced myofibroblast differentiation and myofibroblast-mediated formation of extracellular fibronectin and collagen matrix. Targeted disruption of TNS1 and associated signaling may provide an avenue to inhibit tissue fibrosis.",3
"Efficient liquid cooling systems in cutting and chipping processes are essential to remain below the temperature limits of the cutting tool and materials. Impinging jet cooling near the processing location is a widely employed technique for this purpose. The cooling effect can be optimized using a pulsating cooling fluid to improve heat transfer, via a periodic renewal of the hydrodynamic and thermal boundary layer. This study focuses on a cooling nozzle which generates a passive jet excitation, without an electric motor or any valve system. Four different nozzle design mechanisms for the jet excitation were developed and tested with respect to their passively generated pulsation. Strouhal number, pressure fluctuation and pulsation amplitude were measured. A Strouhal number close to 0.2 was achieved with one excitation mechanism. The Strouhal number achieved by the other mechanisms was above 0.1. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",53
"Stressors during early life induce anxiety- and depressive-like responses in adult rodents. Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) exposed to short days post-weaning also increase adult anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors. To test the hypothesis that melatonin and exposure to stressors early in life interact to alter adult affective responses, we administered melatonin either during the perinatal (gestational day 7 to postnatal day 14) or postnatal (day 15-56) periods and also exposed a subset of dams to restraint during gestation (1 h-2x/day for 4 days). During the final week of injections, depressive-like behaviors were assessed using the sucrose anhedonia and forced swim tests. Hamsters exposed to prenatal restraint and treated with melatonin only during the postnatal period increased depressive-like responses in the forced swim test relative to all other groups. Offspring from restrained dams increased the number of fecal boli produced during the forced swim test, an anxiety-like response. In the present study, prenatal restraint reduced CA1 dendritic branching overall and perinatal melatonin protected hamsters from this restraint-induced reduction. These results suggest that the photoperiodic conditions coincident with birth and early life stressors are important in the development of adult affective responses. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

"Typical Internet of Things (IoT) applications involve collecting information automatically from diverse geographically-distributed smart sensors and concentrating the information into more powerful computers. The Raspberry Pi platform has become a very interesting choice for IoT applications for several reasons: (1) good computing power/cost ratio; (2) high availability; it has become a de facto hardware standard; and (3) ease of use; it is based on operating systems with a big community of users. In IoT applications, data are frequently carried by means of wireless sensor networks in which energy consumption is a key issue. Energy consumption is especially relevant for smart sensors that are scattered over wide geographical areas and may need to work unattended on batteries for long intervals of time. In this scenario, it is convenient to ease the construction of IoT applications while keeping energy consumption to a minimum at the sensors. This work proposes a possible gateway implementation with specific technologies. It solves the following research question: how to build gateways for IoT applications with Raspberry Pi and low power IQRF communication modules. The following contributions are presented: (1) one architecture for IoT gateways that integrates data from sensor nodes into a higher level application based on low-cost/low-energy technologies; (2) bindings in Java and C that ease the construction of IoT applications; (3) an empirical model that describes the consumption of the communications at the nodes (smart sensors) and allows scaling their batteries; and (4) validation of the proposed energy model at the battery-operated nodes.",68
"ObjectiveThis study examined the role of expertise in clinicians' memory for case details. Clinicians' diagnostic formulations may afford mechanisms for retaining and retrieving information. MethodExperts (N = 41; 47.6% males, 23.8% females; 28.6% did not report gender; age: mean [M] = 54.69) were members of the American Board of Professional Psychologists. Lay judges (N = 156; 25.4% males, 74.1% females; age: M = 18.85) were undergraduates enrolled in general psychology. Three vignettes were presented to each group, creating a 2 (group: expert, lay judge) x 3 (vignettes: simple, complex-coherent, complex-incoherent) mixed factorial design. Recall accuracy for vignette details was the dependent variable. ResultsData analyses used multivariate analyses of variance to detect group differences among multiple continuous variables. Experts recalled more information than lay judges, overall. However, experts also exhibited more false memories for the complex-incoherent case because of their schema-based knowledge. ConclusionsThis study supported clinical expertise as beneficial. Nonetheless, negative influences from experts' schema-based knowledge, as exhibited, could adversely affect clinical practices.",78
"Tobacco smoking and smoke exposure during pregnancy are associated with a range of adverse health outcomes, including preterm birth. Also, children born preterm have a higher risk of complications including bronchopulmonary dysplasia and asthma when their mothers smoked during pregnancy. Smoking cessation in early pregnancy can help reduce the adverse impact on offspring health. Counselling interventions are effective in promoting smoking cessation and reducing the incidence of preterm birth. Peer support and incentive-based approaches are likely to be of additional benefit, whereas the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions, including nicotine replacement therapy, has not definitely been established. Smoke-free legislation can help reduce smoke exposure as well as maternal smoking rates at a population level, and is associated with a reduction in preterm birth. Helping future mothers to stop smoking and protect their children from second hand smoke exposure must be a key priority for health care workers and policy makers alike. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"Overexpression of Rabl3 is associated with some malignancies. However, their relationship with hepatocellular carcinoma remains unclear. In this study, the expression of Rabl3 in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, and four pairs of matched hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and their adjacent normal hepatic tissues were detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot. In addition, the protein expression of Rabl3 was examined in 162 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma by immunohistochemistry. Rabl3 in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines was elevated at both messenger RNA and protein levels, and the Rabl3 protein was significantly upregulated by upto 3.3-fold in hepatocellular carcinoma compared with the paired normal hepatic tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that overexpressions of Rabl3 were 80.2% in hepatocellular carcinoma. Rabl3 is expressed at significantly higher rates in hepatocellular carcinoma compared with adjacent normal hepatic tissue (p < 0.01). Statistical analysis suggested the upregulation of Rabl3 was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis, tumor thrombus of the portal vein, and advanced clinical stage (p < 0.05). Furthermore, we found that overexpression of Rabl3 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells could significantly enhance cell proliferation and growth ability. Conversely, silencing Rabl3 by small hairpin RNA interference caused an inhibition of cell proliferation and growth. Our studies suggest that the Rabl3 is a valuable marker of hepatocellular carcinoma progression and that the overexpression of Rabl3 plays an important role in the development and pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma.",37
"Brushless DC motor (BLDC) are widely used for many industrial applications because of their high efficiency, high torque and low volume. This paper focuses on speed control of BLDC motor using soft computing technique. The problems related to control systems are undesirable overshoot, longer settling times and vibrations while going from one state to another. To overcome the maximum overshoot and longer settling times, PID and self-tuning Fuzzy PID control techniques were used in the closed loop controller architecture. The speed control of BLDC motor was simulated using MATLAB/ SIMULINK and the results are obtained. The simulation results revealed that the proposed self-tuning fuzzy PID controller provides better performance than conventional controller. The prototype model of BLDC motor is presented and the speed response of BLDC motor is observed by LCD display.",59

"Background: Freedom from discrimination is one of the key principles in a human rights-based approach to maternal and newborn health. Objective: To review the published evidence on discrimination against Romani women in maternity care in Europe, and on interventions to address this. Search strategy: A systematic search of eight electronic databases was undertaken in 2015 using the terms ""Roma"" and ""maternity care"". A broad search for grey literature included the websites of relevant agencies. Data extraction and synthesis: Standardised data extraction tables were utilised, quality was formally assessed and a line of argument synthesis was developed and tested against the data from the grey literature. Results: Nine hundred papers were identified; three qualitative studies and seven sources of grey literature met the review criteria. These revealed that many Romani women encounter barriers to accessing maternity care. Even when they are able to access care, they can experience discriminatory mistreatment on the basis of their ethnicity, economic status, place of residence or language. The grey literature revealed some health professionals held underlying negative beliefs about Romani women. There were no published research studies examining the effectiveness of interventions to address discrimination against Romani women and their infants in Europe. The Roma Health Mediation Programme is a promising intervention identified in the grey literature. Conclusions: There is evidence of discrimination against Romani women in maternity care in Europe. Interventions to address discrimination against childbearing Romani women and underlying health provider prejudice are urgently needed, alongside analysis of factors predicting the success or failure of such initiatives.",61
"The epidemiology of respiratory viruses (RVs) in lung transplant recipients (LTRs) and the relationship of RVs to lung function, acute rejection (AR) and opportunistic infections in these patients are not well known. We performed a prospective cohort study (2009-2014) by collecting nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) from asymptomatic LTRs during seasonal changes and from LTRs with upper respiratory tract infectious disease (URTID), lower respiratory tract infectious disease (LRTID) and AR. NPSs were analyzed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Overall, 1094 NPSs were collected from 98 patients with a 23.6% positivity rate and mean follow-up of 3.4 years (interquartile range 2.5-4.0 years). Approximately half of URTIDs (47 of 97, 48.5%) and tracheobronchitis cases (22 of 56, 39.3%) were caused by picornavirus, whereas pneumonia was caused mainly by paramyxovirus (four of nine, 44.4%) and influenza (two of nine, 22.2%). In LTRs with LRTID, lung function changed significantly at 1 mo (p = 0.03) and 3 mo (p = 0.04). In a nested case-control analysis, AR was associated with RVs (hazard ratio [HR] 6.54), Pseudomonas aeruginosa was associated with LRTID (HR 8.54), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) replication or disease was associated with URTID (HR 2.53) in the previous 3 mo. There was no association between RVs and Aspergillus spp. colonization or infection (HR 0.71). In conclusion, we documented a high incidence of RV infections in LTRs. LRTID produced significant lung function abnormalities. Associations were observed between AR and RVs, between P. aeruginosa colonization or infection and LRTID, and between CMV replication or disease and URTID. A large prospective study of the epidemiology of respiratory viruses in lung transplant recipients using molecular assays demonstrates a very high incidence of respiratory viral infection and an association between respiratory virus infectious diseases, immediate allograft dysfunction, and the development of acute rejection and opportunistic infection.",37
"The etiological mechanism underpinning any sports-related injury is complex and multifactorial. Frequently, athletes perceive ""excessive training"" as the principal factor in their injury, an observation that is biologically plausible yet somewhat ambiguous. If the applied training load is suddenly increased, this may increase the risk for sports injury development, irrespective of the absolute amount of training. Indeed, little to no rigorous scientific evidence exists to support the hypothesis that fluctuations in training load, compared to absolute training load, are more important in explaining sports injury development. One reason for this could be that prospective data from scientific studies should be analyzed in a different manner. Time-to-event analysis is a useful statistical tool in which to analyze the influence of changing exposures on injury risk. However, the potential of time-to-event analysis remains insufficiently exploited in sports injury research. Therefore, the purpose of the present article was to present and discuss measures of association used in time-to-event analyses and to present the advanced concept of time-varying exposures and outcomes. In the paper, different measures of association, such as cumulative relative risk, cumulative risk difference, and the classical hazard rate ratio, are presented in a nontechnical manner, and suggestions for interpretation of study results are provided. To summarize, time-to-event analysis complements the statistical arsenal of sports injury prevention researchers, because it enables them to analyze the complex and highly dynamic reality of injury etiology, injury recurrence, and time to recovery across a range of sporting contexts.",27
"The inflammatory arthropathies share in common their tendency to produce marked alterations in skeletal remodelling and architecture. This review will focus on RA and the seronegative spondyloarthopathies (SpA), which share common features with respect to their tendency to produce localized bone destruction at sites of articular and peri-articular inflammation. However, there are significant differences in the skeletal pathology in these conditions, which include the unique involvement of the axial skeleton and the presence of inflammation in the extra-articular entheses in SpA. There also are differences in the pattern of bone formation and repair associated with the articular and peri-articular inflammation. This review will highlight the molecular and cellular processes that are involved in the pathogenesis of the skeletal pathology in these two forms of inflammatory arthritis with specific focus on the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the differential patterns of bone formation and repair.",107
"Putamen volume is seen to alter in neurological and psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's disease, depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and in individuals treated with antipsychotics. To establish a trend in volume changes in pathologic states, studies on factors influencing normal variation in a given population become essential. This study aimed to evaluate the normal variations in putamen volume in the Indian population and correlate them with the effects of age and sex. Bilateral symmetry was also evaluated. The study included MR images of 98 individuals aged 10-87 years. Axial sections of T2-weighted spin echo sequences were used to estimate putamen volume. The putamen was delineated manually and its volume was estimated using Cavalieri's principle. Linear regression and paired t-test were used to analyze data. Bilateral putamen volume reduced with age in both sexes. This was statistically significant (P0.05). Age and sex interaction was not found to be statistically significant. Hemispherical asymmetry was not established as the difference between the right and left putamen volume did not reach statistical significance in both males and females (P>0.05). In conclusion, this study demonstrated an age related decline in the volumes of both putamen in males and females. The rate of volume reduction was not affected by sex. The study failed to establish a significant sex difference and hemispherical asymmetry in putamen volume. Clin. Anat. 30:461-466, 2017. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",69
"Many vocational schools and universities offer lectures on non-stereoscopic 3D computer graphics (3DCG) animation production, as well as practical 3DCG software operation, modeling, and animation production. However, relatively few of these educational institutions provide lectures on stereoscopic 3D (S3D). To address this gap, we developed two 15-week syllabuses with educational materials, which focused on both knowledge based and skills-based education about 3DCG animation and S3D computer graphics (S3DCG) animation production, considering the potential employment of students in animation studios. Our investigation confirmed that the knowledge and skills of the subjects improved in this study, so we presented a report on the effectiveness of the educational materials for S3DCG animation production education at the Education Symposium of SIGGRAPH Asia 2015. By developing these educational materials, we reaffirmed the importance of camerawork skills education, which may be regarded as the cornerstone of 3DCG animation and S3DCG animation production. However, camerawork skills education in 3DCG animation classes remains limited in vocational schools and universities at present. We hypothesized that one of the reasons for the paucity of camerawork skills education is the lack of suitable educational materials for practical classes in the use of 3DCG software. Indeed, educational materials that allow teachers to begin camerawork skills education for 3DCG and S3DCG animation production without preparation are greatly lacking. Furthermore, modeling and character animation are regarded as essential before camerawork practice. Camerawork practice can be started immediately if sufficient educational materials are provided. The educational materials that we developed are suitable for S3DCG but also for 3DCG camerawork practice. In this study, we present the camerawork skills education and evaluation methods involved in the educational materials developed for the S3D lectures and for camerawork practical classes in S3DCG animation. We then discuss the experimental classes in which we used the educational materials and we report the results of S3D knowledge tests and camerawork practical tests, which were conducted in order to measure the learning/education outcomes for the participating subjects, as well as the results of a survey that focused on their subjective experiences. The experimental results clearly demonstrated improvements in both the knowledge and skills of subjects, thereby confirming the effectiveness of the camerawork educational materials. We suggest that if students with knowledge of S3D and 3DCG animation are well-practiced in the use of these educational materials, their skills in S3DCG camerawork would improve markedly. 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Despite a surge in psychological research on gratitude over the past several years, a number of important questions remain unanswered about this highly valued trait. It is largely unknown, for example, how gratitude is maintained in times of distress. This article supports and extends existing theory and research on the relevance of benefit detection (the perception of having received a gain rendered intentionally and voluntarily by another), by testing a model in which religious involvement in general, and religious coping in particular, can help sustain gratitude in the face of negative emotions. Across 2 studies-1 in a community/college student sample (n = 404) and another among individuals seeking psychological treatment (n = 122)-we found initial support for our model. Implications for further research on gratitude and other areas of positive psychology are discussed.",65
"Thick and hydrophilic microporous poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) affinity membranes were prepared for low-concentration gold separation by grafting thiourea on alkali treated PVDF resin. The modified polymer was easily cast into membranes by non-solvent induced phase separation through two coagulation processes, and the addition of N-methyl-2pyrrolidone into the second coagulation bath improved the pore size distribution effectively. The grafted polymer and membrane were characterized by FTIR, Raman, H-1 NMR, XPS, SEM and pore size distribution measurement. Static adsorption of Au (III) with the membranes followed pseudo-second order kinetics and Langmuir isotherm. Dynamic adsorption was investigated by using stacked membranes in the form of a membrane chromatography. The results showed that increasing the number of membrane layers improved the membrane bed utilization, which was attributed to the increased adsorption sites and a combined effect of reduced average membrane pore size and narrowed pore size distribution (PSD). The effect of PSD on performance of the membrane chromatography was further separated from that of the mean pore size, and it was shown that narrower PSD indeed was favorable. A new mathematical model based on dispersive mass transfer through the membrane pores and incorporating PSD was established. The model was found to be able to predict the membrane breakthrough behavior very well. Finally, the elution performance of gold laden membrane was studied, and an optimized formulation of the eluent consisting of thiourea and HCl was determined. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"Mobile technologies are increasingly adopted by information intensive organizations such as public police corporations to support the tasks of its employees, for information management and innovation. However, because police organizations are government organizations, technology decisions are largely made by managers and politicians with budget being a key factor. Therefore, whether the technologies adopted are suitable for police tasks, and if they enhance performance, is generally not assessed. The aim of this research is to establish if mobile technologies support police tasks, and if Tablet PCs especially are suitable for specialist police tasks of the Criminal Investigators and Sexual Offence and Child Abuse Units. Guided by an interpretive paradigm and the theory of task technology fit, this research explores the use of Tablet PCs by the two police units for improved performance. Because information is critical for police tasks, data collected via focus groups establishes the impact of these technologies on case investigations, information management, and the performance of these units with the use of Tablet PCs. The contribution this study makes to mobile information systems is that if technology dimensions are suitable for information based tasks, the outcome is virtualization of processes through which improved performance is achieved due to reduced costs, transparency, teamwork, and quick and informed decisions. The findings of this research can be used by police organizations, as well as by other organizations, for effective implementation of mobile technologies.",76
"Despite several offshore data are available, a general model of the central part of the Izmit Gulf is still a challenge and only few measurements have been done on the Hersek peninsula. This area is a key point not only because represents the only onshore segment of the North Anatolian Fault (NAF) within the central part of the Izmit Gulf, but also because the new Istanbul-Izmit highway will cross such gulf in this zone, with a suspension bridge, which will be the second longest bridge of such type in the world. This paper, integrating different analyses and data sets aims verifying at some of the present hypotheses. In particular, we propose the joint interpretation of new seismic reflection profiles from the Hersek Peninsula, as well as geophysical, remote sensing and geological data from the Izmit Gulf (Sea of Marmara, Turkey), close to the epicenter of the 1999, M-w 7.4 Izmit earthquake, to identify shallow-crustal deformations associated with the NAF. Our seismic reflection profiles, which are the first onshore two-components records within the Izmit Gulf, image compressive features that form a structural high cut by the principal deformation zone of the NAF. The observed transpressive stress pattern appears to be the main factor contributing to the physiography of the peninsula, together with the growth northwards of the Yalakdere River deposits. We demonstrate that this pattern is compatible with an 8 degrees bending of the NAF strand. Based on these new data, we propose a kinematic model for the evolution of this structure around the Hersek Peninsula during Holocene, and we test our reconstruction using a finite-elements numerical simulation model of the stress/strain distribution.",97
"Dietary patterns influence various cardiometabolic risk factors, including body weight, lipoprotein concentrations, and function, blood pressure, glucose-insulin homeostasis, oxidative stress, inflammation, and endothelial health. The Mediterranean diet can be described as a dietary pattern characterized by the high consumption of plant-based foods, olive oil as the main source of fat, low-to-moderate consumption of fish, dairy products and poultry, low consumption of red and processed meat, and low-to-moderate consumption of wine with meals. The American Diabetes Association and the American Heart Association recommend Mediterranean diet for improving glycemic control and cardiovascular risk factors in type 2 diabetes. Prospective studies show that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with a 20-23 % reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes, while the results of randomized controlled trials show that Mediterranean diet reduces glycosylated hemoglobin levels by 0.30-0.47 %, and is also associated with a 28-30 % reduced risk for cardiovascular events. The mechanisms by which Mediterranean diet produces its cardiometabolic benefits in type 2 diabetes are, for the most, anti-inflammatory and antioxidative: increased consumption of high-quality foods may cool down the activation of the innate immune system, by reducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines while increasing that of anti-inflammatory cytokines. This may favor the generation of an anti-inflammatory milieu, which in turn may improve insulin sensitivity in the peripheral tissues and endothelial function at the vascular level and ultimately act as a barrier to the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and development of atherosclerosis.",121
"The paper describes a method and a device for a current permanent observation of driver's response in the road traffic was described. The task of presented system is not only the ""on-line"" analysis of the human behavior but primarily the determination of the physiological changes and their fuzzy classification in order to determine the states considered sub-critical. The article is based on authors research and results of experiments, related to the international scientific state of art, in terms of excessive fatigue and aggression as essential biocybernetic factors increasing the road accident risk. A variant of the warning system for notification of driver's psychophysical condition changes was presented. The system is based on a revised analysis of the human metabolism under a monotonous long-term load. The results of simulations and real measurements are prerequisites for the development of the presented system structure.",32
"The paper is concerned with analyzing data from an experimental antipodal laser-based chaos shift-keying communication system. Binary messages are embedded in a chaotically behaving laser wave, which is transmitted through a fiberoptic cable and are decoded at the receiver using a second laser synchronized with the emitter laser. Instrumentation in the experimental system makes it particularly interesting to be able to empirically analyze both optical noise and synchronization error as well as bit error rate. Both the noise and error are found to significantly depart in distribution from independent Gaussian. The conclusion from bit error rate results is that the antipodal laser chaos shift-keying system can offer a feasible approach to optical communication. The non-Gaussian optical noise and synchronous error results are a challenge to current theoretical modeling.",57
"The role of emotion regulation in subclinical symptoms of mental disorders in adolescence is not yet well understood. This meta-analytic review examines the relationship between the habitual use of prominent adaptive emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal, problem solving, and acceptance) and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies (avoidance, suppression, and rumination) with depressive and anxiety symptoms in adolescence. Analyzing 68 effect sizes from 35 studies, we calculated overall outcomes across depressive and anxiety symptoms as well as psychopathology-specific outcomes. Age was examined as a continuous moderator via meta-regression models. The results from random effects analyses revealed that the habitual use of all emotion regulation strategies was significantly related to depressive and anxiety symptoms overall, with the adaptive emotion regulation strategies showing negative associations (i.e., less symptoms) with depressive and anxiety symptoms whereas the maladaptive emotion regulation strategies showed positive associations (i.e., more symptoms). A less frequent use of adaptive and a more frequent use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies were associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms comparably in the respective directions. Regarding the psychopathology-specific outcomes, depressive and anxiety symptoms displayed similar patterns across emotion regulation strategies showing the strongest negative associations with acceptance, and strongest positive associations with avoidance and rumination. The findings underscore the relevance of adaptive and also maladaptive emotion regulation strategies in depressive and anxiety symptoms in youth, and highlight the need to further investigate the patterns of emotion regulation as a potential transdiagnostic factor.",81
"There are three main magnet systems in Wendelstein 7-X, comprising in total 85 coils arranged in 22 independent circuits fed by steady state power supplies. The superconducting coil system creates the main magnetic field and consists of 70 coils, grouped in seven electrical circuits with ten coils each with an inductance of about one Henry. Each circuit is fed by one power supply with a maximum current of 20 kA and a maximum voltage of +/-30 V. The power supplies were tested so far using copper coils with one m Omega and one mH. The integral commissioning of the completed coil circuits has been running since the end of April 2015. The second coil system is the so-called trim coil system, intended for enhanced experimental flexibility and error field corrections. It consists of five independently powered copper coils which are placed on the outer side of the cryostat. They will be operated with currents of up to 1.95 kA. Each power supply is connected to the 400 V three phase grid and consists of an input transformer with dual secondaries connected to two three phase systems, followed by two diode six pulse diode bridges, configured as a 12 pulse rectifier. The power conversion is accomplished with paralleled H-bridges using IGBT. The full scale ratings of a power supply are +1 2200 A(dc) and +/-230 V(dc). Tests at full current were performed on the power supplies using dummy loads, and successful tests were performed on the actual trim coils up to 2/3 of rated current in November 2014. The third magnet system is the divertor control coil system. The ten normal conducting copper coils are situated inside the plasma vessel behind the divertor targets and are arranged in ten independent circuits. The 12 pulse system of these power supplies is generated in the same manner as the power supplies for the superconducting coils, followed by rectifier diodes. The inverter stage is made up of an H-bridge converter with 12 MOSFET transistors in parallel per branch. The current rating of the power supply is a DC value up to +/-2500 A, which can be modulated by an AC current of up to 625 A with frequencies up to 20 Hz. The final commissioning of the control coil system has been started in February 2015.",45
"Bipolar disorder (BPD) and schizophrenia (SCH) show similar neuropsychiatric behavioral disturbances, including impaired social interaction and communication, seen in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with multiple overlapping genetic and environmental influences implicated in risk and course of illness. GeneAnalytics software was used for pathway analysis and genetic profiling to characterize common susceptibility genes obtained from published lists for ASD (792 genes), BPD (290 genes) and SCH (560 genes). Rank scores were derived from the number and nature of overlapping genes, gene-disease association, tissue specificity and gene functions subdivided into categories (e.g., diseases, tissues or functional pathways). Twenty-three genes were common to all three disorders and mapped to nine biological Superpathways including Circadian entrainment (10 genes, score = 37.0), Amphetamine addiction (five genes, score = 24.2), and Sudden infant death syndrome (six genes, score = 24.1). Brain tissues included the medulla oblongata (11 genes, score = 2.1), thalamus (10 genes, score = 2.0) and hypothalamus (nine genes, score = 2.0) with six common genes (BDNF, DRD2, CHRNA7, HTR2A, SLC6A3, and TPH2). Overlapping genes impacted dopamine and serotonin homeostasis and signal transduction pathways, impacting mood, behavior and physical activity level. Converging effects on pathways governing circadian rhythms support a core etiological relationship between neuropsychiatric illnesses and sleep disruption with hypoxia and central brain stem dysfunction.",115
"A range of risk factors lead to opioid use and substance-related problems (SRP) including childhood maltreatment, elevated impulsivity, and psychopathology. These constructs are highly interrelated such that childhood maltreatment is associated with elevated impulsivity and trauma-related psychopathology such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and impulsivity particularly urgency and PTSD are related. Prior work has examined the association between these constructs and substance-related problems independently and it is unclear how these multi-faceted constructs (i.e., maltreatment types and positive and negative urgency) are associated with one another and SRP. The current study used structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the relations among childhood maltreatment, trait urgency, PTSD symptoms, and SRP in a sample of individuals with a history of opioid use. An initial model that included paths from each type of childhood maltreatment, positive and negative urgency, PTSD and SRP did not fit the data well. A pruned model with excellent fit was identified that suggested emotional abuse, positive urgency, and negative urgency were directly related to PTSD symptoms and only PTSD symptoms were directly related to SRP. Furthermore, significant indirect effects suggested that emotional abuse and negative urgency were related to SRP via PTSD symptom severity. These results suggest that PTSD plays an important role in the severity of SRP. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",104
"Anxiety disorders are one of the most common and debilitating mental illnesses worldwide. Growing evidence indicates an age-dependent rise in the incidence of anxiety disorders from adolescence through adulthood, suggestive of underlying neurodevelopmental mechanisms. Kappa opioid receptors (KORs) are known to contribute to the development and expression of anxiety; however, the functional role of KORs in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a brain structure critical in mediating anxiety, particularly across ontogeny, are unknown. Using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology in acute brain slices from adolescent (postnatal day (P) 30-45) and adult (P60+) male Sprague-Dawley rats, we found that the KOR agonist, U69593, increased the frequency of GABA(A)-mediated spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in the adolescent BLA, without an effect in the adult BLA or on sIPSC amplitude at either age. The KOR effect was blocked by the KOR antagonist, nor-BNI, which alone did not alter GABA transmission at either age, and the effect of the KOR agonist was TTX-sensitive. Additionally, KOR activation did not alter glutamatergic transmission in the BLA at either age. In contrast, U69593 inhibited sIPSC frequency in the central amygdala (CeA) at both ages, without altering sIPSC amplitude. Western blot analysis of KOR expression indicated that KOR levels were not different between the two ages in either the BLA or CeA. This is the first study to provide compelling evidence for a novel and unique neuromodulatory switch in one of the primary brain regions involved in initiating and mediating anxiety that may contribute to the ontogenic rise in anxiety disorders.

"Mood regulation is known to be affected by the change of seasons. Recent research findings have suggested that mood regulation may be influenced by the function of circadian clocks. In addition, the activity of brown adipocytes has been hypothesized to contribute to mood regulation. Here, the overarching link to mood disorders might be the circadian clock protein nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1.",71
"Aims: Verrucous carcinoma (VC) is a variant of well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and in the anal region is regarded as synonymous with giant condyloma (Buschke-Lowenstein tumour) (BLT). Aetiology, diagnostic criteria and clinical behaviour of both lesions are controversial. Recent studies suggest that VC at other sites is not associated with human papillomaviruses (HPV). We hypothesized that anal VC is also not related to HPV, while BLT is a HPV-induced lesion. Methods and results: Ten cases of VC and four cases of BLT were included. Several techniques were used for HPV detection: in-situ hybridization for HPV6, 11, 16 and 18, six different polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols for detection of at least 89 HPV types from alpha-, beta-, gamma- and mu-PV genera and in-situ hybridization for high-risk HPV E6/E7 mRNA; p16 immunohistochemistry and morphometric analysis were also performed. Alpha-, gamma- and mu-PVs were not found in any case of VC, while HPV6 was detected in all cases of BLT. p16 overexpression was not present in any of the lesions. Among microscopic features, only the absence of koilocytosis and enlarged spinous cells seem to be useful to distinguish VC from BLT. Conclusions: Our results suggest that anal VC, similarly to VC at other sites, is not associated with HPV infection, and must be distinguished from BLT, which is associated with low-risk HPV. Only with well-set diagnostic criteria will it be possible to ascertain clinical behaviour and optimal treatment for both lesions.",37
"The immune function of AMIGO2 is currently unknown. Here, we revealed novel roles of AMIGO2 in modulating T-cell functions and EAE using Amigo2-knockout (AMG2K0) mice. Amigo2 was abundantly expressed by murine T helper (Th) cells. Its deficiency impaired transplanted T-cell infiltration into the secondary lymphoid organs and dampened Th-cell activation, but promoted splenic Th-cell proliferation and abundancy therein. AMG2K0 Th cells had respectively elevated T-bet in Th1- and GATA-3 in Th2-lineage during early Th-cell differentiation, accompanied with increased IFN-gamma and IL-10 but decreased IL-17A production. AMG2K0 mice exhibited ameliorated EAE, dampened spinal T-cell accumulation, decreased serum IL-17A levels and enhanced splenic IL-10 production. Adoptive transfer of encephalitogenic AMG2K0 T cells induced milder EAE and dampened spinal Th-cell accumulation and Tnf expression. Mechanistically, Amigo2-overexpression in 293T cells dampened NF-kB transcriptional activity, while Amigo2-deficiency enhanced Akt but suppressed GSK-3 beta phosphorylation and promoted nuclear translocations of NF-kB and NFAT1 in Th-cells. Collectively, our data demonstrate that AMIGO2 is important in regulating T-cell functions and EAE, and may be harnessed as a potential therapeutic target for multiple sclerosis.

"Angiogenesis, a process induced by hypoxia in visceral white adipose tissues (vWAT) in the context of obesity, mediates obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction and insulin resistance. Chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH) and sustained hypoxia (SH) induce body weight reductions and insulin resistance of different magnitudes, suggesting different hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha-related activity. Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice (n = 10-12/group) were exposed to either IH, SH, or room air (RA). vWAT were analyzed for insulin sensitivity (phosphorylated (pAKT)/AKT), HIF-1 alpha transcription using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing, angiogenesis using immunohistochemistry, and gene expression of different fat cell markers and HIF-1 alpha gene targets using quantitative polymerase chain reaction or microarrays. Body and vWAT weights were reduced in hypoxia (SH >IH >RA; P>>SH = RA; P < 0.001). IH induces preferential whitening of vWAT, as opposed to prominent browning in SH. Unlike SH, IH elicits early HIF-1 alpha activity that is unsustained over time and is accompanied by concurrent vascular rarefaction, inflammation, and insulin resistance. Thus, the dichotomous changes in HIF-1 alpha transcriptional activity and brown/beige/white fat balance in IH and SH should enable exploration of mechanisms by which altered sympathetic outflow, such as that which occurs in apneic patients, results in whitening, rather than the anticipated browning of adipose tissues that occurs in SH.",37
"Background: Myocardial native T1 measurements are likely influenced by intramyocardial blood. Since blood T1 is both variable and longer compared to myocardial T1, this will degrade the precision of myocardial T1 measurements. Precision could be improved by correction, but the amount of correction and the optimal blood T1 variables to correct with are unknown. We hypothesized that an appropriate correction would reduce the standard deviation (SD) of native myocardial T1. Methods: Consecutive patients (n = 400) referred for CMR with known or suspected heart disease were split into a derivation cohort for model construction (n = 200, age 51 +/- 18 years, 50% male) and a validation cohort for assessing model performance (n = 200, age 48 +/- 17 years, 50% male). Exclusion criteria included focal septal abnormalities. A Modified Look-Locker inversion recovery sequence (MOLLI, 1.5 T Siemens Aera) was used to acquire T1 and T1* maps. T1 and T1* maps were used to measure native myocardial T1, and blood T1 and T1*. A multivariate linear regression correction model was implemented using blood measurement of R1 (1/T1), R1* (1/T1*) or hematocrit. The correction model from the derivation cohort was applied to the validation cohort, and assessed for reduction in variability with the F-test. Results: Blood [LV + RV] mean R1, mean R1* and hematocrit correlated with myocardial T1 (Pearson's r, range 0.37 to 0.45, p < 0.05 for all) in both the derivation and validation cohorts respectively, suggesting that myocardial T1 measurements are influenced by intramyocardial blood. Mean myocardial native T1 did not differ between the derivation and validation cohorts (1030 +/- 42.6 ms and 1023 +/- 45.2 ms respectively, p = 0.07). In the derivation cohort, correction using blood mean R1 and mean R1* yielded a decrease in myocardial T1 SD (45.2 ms to 36.6 ms, p = 0.03). When the model from the derivation cohort was applied to the validation cohort, the SD reduction was maintained (39.3 ms, p = 0.049). This 13% reduction in measurement variability leads to a 23% reduction in sample size to detect a 50 ms difference in native myocardial T1. Conclusions: Correcting native myocardial T1 for R1 and R1* of blood improves the precision of myocardial T1 measurement by similar to 13%, and could consequently improve disease detection and reduce sample size needs for clinical research.",129
"Background: Retention in care is the most challenging step along the HIV care continuum. Many patients who engage in care and achieve viral suppression have care interruptions, characterized by moving in and out of care (""churn""). Poor retention has clinical consequences and contributes to new HIV transmissions, but how to predict or prevent it remains elusive. This study sought to understand the relationship between individual-and structural-level barriers, and poor retention for persons living with HIV/AIDS in Atlanta, GA. Methods: We administered a survey, through interviews, with HIV-infected patients continuously retained in care for 6 years (""continuouslyretained,"" n = 32) and patients with recent gaps in care (""unretained"" n = 27). We assessed individual-level protective factors for successful engagement (self-efficacy, resilience, perceived social support, and disclosure), risk factors for poor engagement (substance use, mental illness, and stigma), and structural/systemic-level barriers (financial and housing instability, transportation, food insecurity, communication barriers, and incarceration history). Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare the 2 populations. Results: Both continuously retained and unretained populations had high rates of prior viral suppression but few unretained patients were virologically suppressed upon return to care (11%). Younger age, crack cocaine use, food insecurity, financial instability, housing instability, and phone number changes in the past year were significantly more likely to be present in the unretained population. Conclusions: Our findings suggest the need for targeted risk assessment tools to predict the highest-risk patients for poor retention whereby public health interventions can be directed to those individuals.",132
"Lumbosacral spina bifida is a common debilitating birth defect whose multiple causes are poorly understood. Here, we provide the first genetic delineation of cholinergic nicotinic receptor alpha7 (Chrna7) expression and link the ablation of the Chrna7 cell lineage to this condition in the mouse. Using homologous recombination, an IRES-Cre bi-cistronic cassette was introduced into the 3' noncoding region of Chrna7 (Chrna7:Cre) for identifying cell lineages expressing this gene. This lineage first appears at embryonic day E9.0 in rhombomeres 3 and 5 of the neural tube and extends to cell subsets in most tissues by E14.5. Ablation of the Chrna7:Cre cell lineage in embryos from crosses with conditionally expressed attenuated diphtheria toxin results in precise developmental defects including omphalocele (89%) and open spina bifida (SB; 80%). We hypothesized that like humans, this defect would be modified by environmental compounds not only folic acid or choline but also nicotine. Prenatal chronic oral nicotine administration substantially worsened the defect to often include the rostral neural tube. In contrast, supplementation of the maternal diet with 2% choline decreased SB prevalence to 38% and dramatically reduced the defect severity. Folic acid supplementation only trended towards a reduced SB frequency. The omphalocele was unaffected by these interventions. These studies identify the Chrna7 cell lineage as participating in posterior neuropore closure and present a novel model of lower SB that can be substantially modified by the prenatal environment.

"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common cause of hepatic steatosis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Both metabolic syndrome (MetS) and intestinal inflammation are implicated in NAFLD pathogenesis. We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with IBD and NAFLD seen in our health system from January 1997 to December 2011 to examine associations between IBD severity and phenotype; MetS; and NAFLD fibrosis as estimated by the NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS). A total of 84 patients were included in our analysis (24 UC, 60 CD). 23% of patients had MetS. IBD patients with MetS were significantly older at the time of IBD diagnosis (44 vs. 33, p = 0.005) and NAFLD diagnosis (55 vs. 47, p = 0.018). IBD patients with MetS had higher ALT (54 vs. 38 U/L, p = 0.02) and AST (52 vs. 35 U/L, p = 0.004). Comparing MetS patients to non-MetS IBD patients, there was no significant difference between IBD medication use (i.e., steroids, anti-TNFs, and immunomodulators) or NAFLD medication use, other than statins. Both UC and CD patients with concomitant MetS had significantly higher NFS scores than non-MetS patients: UC (-0.4 vs. -2.5, p = 0.02) and CD (-0.8 vs. -2.3, p = 0.03). IBD disease severity, disease location, or IBD medication use was associated with NAFLD severity. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that NAFLD severity in both UC and CD IBD patients is associated with the presence of MetS but not with the severity of IBD.",118

"Many big data applications are usually categorized as irregular. Irregular problems feature unpredictable and unstructured properties in terms of the program flow, data access pattern and typically use pointer-based data structures such as graphs. The problems are data, compute and communication intensive in nature. The algorithms are therefore designed and implemented on high performance architectures. The first stage of the parallel algorithm design is data partitioning. In this stage, the data is sub-divided into equally sized disjoint elements such that the communication volume among the processors is minimized. If the data is represented as a graph, it can be stated as the graph partitioning problem, which is NP-hard. In this work, we consider the metaheuristic, ant brooding algorithm based on larval sorting by ants to solve the graph partitioning problem. The parallel ant brooding algorithm is implemented on a cluster using MIT's Julia language. We test the parallel algorithm on different benchmark and synthetic graphs. We compare our Julia parallel implementation with Julia sequential and C sequential implementations. We found that the performance of Julia is comparable to C with good scalability, and the parallel Julia implementation achieves speedup greater than 1 for a synthetic graph with 200 vertices and 1000 edges.",35
"One of the main challenges on Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is to reach an appropriate acceptance level of the assistive systems, as well as to analyze and monitor end user tasks in a feasible and efficient way. The development and evaluation of AAL solutions based on user-centered perspective help to achive these goals. In this work, we have designed a methodology to integrate and develop analytics user-centered tools into assistive systems. An analysis software tool gathers information of end users from adapted psychological questionnaires and naturalistic observation of their own context. The aim is to enable an in-deep analysis focused on improving the life quality of elderly people and their caregivers.",92
"This work was undertaken to determine the genesis and role of creativity (Cr) in the formation of mental qualities that gave Homo sapiens (HS) the evolutionary advantages in intra- and interspecific competition during the period of the intraspecific bifurcation of hominids on the border of the Middle and Upper Paleolithic. Creativity allowed HS to design the adaptive forms of purposeful behavior corresponding to the conditions and the degree of uncertainty, and create stable mental constructs, in the absence of perceptual sources, that do not require reactive behavior. Visualization of a target image, which originally had an applied and instructional value in the process of semantic filling, was transformed into a symbol, which, getting the qualities of the perceptual source, loses its connection to the primary value and initiates the creation of qualitatively new needs for hominids: bilateral (direct and inverse) relations in the system ""subject-symbol."" The ability to produce the prognostic hypothesis with expansion of the operating range of the HS mind allowed the ability to search and change the tactics of an adaptive behavior, which gave the results: improvements in quality of life and an increase in life expectancy (genetically fixed); domination in intra- and interspecific competition; the emergence of new operating systems of the psyche, including the emergence and development of symbolic thought. As a criterion of creativity, with the potential ability for quantitative measurement, we propose the value of deviation of creative oscillations (""proposal"" of a creative individual) from the boundaries between stereotypes: for the cognition sphere, a deviation from the border between recognizable and unrecognizable; for the social sphere, between acceptable and unacceptable.",68
"This study aimed to determine the prevalence of clinical depression as defined by ICD-10 criteria in all patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) referred to a sleep center. Prospective general and sleep evaluations were conducted in 447 consecutive patients referred to our sleep center during the first quarter of 2008. Inclusion criteria were Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) >9, completion of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) with a score >= 14 and World Health Organization WHO-5 Well-Being Index (WHO-5)9. Out of these, 85 met the combined screening criterion BDI II >= 14 and WHO-5 <= 13. Eighty-one patients underwent a psychiatric examination by psychiatric sleep specialists. In 21.5 % of the sample, clinical depression was diagnosed. Other complaints existed in 12 % (n = 10); 7 % (n = 6) of patients had a different psychiatric diagnosis. The prevalence of clinical depression according to ICD-10 criteria in a selected clinical sample (referred to the sleep center) was 21.5 %. Mood scales tend to overestimate complaints as compared to psychiatric consultation. Interdisciplinary cooperation is recommended for both OSA patients with symptoms of depression and depressed patients with treatment resistance.",69
"Genetics and genomics are increasingly relevant to primary healthcare but training is unavailable to many practitioners. Education that can be accessed by practitioners without cost or travel is essential. The Gen-Equip project was formed to provide effective education in genetics for primary healthcare in Europe and so improve patient care. Partners include patient representatives and specialists in genetics and primary care from six countries. Here, we report the progress and challenges involved in creating a European online educational program in genetics.",34
"Despite limited evidence, complementary and alternative medicine treatments are popular in autism spectrum disorder. The aim of this review was to summarize the available evidence on complementary and alternative medicine use frequency in autism spectrum disorder. A systematic search of three electronic databases was performed. All research studies in English or German reporting data on the frequency of complementary and alternative medicine use in individuals with autism spectrum disorder were included. Two independent reviewers searched the literature, extracted information on study design and results, and assessed study quality using an established quality assessment tool. Twenty studies with a total of 9540 participants were included. The prevalence of any complementary and alternative medicine use ranged from 28% to 95% (median: 54%). Special diets or dietary supplements (including vitamins) were the most frequent complementary and alternative medicine treatments, ranking first in 75% of studies. There was some evidence for a higher prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine use in autism spectrum disorder compared to other psychiatric disorders and the general population. Approximately half of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder use complementary and alternative medicine. Doctors should be aware of this and should discuss complementary and alternative medicine use with patients and their carers, especially as the evidence is mixed and some complementary and alternative medicine treatments are potentially harmful.",113
"Aberrant expression of miR-15a-5p has been frequently reported in some cancers excluding lung cancer. The role and its molecular mechanism of miR-15a-5p in lung cancer have not been reported. In this study, we explored the effects of miR-15a-5p overexpression on apoptosis and invasion in lung cancer cells. The mRNA level of miR-15a-5p in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) lines was determined by real-time PCR. The miR-15a-5p mimic was transiently transfected into lung cancer cells using Lipofectamine (TM) 2000 reagent. Subsequently, the Brdu-ELISA results showed that introduction of miR-15a-5p inhibited cell proliferation. In addition, miR-15a-5p overexpression could also inhibit EMT of A549 and H460 cells. qRT-PCR were used to determined the expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 (MMP-2 and -9) in lung cancer cells. Next, we found that NF-kappa B1 expression was evidently reduced by up-regulation of miR-15a-5p. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that the NF-kappa B1 was a potential target gene of miR-15a-5p. Luciferase reporter assay further confirmed that miR-15a-5p could directly target the 3' UTR of NF-kappa B1. In conclusion, miR15a-5p suppresses proliferation and metastasis in lung cancer cells by down-regulation of NF-kappa B1 and overexpression of miR-15a-5p might be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of lung cancer in the future.",42
"The explosion of ever increasing geospatial data is today met with the challenge of maintaining it in spatial databases and utilization of traditional methods of spatial data processing. The sheer volume and complexity of spatial databases makes them an ideal candidate for use with parallel and distributed processing architectures. There is a lot of enthusiasm toward using MapReduce paradigm and distributed computing for processing of large volumes of vector data. As spatial data cannot be indexed using traditional B-tree structures used by R/DBMS, several libraries such as JSI (Java Spatial Index), libspatialindex and SpatiaLite depend upon advanced data structures such as R/R*-tree, Quad-tree and their variants for spatial indexing. These indexing mechanisms have also been natively incorporated in frameworks such as Spatial Hadoop, Hadoop GIS SATO and GeoSpark. Additionally, most widely used open source RDBMS such as MySQL, Postgres and SQLite incorporate spatial indexing using extensions/add-ons. In this paper, we benchmark and compare the performance of various spatial indexing mechanisms in addition to evaluating the performance of distributed frameworks for planet sized datasets. We conclude by highlighting the characteristics of spatial tools and frameworks for better selection and implementation of R-tree indexing in a big geo-spatial processing system.",2
"This paper presents the design and test results of an eight-channel prototype integrated circuit chip intended to greatly simplify the pulse-processing electronics needed for large arrays of scintillation detectors. Because the chip design employs (user-controlled) multi-region charge integration, particle identification is incorporated into the basic design. Each channel on the chip also contains a time-to-voltage Converter which provides relative time information. The puise-height integrals and the relative time are all stored on capacitors and are either reset, after a user controlled time, or sequentially read out if acquisition of the event is desired. Each of the three pulse-height sub-channels consists of a gated integrator with eight programmable charging rates and an externally programmable gate generator that defines the start (with four time ranges) and width (with four time ranges) of the gate relative to an external discriminator signal. The chip supports three triggering modes, two time ranges, two power modes, and produces four sparsified analog pulse trains (three for the integrators and another for the time) with synchronized addresses for off-chip digitization with a pipelined ADC. The eight-channel prototype chip occupies an area of 2.8 mm x 5.7 mm, dissipates 60 mW (low-power mode), and was fabricated in the AMI 0.5-mu m process (C5N). (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"Background: The fruit of Lycium cliinense (LC), one of the most popular natural materials, has been used to counter the effects of musculoskeletal diseases in oriental medicine. In particular, this fruit is known to have antiaging effects, which is of significant interest to the research community. The purpose of our investigation was to observe and confirm the ameliorative effect of LC on osteoporosis, which was verified in this in vivo study. Methods: Female ICR mice aged 5 weeks were surgically ovariectomized (OVX) to induce osteoporosis. After 7 weeks of induction, oral administration with I mg/kg and 100 mg/kg LC was continued for 6 weeks. At the end of the experiment, the levels of bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) were estimated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed; additionally, serum osteocalcin and calcium concentrations were analyzed. Results: LC treatment significantly reduced the deterioration of BMC and BMD compared with OVX mice. Histological analysis showed that LC ameliorated osteoporosis including the hypertrophy of the epiphyseal plate. Additionally, decreased serum osteocalcin as well as the calcium levels recovered following the administration of LC. Conclusion: These results demonstrated that LC ameliorates osteoporosis in OVX mice by improving several important parameters including BMC, BMD, and bone-turnover markers such as osteocalcin and calcium levels in serum.

"PRDM proteins have emerged as important regulators of disease and developmental processes. To gain insight into the mechanistic actions of the PRDM family, we have performed comprehensive characterization of a prototype member protein, the histone methyltransferase PRDM9, using biochemical, biophysical and chemical biology techniques. In the present paper we report the first known molecular characterization of a PRDM9-methylated recombinant histone octamer and the identification of new histone substrates for the enzyme. A single C321P mutant of the PR/SET domain was demonstrated to significantly weaken PRDM9 activity. Additionally, we have optimized a robust biochemical assay amenable to high-throughput screening to facilitate the generation of small-molecule chemical probes for this protein family. The present study has provided valuable insight into the enzymology of an intrinsically active PRDM protein.",36
"A positive selection system was developed for Agrobacterium-mediated trasnsformation of using hypocotyl segments of aseptic seedlings of chinese cabbage as explants, regenerated plants with kanamycin resistance were obtained. The transformed plants with CryIA( c) (Bt) gene were confirmed by Southern blotting analysis, indicating the integration of the transgene into the cabbage genome. Majority of the transgenic plants had only a single copy of the inserted CryIA( c) gene. Leaf section bioassays showed that resistance against larvae of diamondback moth in CryIA( c) transgenic cabbage was significantly enhanced. The inheritance patterns of the transgene in T(1) offspring of transgenic cabbage were investigated using PCR analysis and kanamycin resistance test on young seedling leaves.",39
"In c-type cytochromes, heme becomes covalently attached to the polypeptide chain by a reaction between the vinyl groups of the heme and cysteine thiols from the protein. There are two such cytochromes in mitochondria: cytochrome c and cytochrome c1. The heme attachment is a post-translational modification that is catalysed by different biogenesis proteins in different organisms. Three types of biogenesis system are found or predicted in mitochondria: System I (the cytochrome c maturation system); System III (termed holocytochrome c synthase (HCCS) or heme lyase); and System V. This review focuses primarily on cytochrome c maturation in mitochondria containing HCCS (System III). It describes what is known about the enzymology and substrate specificity of HCCS; the role of HCCS in human disease; import of HCCS into mitochondria; import of apocytochromes c and c1 into mitochondria and the close relationships with HCCS-dependent heme attachment; and the role of the fungal cytochrome c biogenesis accessory protein Cyc2. System V is also discussed; this is the postulated mitochondrial cytochrome c biogenesis system of trypanosomes and related organisms. No cytochrome c biogenesis proteins have been identified in the genomes of these organisms whose c-type cytochromes also have a unique mode of heme attachment.",36
"Parents are increasingly turning to online health forums to discuss their concerns over their children's health and seek advice on health decisions. This study examines the characteristics of elaboration in online forum discussions between parents about the rotavirus vaccine. It establishes the types of central and peripheral message cues parents generated, the extent of their elaboration, and how these exchanges are associated with parents' decisions on their children's vaccination. The results indicated that forum users employed both central and peripheral cues as a joint process when generating information intended to help other parents gain knowledge and make vaccination decisions. Issue-relevant arguments important to vaccination decision included the vaccine's necessity, side effects and efficacy. Peripheral cues including site-generated sorting cues were associated with posts featuring greater elaboration. New parents had the most doubts, asking the most questions about vaccine issues. Their elaboration, however, was the weakest. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",117
"Entropic lattice Boltzmann methods were introduced to overcome the stability issues of lattice Boltzmann models for high Reynolds number turbulent flows. However, to date their validity has been investigated only for simple flows due to the lack of appropriate boundary conditions. We present here an extension of these models to complex flows involving curved and moving boundaries in three dimensions. Apart from a thorough investigation of resolved and under-resolved simulations for periodic flow and turbulent flow in a round pipe, we study in detail the set-up of a simplified internal combustion engine with a valve/piston arrangement. This arrangement allows us to probe the non-trivial interactions between various flow features such as jet breakup, jet-wall interaction, and formation and breakup of large vortical structures, among others. Besides an order of magnitude reduction in computational costs, when compared to state-of-the-art direct numerical simulations (DNS), these methods come with the additional advantage of using static Cartesian meshes also for moving objects, which reduces the complexity of the scheme. Going beyond first-order statistics, a detailed comparison of mean and root-mean-square velocity profiles with high-order spectral element DNS simulations and experimental data shows excellent agreement, highlighting the accuracy and reliability of the method for resolved simulations. Moreover, we show that the implicit subgrid features of the entropic lattice Boltzmann method can be utilized to further reduce the grid sizes and the computational costs, providing an alternative to modern modelling approaches such as large-eddy simulations for complex flows.",87
"Although robots are becoming an ever-growing presence in society, we do not hold the same expectations for robots as we do for humans, nor do we treat them the same. As such, the ability to recognize cues to human animacy is fundamental for guiding social interactions. We review literature that demonstrates cortical networks associated with person perception, action observation and mentalizing are sensitive to human animacy information. In addition, we show that most prior research has explored stimulus properties of artificial agents (humanness of appearance or motion), with less investigation into knowledge cues (whether an agent is believed to have human or artificial origins). Therefore, currently little is known about the relationship between stimulus and knowledge cues to human animacy in terms of cognitive and brain mechanisms. Using fMRI, an elaborate belief manipulation, and human and robot avatars, we found that knowledge cues to human animacy modulate engagement of person perception and mentalizing networks, while stimulus cues to human animacy had less impact on social brain networks. These findings demonstrate that self-other similarities are not only grounded in physical features but are also shaped by prior knowledge. More broadly, as artificial agents fulfil increasingly social roles, a challenge for roboticists will be to manage the impact of pre-conceived beliefs while optimizing human-like design.",63
"Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an inflammatory, chronically relapsing, and intensively pruritic skin disease that affect 10-30% of the global population. Angelicae dahuricae Radix (ADR) has been reported to be anti-inflammatory in Korean Medicine. In the present study, we investigated whether ADR suppresses the progression of AD in animal model. Methods: AD was induced by 2, 4-Dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB). ADR was orally administered to mice to study the effect of ADR on AD. Histological Analysis, immunohistochemistry, blood analysis, RT-PCR, and ELISA assay were performed. Results: ADR significantly suppressed AD-like symptoms in BALB/c mice: ADR decreased skin thickness and spleen weight of mice. ADR reduced infiltration of mast cells, inflammatory cells and CD4+ cells into mouse skin. ADR lowered the number of WBCs in the blood of mice. ADR reduced the levels of IgE, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12 in mice serum. ADR down-regulated mRNA expression of IL-4, IL-6 and TNF-alpha in mouse skin tissue. Conclusion: Our present study clearly indicates that ADR suppresses the progression of AD induced by DNCB in BALB/c mice. This suggests that ADR might be a useful drug for the treatment of AD.",110
"Background: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients with early repolarization (ER) pattern are at higher risk of ventricular arrhythmia, yet the genetic background of this situation has not been well investigated. Here we report novel trigenic mutations detected in a Chinese family of obstructive HCM with ER and short QT syndrome (SQTS). Methods: Proband and family members underwent detailed medical assessments. DNAs were extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes for genetic screening with next generation method. The functional characterization of the mutation was conducted in TSA201 cells with patch-clamp experiment. Results: The proband was a 52-year-old male who had a ER pattern ECG in inferioral-lateral leads with atrioventricular block and QTc of 356 ms. He also suffered from severe left ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction. Targeted sequencing revealed trigenic mutations: c.700G >A/p.E234K in DES, c.2966G >A/p.R989H in MYPN, and c.5918G >C/p.R1973P in CACNA1C. All mutations were also detected in his daughter with ER and mild myocardium hypertrophy. The CACNA1C-R1973P mutation caused significant reduction (68.4%) of I-Ca compared to CACNA1C-WT (n = 14 and 14, P < 0.05). The computer modeling showed that all 3 mutations were highly disease-causing. The proband received the CRT-D (cardiac resynchronizing therapy) implantation, which lowered the left ventricular outflow tract gradient (LVOTG, 124 mmHg pre vs. 27 mmHg post) and restored the LV function (LVEF 40% pre vs. 63% post). Conclusions: The study reveals a novel CACNA1C mutation underlying the unique ER pattern ECGs with SQTS. It also shows the rare trigenic mutations are the pathogenic substrates for the complicated clinical manifestation in HCM patients.",34
"The conventional 2-dimensional (2D) cell culture is an invaluable tool in, amongst others, cell biology and experimental pharmacology. However, cells cultured in 2D, on the top of stiff plastic plates lose their phenotypical characteristics and fail in recreating the physiological environment found in vivo. This is a fundamental requirement when the goal of the study is to get a rigorous predictive response of human drug action and safety. Recent approaches in the field of renal cell biology are focused on the generation of 3D cell culture models due to the more bona fide features that they exhibit and the fact that they are more closely related to the observed physiological conditions, and better predict in vivo drug handling. In this review, we describe the currently available 3D in vitro models of the kidney, and some future directions for studying renal drug handling, disease modeling and kidney regeneration.

"Activated B-cells increase T-cell behaviour during autoimmune disease and other infections by means of cytokine production and antigen-presentation. Functional studies in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) indicate that B-cell deficiencies, and a lack of IL10 and IL35 leads to a poor prognosis. We hypothesised that B-cells play a role during tuberculosis. We evaluated B-cell mRNA expression using real-time PCR from healthy community controls, individuals with other lung diseases and newly diagnosed untreated pulmonary TB patients at three different time points (diagnosis, month 2 and 6 of treatment). We show that FASLG, IL5RA, CD38 and IL4 expression was lower in B-cells from TB cases compared to healthy controls. The changes in expression levels of CD38 may be due to a reduced activation of B-cells from TB cases at diagnosis. By month 2 of treatment, there was a significant increase in the expression of APRIL and IL5RA in TB cases. Furthermore, after 6 months of treatment, APRIL, FASLG, IL5RA and CD19 were upregulated in B-cells from TB cases. The increase in the expression of APRIL and CD19 suggests that there may be restored activation of B-cells following anti-TB treatment. The upregulation of FASLG and IL5RA indicates that B-cells expressing regulatory genes may play an important role in the protective immunity against M. tb infection. Our results show that increased activation of B-cells is present following successful TB treatment, and that the expression of FASLG and IL5RA could potentially be utilised as a signature to monitor treatment response.",33
"This paper presents the ""Multi-Role Project"" method (MRP), a broadly applicable project-based learning method, and describes its implementation and evaluation in the context of a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) course. The MRP method is designed around a meta-principle that considers the project learning activity as a role-playing game based on two projects: a learning project and an engineering project. The meta-principle is complemented by five principles that provide a framework to guide the working practices of student teams: distribution of responsibilities; regular interactions and solicitations within the team; anticipation and continuous improvement; positive interdependence and alternating individual/collective work; and open communication and content management. This paper presents the implementation of MRP in a course teaching software engineering, UML language, and project management. The results show that MRP helped the course's students to acquire important professional knowledge and skills, experience near-real-world professional realities, and develop their abilities to work both in teams and autonomously.",123
"Participatory rainwater harvesting for promoting integrated development of agri-horti-livestock-cum-pisciculture was implemented during 2004-2008 at high altitude (>1500m MSL) areas of Mawlangkhar village, West Khasi Hills district, Meghalaya in a watershed approach to assess and refine improved package of practices integrating crops, fruits, vegetables, fish and animal production for higher productivity and income. Soil and water conservation measures like construction and renovation of ponds, jalkund-a micro rainwater harvesting structure on hilltops, bench and half moon terraces were developed with the active participation of the local peoples. The quantum of water harvested at one point of time during monsoon season through two ponds in community lands (2.69 million litre water), two ponds in individual farmer's land (1.2 million litre water) and 15 jalkunds (0.45 million litre) on hill tops estimated to be about 4.3 million litre, was utilized for multiple purposes including irrigation, pisciculture, livestocks and domestic purpose. The cost of water harvesting in community pond was computed at [sic]12/1000 litre (L) and for jalkund [sic] 82/1000 litre considering the lives of pond and jalkund for at least 20 and 3 years, respectively. Impact analysis revealed that the productivity has gone up by 30-40% in potato and 45-50 % in rice with the introduction of improved package of practices for various crops, availability of irrigation water and integration of different components. Farmers are now able to get about [sic]2 440/month from community dairy unit and the individual farmer's income from piggery unit increased substantially which ranged from [sic] 8 465 to 16 654/year. Besides, farmers are earning a substantial income ([sic] 10 000/annum from community pond) from composite pisciculuture. Therefore, integrated watershed programme could be considered as a successful model for high altitude areas of North East India and similar other ecosystems for livelihood improvement of resource poor tribal farmers.",95
"The tumor microenvironment (TME) in the liver plays an important role in primary and metastatic liver tumor formation and tumor growth promotion. Cellular and non-cellular components of the TME significantly influence tumor development, growth, metastatic spread, anti-tumor immunity and response to tumor therapy. The cellular components of the TME in the liver not only consist of infiltrating immune cells, but also of liver-resident cells such as liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) and hepatic stellate cells (HSC), which promote tumor growth by negatively regulating tumor-associated immune responses. In this review, we characterize cells of the TME with pro-and anti-tumor function in primary and metastatic liver tumors. Furthermore, we summarize mechanisms that permit growth of hepatic tumors despite the occurrence of spontaneous anti-tumor immune responses and how novel therapeutic approaches targeting the TME could unleash tumor-specific immune responses to improve survival of liver cancer patients.

"Background: Support for self-management (SSM) is a prominent strand of health policy internationally, particularly for primary care. It is often discussed and evaluated in terms of patients' knowledge, skills and confidence, health-related behaviours, disease control or risk reduction, and service use and costs. However, these goals are limited, both as guides to professional practice and as indicators of its quality. In order to better understand what it means to support self-management well, we examined health professionals' views of success in their work with people with long-term conditions. This study formed part of a broader project to develop a conceptual account of SSM that can reflect and promote good practice. Methods: Semi-structured individual interviews (n = 26) and subsequent group discussions (n = 5 groups, 30 participants) with diverse health professionals working with people with diabetes and/or Parkinson's disease in NHS services in London, northern England or Scotland. The interviews explored examples of more and less successful work, ways of defining success, and ideas about what facilitates success in practice. Subsequent group discussions considered the practical implications of different accounts of SSM. Interviews and group discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. Results: Participants identified a wide range of interlinked aspects or elements of success relating to: health, wellbeing and quality of life; how well people (can) manage; and professional-patient relationships. They also mentioned a number of considerations that have important implications for assessing the quality of their own performance. These considerations in part reflect variations in what matters and what is realistically achievable for particular people, in particular situations and at particular times, as well as the complexity of questions of attribution. Conclusions: A nuanced assessment of the quality of support for self-management requires attention to the responsiveness of professional practice to a wide, complex range of personal and situational states, as well as actions and interactions over time. A narrow focus on particular indicators can lead to insensitive or even perverse judgements and perhaps counterproductive effects. More open, critical discussions about both success and the assessment of quality are needed to facilitate good professional practice and service improvement initiatives.",19
"From November 2014 to October 2015, the concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), O-3 and NOx were simultaneously monitored by using online instruments at the air monitoring station belonged to Tianjin Environmental Protection Bureau (TEPB). The results indicated that VOCs concentrations were higher in autumn and lower in spring, while O-3 concentrations were higher in summer, and lower in winter. The diurnal variations of VOCs and NOx (NO2 plus NO) showed opposite tendency comparing to that of O-3. The concentrations of alkanes were higher (the average of 18.2 ppbv) than that of aromatics (5.3 ppbv) and alkenes (5.2 ppbv), however, the alkenes and aromatics made larger contributions to ozone because of their high reactivity. Tianjin belonged to the VOC-limited region during most of seasons (except summer) according to the VOC/NOx ratios (the 8:1 threshold). The automobile exhaust, industrial emission, liquefied petroleum gas/natural gas (LPG/NG), combustion, gasoline evaporation, internal combustion engine emission and solvent usage were identified as major sources of VOCs by Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model in Tianjin, and the contributions to VOCs for the entire year were 23.1%, 19.9%, 18.6%, 10.6%, 8.7%, 5.4% and 4.7%, respectively. The conditional probability function (CPF) analysis indicated that the contributing directions of automobile exhaust and industrial emission were mainly affected by source distributions, and that of other sources might be mainly affected by wind direction. The backward trajectory analysis indicated that the trajectory of air mass originated from Mongolia, which reflected the features of large-scale and long-distance air transport, and that of beginning in Jiangsu, Shandong and Tianjin, which showed the features of small-scale and short distance. Tianjin, Beijing, Hebei and Northwest of Shandong were identified as major potential source areas of VOCs by using potential source contribution function (PSCF) and concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) models.

"BackgroundSeveral reports found a relationship between increased serum lead levels and the risk for essential tremor (ET), especially in carriers of the minor allele of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1800435 in the aminolevulinate dehydratase (ALAD) gene, which is involved in the synthesis of haem groups. Our group reported decreased risk for ET in carriers of the minor alleles of the rs2071746 and rs1051308 SNPs in the haem-oxygenases 1 and 2 (HMOX1 and HMOX2), respectively, involved in haem metabolism. We analysed whether ALAD rs1800435 alone and their interactions with the four common SNPs in the HMOX1 and HMOX2 genes are associated with the risk for ET. Materials and methodsWe analysed the genotype and allele variants frequencies of ALAD rs1800435 in 202 patients with familial ET and 218 healthy controls using a TaqMan method. We also analysed the role of the interaction between ALAD rs1800435 and the HMOX1 rs2071746, HMOX1 rs2071747, HMOX2 rs2270363 and HMOX2 rs1051308 with the risk of developing ET. ResultsThe frequencies of genotype and allelic variants of ALAD rs1800435 did not differ significantly between patients with ET and controls, and were not influenced by gender. Subjects carrying the ALAD rs1800435CC genotype (wild-type) and the HMOX2 rs1051308GG genotype or the HMOX2 rs1051308G allele had significantly decreased risk for ET. ConclusionsThese results suggest that the ALAD rs1800435 SNP is not related with the risk for ET, but its interaction with the HMOX2 rs1051308 SNP could be weakly associated with the risk for this disease.",34
"Schizophrenia is considered a disorder of abnormal brain connectivity. Although whole brain maps of averaged bivariate voxel correlations have been successfully applied to study connectivity abnormalities in schizophrenia these maps do not adequately explore the multivariate nature of brain connectivity. Here we adapt a novel method for high-dimensional regression (supervised principal component regression) to estimate brain maps of multivariate non redundant connectivity (NRC) from resting functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data of 116 patients with schizophrenia and 122 matched controls. Disorder related differences in NRC involved caudate hyper-connectivity and hypo-connectivity of several cortical areas such as the dorsal cingulate, the cuneus and the right postcentral cortex. These abnormalities were coupled with abnormalities in the amplitude of signal fluctuations and, to a minor extent, with differences in the dimensionality of connectivity patterns as quantified by the number of supervised principal components. Second level seed correlation analyses linked the observed abnormalities to an additional set of brain regions relevant to schizophrenia such as the thalamus and the temporal cortex. The non redundant connectivity maps proposed here are a new tool that will complement the information provided by other already available voxel based whole brain connectivity measures.",72
"The aim was to evaluate the relationship between maternal corticosteroid use during first trimester of pregnancy and risk of orofacial clefts (OC). The overall findings showed a certain association between maternal corticosteroid use and occurrence of OC, compared with non-users (OR= 1.16 [95% CI: 1.01-1.33]). When study type was considered this association was significant only for case-control studies (OR = 1.22 [95% CI: 1.02-1.47]), and not for cohort studies (OR = 1.09 [95% CI: 0.88-1.34]) when there are many confounders (dose, route of application, disease etc.) and biases (re-call, loss-to followup etc.) that still need to be considered. A subgroup analysis based on the type of OC gave an overall OR of 1.41 (95% CI: 1.14-1.74) in the case-control studies for cleft lip with or without palate (CL/P) and 1.09 (95% CI: 0.80-1.48) for cleft palate only (CPO), when comparing maternal corticosteroid users with non-users. However, for cohort studies, the overall OR for CL/P is 1.06 (95% CI: 0.82-1.37) and 1.20 (95% CI: 0.83-1.75) for CPO. The absolute risk of facial cleft after prenatal exposure to corticosteroids, if any, is small. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",34

"We have demonstrated in previous publications the consistent association of the dilated rectum and overactive bladder in children. The pioneering work on this topic, first published by Sean O'Regan, described an enema regimen ideally suited to resolve megaretcum and voiding compliants in these children. As our experience has grown with this population, we have gained more insight into the function of the dilated rectum, its role in dysfunctional elimination syndrome, and the methods required for its most effective resolution. In this review, we will describe the Modified O'Regan protocol, which we have developed to treat patients resistant to Dr. O'Regan's originally described regimen, and we will introduce the concept of ""rectal failure,"" which we feel fully describes the onset and progression of dysfunctional elimination syndrome.",17
"One of the main complications caused by diabetes mellitus is the development of diabetic foot, which in turn, can lead to ulcerations. Because ulceration risks are linked to an increase in plantar temperatures, recent approaches analyze thermal changes. These approaches try to identify spatial patterns of temperature that could be characteristic of a diabetic group. However, this is a difficult task since thermal patterns have wide variations resulting on complex classification. Moreover, the measurement of contralateral plantar temperatures is important to determine whether there is an abnormal difference but, this only provides information when thermal changes are asymmetric and in absence of ulceration or amputation. Therefore, in this work is proposed a quantitative index for measuring the thermal change in the plantar region of participants diagnosed diabetes mellitus regards to a reliable reference (control) or regards to the contralateral foot (as usual). Also, a classification of the thermal changes based on a quantitative index is proposed. Such classification demonstrate the wide diversity of spatial distributions in the diabetic foot but also demonstrate that'it is possible to identify common characteristics.

"In recent years, the validity of embolism quantification methods has been questioned, especially for long-vesseled plants. Some studies have suggested that cutting xylem while under tension, even under water, might generate artificial cavitation. Accordingly, a rehydration procedure prior to hydraulic measurements has been recommended to avoid this artefact. On the other hand, concerns have been raised that xylem refilling might occur when samples are rehydrated. Here, we explore the potential biases affecting embolism quantification for grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) petioles harvested under tension or after xylem relaxation. We employ direct visualization of embolism through X-ray micro-computed tomography (microCT) to test for the occurrence of fast refilling (artifactually low per cent loss of conductivity (PLC) due to rehydration prior to sample harvest) as well as excision-induced embolism (artifactually high embolism due to air introduction during harvest). Additionally, we compared the response functions of both stomatal regulation and xylem embolism to xylem pressure (I-x). Short-time (20aEuro...min) xylem tension relaxation prior to the hydraulic measurement resulted in a lower degree of embolism than found in samples harvested under native tensions, and yielded xylem vulnerability curves similar to the ones obtained using direct microCT visualization. Much longer periods of hydration (overnight) were required before xylem refilling was observed to occur. In field-grown vines, over 85% of stomatal closure occurred at less negative I-x than that required to induce 12% PLC. Our results demonstrate that relaxation of xylem tension prior to hydraulic measurement allows for the reliable quantification of native embolism in grapevine petioles. Furthermore, we find that stomatal regulation is sufficiently conservative to avoid transpiration-induced cavitation. These results suggest that grapevines have evolved a strategy of cavitation resistance, rather than one of cavitation tolerance (diurnal cycles of embolism and repair).",83
"This paper examines the effect of divorce law reforms on fertility using the history of legislation on divorce across Europe. Because the introduction of more liberal divorce laws permanently reduces the value of marriage relative to divorce, these permanent shocks should also affect the fertility decisions of individuals, to the extent that children are considered marriage-specific capital. Our results suggest that divorce liberalization has a negative and permanent effect on fertility. Divorce reforms have decreased the Total Fertility Rate by about 0.2. The magnitude of the effect is sizable, taking into account that the average Total Fertility Rate declined from 2.84 in 1960 to 1.66 in 2006. These findings are robust to alternative specifications and controls for observed (the liberalization of abortion and the availability of the birth-control pill, among others) and unobserved country-specific factors, as well as time-varying factors at the country level. Supplemental analysis, developed to understand the mechanisms through which divorce law reforms affect fertility, shows that both marital and out-of-wedlock fertility decline, but that the impact on marital fertility varies, depending on whether couples are married prior to or after the divorce law reforms, pointing to a selection effect on the composition of marriages.

"Insulin receptor substrates (IRSs) are well known to play crucial roles in mediating intracellular signals of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs)/insulin. Previously, we showed that IRS-1 forms high molecular mass complexes containing RNAs. To identify RNAs in IRS-1 complexes, we performed ultraviolet (UV) cross-linking and immunoprecipitation analysis using HEK293 cells expressing FLAG IRS-1 and FLAG IRS-2. We detected the radioactive signals in the immunoprecipitates of FLAG IRS-1 proportional to the UV irradiation, but not in the immunoprecipitates of FLAG IRS-2, suggesting the direct contact of RNAs with IRS-1. RNAs cross-linked to IRS-1 were then amplified by RT-PCR, followed by sequence analysis. We isolated sequence tags attributed to 25 messenger RNAs and 8 non-coding RNAs, including small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). We focused on the interaction of IRS-1 with U96A snoRNA (U96A) and its host Rack1 (receptor for activated C kinase 1) pre-mRNA. We confirmed the interaction of IRS-1 with U96A, and with RACK1 pre-mRNA by immunoprecipitation with IRS-1 followed by Northern blotting or RT-PCR analyses. Mature U96A in IRS-1 / mouse embryonic fibroblasts was quantitatively less than WT. We also found that a part of nuclear IRS-1 is localized in the Cajal body, a nuclear subcompartment where snoRNA mature. The unanticipated function of IRS-1 in snoRNA biogenesis highlights the potential of RNA-associated IRS-1 complex to open a new line of investigation to dissect the novel mechanisms regulating IGFs/insulin-mediated biological events.",38
"The aim of this paper is to provide an alternative and more efficient screening test for allergy with respect to traditional UNICAP and prick skin tests, which are commercially available nowadays. The proposed test is aimed at monitoring the interaction of the IgE protein with the allergen in an allergic subject. The idea relies on the fact that the interaction between the IgE and the corresponding allergen happens through binding mechanisms between the IgE and the allergen structure, changing the ionic content of the serum. This latter can be monitored by impedance measurements and confirmed by reactive oxygen species (ROS) evaluation in leukocyte subpopulations. Therefore, in this paper we propose a novel system for the detection of allergies based on impedance measurements and confirmed by ROS measurements. This type of measurement approach has never been presented in the literature for this purpose. A measurement protocol has been developed to guarantee reproducibility and repeatability of the assay. This paper describes both the instrument-specifically designed for impedance evaluation- and the measurement protocols for both methodologies, defining univocally, in this way, the overall measurement technique.",105
"Background African American youth in urban centers often reside in poorly resourced communities and face structural disadvantage, which can result in higher rates of poor behavioral health factors such as mental health problems, juvenile justice system involvement, substance use, risky sex and lower school engagement. While parental monitoring has been shown to be protective with regards to these risk factors, less understood are the effects of parental warmth in conjunction with monitoring. Objective This study examined whether parental monitoring and warmth had a main or mediated relationship to behavioral health factors among low income African American youth. Method African American youth (n = 638) completed self-administered questionnaires on parenting factors (i.e., monitoring and warmth), mental health, juvenile justice system involvement, substance use, school engagement, and sexual risk behaviors. Results Participants reported higher mean parental monitoring versus warmth. Parental monitoring was correlated with lower substance use, delinquency, unsafe sex and higher school engagement. Higher parental warmth in contrast was uniquely correlated with better youth mental health but also higher rates of alcohol, cigarette and marijuana use. Conclusions Monitoring their youth at high levels appears to be a common and effective strategy by parents in poorly resourced communities and was associated with lower behavioral health risks. By contrast, parental warmth had both positive and negative associations with behavioral health, suggesting that more research is needed to clarify the circumstances within which parental warmth may be protective or not.",18
"In this paper, we propose a flexible mixed-integer linear programming formulation of the AC OPF problem for distribution systems, using convexification and linearization techniques. The proposed formulation allows the representation of discrete decisions via integer decision variables, captures the nonlinear behavior of the electrical network via approximations of controllable accuracy, and can be solved to global optimality with commercial optimization solvers. The formulation is based on conventional variables that describe network behavior, which ensures its flexibility and the possibility of application to various distribution system problems, as we indicate with case studies.",50
"Background: Some previous studies have postulated an association between migraine and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). This study evaluated the association of EDS with migraine and headache frequency in a general population, after adjusting for potential confounding variables. Methods: The study was a postal survey of a random age and gender-stratified sample of 40,000 persons aged 20 to 80 years old drawn by the National Population Register in Norway. The questionnaire included questions about migraine, headache, the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) and various comorbidities. EDS was defined as ESS >10. The association of EDS and migraine/headache were analysed by bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Results: A total of 21,177 persons responded to the ESS and were included in the analyses. The odds ratio (OR) for EDS was increased for migraineurs (1.42 (95% CI 1.31-1.54), p < 0.001) compared to non-migraineurs; however, this finding was not significant after adjustment for a number of possible confounders. EDS increased with increasing headache frequency, with an OR of 2.74 (95% CI 2.05-3.65), p179 days per year compared to those without headache in multivariable analysis. Conclusions: In a general population, the odds for EDS increased significantly with the headache frequency, irrespective of migraine status. EDS was not associated with reported migraine in multivariable analysis.",127
"In the video monitoring system, due to the complicated background, environment light changes and restrictions on the performance of the device, resulting the difficulty in target detection algorithm design. While the traditional target detection algorithms typically rely on manual selection features, and hard to get a valid classification from amounts of data. Based on the deep learning algorithm, this paper constructs a convolutional neural network, and using the person, vehicle graphics, which are collected by the bionic eye monitoring system, for training the network. Besides we design a series of experiments for analysis the characteristics of the network, and proved that the training set distribution of samples in each category and the number of training samples in a small case would impact the results of the training of deep learning network. In addition, it shows that the parameters of the model using the fuzzy image for training can get a similar result with fuzzy image and clear image.",35
"Contemporary RDBMS-based systems for visualization of high-volume numerical data have difficulty to cope with the hard latency requirements and high ingestion rates of interactive visualizations. Existing solutions for lowering the volume of large data sets disregard the spatial properties of visualizations, resulting in visualization errors. In this work, we introduce VDDA, a visualization-driven data aggregation that models visual aggregation at the pixel level as data aggregation at the query level. Based on the M4 aggregation for producing pixel-perfect line charts from highly reduced data subsets, we define a complete set of data reduction operators that simulate the overplotting behavior of the most frequently used chart types. Relying only on the relational algebra and the common data aggregation functions, our approach is generic and applicable to any visualization system that consumes data stored in relational databases. We demonstrate our visualization-driven data aggregation using real-world data sets from high-tech manufacturing, stock markets, and sports analytics, reducing data volumes by up to two orders of magnitude, while preserving pixel-perfect visualizations, as producible from the raw data.",112
"Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma on the parotid gland is a relatively rare occurrence among head and neck tumors. The mass of parotid gland lymphoma cannot be distinguished from other benign masses of the parotid gland; therefore, it is important to consider lymphoma in the differential diagnosis when examining parotid swellings and masses. Parotid gland lymphoma is most likely to be B-cell, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of one of three types, which include follicular, marginal zone, and diffuse large B-cell, although other histologic patterns have been described. We present a review of a patient with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who presented to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of Pusan National University Hospital (Yangsan, Korea).",7
"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder with complex genetic underpinnings. This review attempts to assemble the myriad of genomic findings to build a clearer picture of the pathobiology of SLE to serve as a guide for therapeutics. Over 100 genes are now known for SLE, and several more penetrant ones have led to the emergence of more defined lupus phenotypes. Also discussed here are the targeted therapies that have come up on the horizon and the specific biologic mechanisms of more traditional therapies which have only recently been explored. The diagnostic toolbox has been enhanced by the addition of new antibodies, gene expression signatures, and mutation panels. This provides an opportunity to piece together the lupus puzzle and even revisit the clinical classification of SLE.",33
"Specific transcription factors are sufficient to reprogram fully induced pluripotent stem cells or other types of cells. These findings raise the question of whether chemical molecules or proteins can replace transcription factors to alter the defined cell fate. In this study, we treated mouse skin fibroblasts (MSFs) with bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and examined intermediate reprogramming of MSFs into stem-like cells. Putative epidermal stem cells isolated from the ventral skin epidermis of an adult mouse were used to confirm the reprogramming activity of BMP4, which increased the proliferation of these cells. After these cells formed spheroids, they were treated with BMP4 and cultured for 5 days. Following BMP4 treatment, the characteristics of these cells changed, and they expressed Oct-4 and its target transcripts Nanog, Sox2, and alkaline phosphatase. To confirm the stem cell potency of these cells, we induced their differentiation into cardiomyocytes. Stem-like cell-derived cardiomyocytes exhibited mRNA expression of cardiac mesoderm markers such as Nk2 transcription factor-related locus 5 and connexin 40, and the cardiomyocyte marker troponin T. These differentiated cells exhibited contracting masses. These results suggest that BMP4-mediated somatic stem cell reprogramming may become an alternative approach for cell therapy.",111
"The ability to timely process significant amounts of continuously updated spatial data is mandatory for an increasing number of applications. Parallelism enables such applications to face this data-intensive challenge and allows the devised systems to feature low latency and high scalability. In this paper, we focus on a specific data-intensive problem concerning the repeated processing of huge amounts of range queries over massive sets of moving objects, where the spatial extent of queries and objects is continuously modified over time. To tackle this problem and significantly accelerate query processing, we devise a hybrid CPU/GPU pipeline that compresses data output and saves query processing work. The devised system relies on an ad-hoc spatial index leading to a problem decomposition that results in a set of independent data-parallel tasks. The index is based on a point-region quadtree space decomposition and allows to tackle effectively a broad range of spatial object distributions, even those very skewed. Also, to deal with the architectural peculiarities and limitations of the GPUs, we adopt non-trivial GPU data structures that avoid the need of locked memory accesses while favouring coalesced memory accesses, thus enhancing the overall memory throughput. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that exploits GPUs to efficiently solve repeated range queries over massive sets of continuously moving objects, possibly characterized by highly skewed spatial distributions. In comparison with state-of-the-art CPU-based implementations, our method highlights significant speedups in the order of 10 - 20x, depending on the dataset.

"In the present study, we address the development and application of an efficient tool for conversion of results obtained by an integrated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and computational reaction dynamics (CRD) approach and their visualization in the Google Earth. We focus on results typical for environmental fluid mechanics studies at a city scale that include characteristic wind flow patterns and dispersion of reactive scalars. This is achieved by developing a code based on the Java language, which converts the typical four-dimensional structure (spatial and temporal dependency) of data results in the Keyhole Markup Language (KML) format. The visualization techniques most often used are revisited and implemented into the conversion tool. The potential of the tool is demonstrated in a case study of smog formation due to an intense traffic emission in Rotterdam (The Netherlands). It is shown that the Google Earth can provide a computationally efficient and user-friendly means of data representation. This feature can be very useful for visualization of pollution at street levels, which is of great importance for the city residents. Various meteorological and traffic emissions can be easily visualized and analyzed, providing a powerful, user-friendly tool for traffic regulations and urban climate adaptations.",86
"Background: The prevalence of musculoskeletal injuries among nursing staff has been high due to patient handling and movement. Internationally, healthcare organizations are integrating technological equipment into patient handling and movement to improve safety. Although evidence shows that safe patient handling programs reduce work-related musculoskeletal injuries in nursing staff, it is not clear how safe these new programs are for patients. Objectives: The objective of this study was to explore adverse patient events associated with safe patient handling programs and preventive approaches in US Veterans Affairs medical centers. Methods: The study surveyed a convenience sample of safe patient handling program managers from 51 US Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers to collect data on skin-related and fall-related adverse patient events. Results: Both skin- and fall-related adverse patient events associated with safe patient handling occurred at VA Medical centers. Skin-related events included abrasions, contusions, pressure ulcers and lacerations. Fall-related events included sprains and strains, fractures, concussions and bleeding. Program managers described contextual factors in these adverse events and ways of preventing the events. Conclusions: The use of safe patient handling equipment can pose risks for patients. This study found that organizational factors, human factors and technology factors were associated with patient adverse events. The findings have implications for how nursing professionals can implement safe patient handling programs in ways that are safe for both staff and patients. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",28
"We continue to explore the scaling transformation in the reduced action formalism of gravity models. As an extension of our construction, We consider the extended forms of the Smarr relation for various black holes, adopting the cosmological constant as the bulk pressure as in some literatures on black holes. Firstly, by using the quasi-local formalism for charges, we show that, in a general theory of gravity, the volume in the black hole thermodynamics could be defined as the thermodynamic conjugate variable to the bulk pressure in such a way that the first law can be extended consistently. This, so called, thermodynamic volume can be expressed explicitly in terms of the metric and field variables. Then, by using the scaling transformation allowed in the reduced action formulation, we obtain the extended Smarr relation involving the bulk pressure and the thermodynamic volume. In our approach, we do not resort to Euler's homogeneous scaling of charges while incorporating the would-be hairy contribution without any difficulty.",88
"This study focuses on four textile industries (DH-GEDA, NOYA, ALMHADI, and ALSAR) established between 2005 and 2008 in the peri-urban areas of Dukem and Gelan. The objectives of the study were to generate baseline information regarding the concentration levels of selected pollutants and to analyze their effects on biophysical environments. This study also attempts to explore the level of exposure that humans and livestock have to polluted effluents and the effects thereof. The findings of this study are based on data empirically collected from two sources: laboratory analysis of sample effluents from the four selected textile plants and quantitative as well as qualitative socioeconomic data collection. As part of the latter, a household survey and focus group discussions (FGDs) with elderly and other focal persons were employed in the towns of Dukem and Gelan. The results of the study show that large concentrations of biological oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), and pH were found in all the observed textile industries, at levels beyond the permissible discharge limit set by the national Environmental Protection Authority (EPA). Furthermore, sulfide (S-2), R-phosphate (R-PO43), and Zn were found in large concentrations in DH-GEDA and ALMHADI, while high concentrations were also identified in samples taken from ALSAR and ALMHADI. In spite of the clear-cut legal tools, this study shows that the local environment, people, and their livestock are exposed to highly contaminated effluents. We therefore recommend that the respective federal and regional government bodies should reexamine the compliance to and actual implementation of the existing legal procedures and regulations and respond appropriately.",96
This study presents a comprehensive investigation of the aerostatic and buffeting response characteristics of a suspension bridge catwalk. The three-dimensional aerostatic response analysis was carried out taking into account the geometric nonlinearity and nonlinear dependence of wind loads on the angle of attack. The buffeting response analysis was performed in the time domain. The aerostatic and buffeting responses of the catwalk show strong coupling of vertical and lateral vibrations. The lateral displacement is the main component of the wind-induced static and buffeting response of the catwalk.,97
"Construction project management predominantly focuses on meeting technical specifications, schedules and budgets, whereas service quality is commonly neglected. Therefore, managing the process from the end-user's perspective provides considerable potential for improving project success. Customer experience management (CEM) guides service providers to make the service as easy and valuable for the customer as possible. This paper explores the potential of CEM in an office fit-out project in Finland and presents a process model to support future projects. The CEM process was collaboratively designed by a construction management consultant and a Finnish governmental property owner. The work involved a series of workshops, interviews and a pilot project. The results show that CEM requires multi-functional collaboration, new management practices and a cultural shift in construction management. In future projects, the created process model may significantly ease the efforts required to plan end-user experience management. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",102
"Introduction: Approximately 80% of patients with hemophilia who received nonheated coagulation factor concentrates in the early 1980s were infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), and approximately 40% of them were infected with HIV. Aim: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of administering ledipasvir (LDV)/sofosbuvir (SOF) to Japanese patients with hemophilia. Methods: Forty-three patients with hemophilia with genotype 1 or 4 HCV were treated with LDV/SOF for 12 weeks. The efficacy, safety, and results of the laboratory tests were evaluated. Results: Twenty patients were coinfected with HIV and HCV. The sustained virological response (SVR) at 12 weeks after therapy was 90% in HIV-positive patients and 100% in HIV-negative patients. The efficacy of LDV/SOF was not significantly different between HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients (P = 0.12). However, the rate of SVR at 12 weeks after therapy in the patients with cirrhosis was significantly lower than that in patients without cirrhosis (P = 0.005). Overall, 20 patients (46%) had adverse events, and while the severity of most was mild to moderate, 3 were serious, including 1 death in the HIV-positive group. All patients completed treatment with no alterations in the antiretroviral regimen. No significant abnormalities in the renal function were detected in patients taking an antiretroviral regimen of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Conclusions: In this cohort study, LDV/SOF was effective and safe, but the SVR in patients with cirrhosis was lower than that in the noncirrhosis group. Thus, patients with hemophilia with genotype 1/4 HCV should be treated as early as possible before the onset of cirrhosis.",130
"I integrate economic, behavioral, and social support perspectives to provide a theoretical account of the HIV/AIDS experience in India. Given the complex nuances of the current appearance of the infection in the nation, no one particular theoretical interpretation might suffice to provide a holistic comprehension of the AIDS situation in the nation. The conflict perspective highlights class effects and poverty in explaining the spread of the infection. The behavioral framework, although allied to the Marxian postulate, moves beyond economic determinism and explains the spread of the infection among other marginal social groups (India's hijra population or men who have sex with men). The social support model outlines social attitudes towards the marginalized which impedes with health intervention, risk assessment or disclosure of health status. Each theoretical tradition provides a cognitive link and is intertwined. In speculating how agency can emerge in the middle of social obstacles, I will discuss how Marxian notions of class consciousness, Goffman's idea of the stigmatized educating the nonstigmatized and Bourdieu's concept of social capital correspond with the preliminary, coalescence and institutional stages of a collective movement raising consciousness about HIV and AIDS in a developing context.

"Soil moisture distributions with high spatio-temporal resolution are scarce but beneficial for understanding ecohydrological processes and closing the water cycle at the basin scale. Sensor networks are innovative in their ability to capture the spatio-temporal heterogeneity and dynamics of soil moisture; however, they cannot be used to directly derive spatially continuous soil moisture distributions. A Bayesian-based upscaling algorithm that utilizes MODIS-derived apparent thermal inertia is used to map daily soil moisture spatial patterns with a resolution of 1 km in the Babao River Basin, China. The 2-4 cm soil moisture observations from seven automatic meteorological stations located in different elevation zones from 3000 m to 3500 m are employed to validate the mapping algorithm. The correlation coefficient and unbiased root-mean-square error (RMSE) averaged 0.880 and 0.031 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively, which indicate satisfactory estimation accuracy. The 1 km resolution soil moisture products are re-sampled to a resolution of 25 km and then compared to the level 3 Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity Mission (SMOS) soil moisture product. The results show that both products exhibit strong temporal consistency; however, due to complex topography, the SMOS soil moisture is generally lower than that of the upscaling results. Semivariograms and an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis are used to analyze the space-time heterogeneities of soil moisture at the 1 km scale. In the summer, rainfall results in soil moisture with low spatial variability and a complex spatial structure. After the rainy season, the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture is affected by other factors, such as soil texture, evapotranspiration and topography. From the perspective of temporal variation, the upscaled soil moisture shows a well-defined seasonal cycle, which represents the effects of decreased rainfall from August to October. Because more rain falls in the summer due to the mountain microclimate, the oscillation in soil moisture is more pronounced over 20% of the area compared to that in other regions. Based on a validation analysis of the mapping results, the upscaling method is proven feasible, and the upscaled soil moisture can be used to analyze eco-hydrological processes and validate remote sensing products.

"In this paper, a dynamical and adaptive LDPC coding scheme is proposed in order to improve the performance of the cryptographic key distillation protocol of an FSO/CV-QKD system considering the atmospheric turbulence levels that may be present in the classic channel. In this scheme, the Generator and Parity-check matrices of the encoder are modified according to the Rytov variance values estimated in the classical channel in order to improve the final secret key rate of the QKD system. The simulation results show that the final secret key was incremented 87.5 Kbps (from 52.5 Kbps to 140 Kbps) using the adaptive code rate; meaning that the information encrypted and transmitted is increased. In addition, the use of the dynamical encoder avoids the drastically reduction of the final secret key rate when the conditions of the classical channel are considered. Our proposal might be implemented based on the use of high-speed FPGA's and DSP's commercially available.",57
"We describe a measuring transducer of electrical conductivity of liquids, used both under laboratory conditions and also for the study of ocean processes (under natural conditions). The transducer is represented in the form of a separate unit for laboratory investigations, which can be used as part of a deep-water hydraulic probe.

"The conservation of water in agriculture requires an understanding of the mechanisms of plant-water relations. This study aimed to reveal hydraulic regulation strategies of maize (Zea mays L.) for maintaining the plant water balance during drought. The water relations of two maize inbred lines (Tian4 and 478) that differ in their resistance to drought in the field were investigated under well-watered conditions and osmotic stress induced with 10 % PEG 6000. The leaf transpiration rate and leaf water potential of 478 varied diurnally, but remained constant in Tian4, which is more drought resistant. Tian4 plants showed morphological, anatomical and physiological advantages that protected them from foliar water loss. The strategies of leaf hydraulics to regulate leaf water balance during the day and during short-term osmotic stress also differed between Tian4 and 478. The leaf hydraulic conductivity of Tian4 and 478 increased temporarily, but their root hydraulic conductivities were reduced under osmotic stress. However, the root hydraulic conductivity of Tian4 subsequently recovered. Lower and rapidly reduced leaf transpiration and the ability of root hydraulics to recover from short-term osmotic stress can help explain the strategies for plant water balance of drought-tolerant maize.",83
"Over-activation of osteoclasts is directly responsible for pathological bone loss in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and cancer metastasis to bone. Hypoxia is a common feature of these conditions, associated with poor prognosis, which also stimulates osteoclast-mediated bone resorption via induction of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1 alpha. Here, we investigate the effects of fibroblast growth factor 11 (FGF11) on osteoclast function. FGF11 is an intracellular FGF that was induced both by hypoxia (2% O-2, p < 0.01) and by inhibition of the HIF-regulating prolyl hydroxylase enzymes (CoCl2, p < 0.001) in osteoclasts. Isoform-specific siRNA demonstrated that the induction of Fgf11 mRNA expression by hypoxia is HIF-1 alpha-dependent (p < 0.01). Hypoxic stimulation of bone resorption was inhibited in osteoclasts treated with siRNA targeting FGF11 (p < 0.05). This was at least partially due to reduced secretion of an unidentified pro-resorptive factor downstream of FGF11. FGF11 expression within hypoxic, resorbing osteoclasts co-localised with microtubule-associated alpha-tubulin. FGF11 was also abundantly expressed in osteoclasts within the rheumatoid synovium and in giant cell tumour of bone. This study suggests FGF11 as a novel factor driving pathological bone resorption in osteolytic disease and as a potential target for the development of new anti-resorptive therapeutic agents.",16
"Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) formed between plant roots and fungi is one of the most widespread symbiotic associations in nature. To understand the molecular mechanisms of AM formation, we profiled 30 symbiosis-related genes expressed in Amorpha fruticosa roots colonized by Glomus mosseae and in non-mycorrhizal roots at different stages using differential-display RT-PCR (DDRT-PCR). The expressed genes were confirmed by reverse Northern blotting. Eleven fragments were sequenced and putatively identified by homologous alignment. Of the eleven AM-related genes, five were obtained at the early-stage of plant-fungus interaction and six at the later stage. Three expressed sequence tag (ESTs) sequences were found to originate from the fungi and eight from the host plant by use of PCR evaluation of gDNA of both plant and fungi. The target genes included an ATP-binding cassette sub-family transporter gene, a transposon-insertion display band, and a photosynthesis-related gene. The results provided information on the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of mycorrhizal symbiosis between woody plants and AM fungi.",38
"Computation is classically studied in terms of automata, formal languages and algorithms; yet, the relation between neural dynamics and symbolic representations and operations is still unclear in traditional eliminative connectionism. Therefore, we suggest a unique perspective on this central issue, to which we would like to refer as transparent connectionism, by proposing accounts of how symbolic computation can be implemented in neural substrates. In this study we first introduce a new model of dynamics on a symbolic space, the versatile shift, showing that it supports the real-time simulation of a range of automata. We then show that the Godelization of versatile shifts defines nonlinear dynamical automata, dynamical systems evolving on a vectorial space. Finally, we present a mapping between nonlinear dynamical automata and recurrent artificial neural networks. The mapping defines an architecture characterized by its granular modularity, where data, symbolic operations and their control are not only distinguishable in activation space, but also spatially localizable in the network itself, while maintaining a distributed encoding of symbolic representations. The resulting networks simulate automata in real-time and are programmed directly, in the absence of network training. To discuss the unique characteristics of the architecture and their consequences, we present two examples: (i) the design of a Central Pattern Generator from a finite-state locomotive controller, and (ii) the creation of a network simulating a system of interactive automata that supports the parsing of garden-path sentences as investigated in psycholinguistics experiments.

"Heterogeneous computing, combining devices with different architectures such as CPUs and GPUs, is rising in popularity and promises increased performance combined with reduced energy consumption. OpenCL has been proposed as a standard for programming such systems and offers functional portability. However, it suffers from poor performance portability, because applications must be retuned for every new device. In this paper, we use machine learning-based auto-tuning to address this problem. Benchmarks are run on a random subset of the tuning parameter spaces, and the results are used to build a machine learning-based performance model. The model can then be used to find interesting subspaces for further search. We evaluate our method using five image processing benchmarks, with tuning parameter space sizes up to 2.3 M, using different input sizes, on several devices, including an Intel i7 4771 (Haswell) CPU, an Nvidia Tesla K40 GPU, and an AMD Radeon HD 7970 GPU. We compare different machine learning algorithms for the performance model. Our model achieves a mean relative error as low as 3.8% and is able to find solutions on average only 0.29% slower than the best configuration in some cases, evaluating less than 1.1% of the search space. The source code of our framework is available at https://github.com/acelster/ML-autotuning.",1
"The argument we make here is a straightforward one: constant news-media coverage of the excessive lifestyles and consumption patterns of the so called super-rich normalize their extreme privilege, while obfuscating the privilege of many others. We examine a series of typical news stories (print and broadcast) together with examples of popular books to show how the mediatization of the super-rich is ambivalently organized through a mixture of celebratory and derisive stances. In tandem with the logics of capital and the tenets of consumer culture, these lurid spectacles fuel a complex mix of anxiety and desire among target readers-viewers, while absolving us from responsibility for our own relatively and seemingly modest excesses. We are invited also to defend ourselves on the grounds of superior judgement and taste.",108
"Background: Mucormycosis is a rare but devastating fungal infection primarily affecting immunocompromised patients such as those with hematological malignancy, bone marrow and solid organ transplantation, and patients with diabetes, and, even more rarely, immunocompetent patients. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence and burden, both clinical and economic, of mucormycosis among hospitalized patients in the U. S. Methods: This is a retrospective study using the Premier Perspective (TM) Comparative Database, with more than 560 participating hospitals covering 104 million patients (January 2005-June 2014). All hospitalizations in the database were evaluated for the presence of mucormycosis using either an ICD-9 code of 117.7 or a positive laboratory result for Mucorales. Hospitalizations were further required to have prescriptions of amphotericin B or posaconazole to be considered as mucormycosis-related hospitalizations. The prevalence of mucormycosis-related hospitalizations among all hospital discharges was estimated. Mortality rate at discharge, length of hospital stay, and readmission rates at 1 and 3 months were evaluated among mucormycosis-related hospitalizations. Cost per hospital stay and average per diem cost (inflated to 2014 USD) were reported. Results: The prevalence of mucormycosis-related hospitalizations was estimated as 0.12 per 10,000 discharges during January 2005-June 2014. It increased to 0.16 per 10,000 discharges if the definition of mucormycosis was relaxed to not require the use of amphotericin B or posaconazole. The median length of stay was 17 days, with 23% dead at discharge; readmission rates were high, with 30 and 37% of patients readmitted within one and three months of discharge, respectively. The average cost per hospital stay was $112,419, and the average per diem cost was $4,096. Conclusions: The study provides a recent estimate of the prevalence and burden of mucormycosis among hospitalized patients. The high clinical and economic burden associated with mucormycosis highlights the importance of establishing active surveillance and optimizing prophylactic and active treatment in susceptible patients.",126
"Background: MiR-101-3p can promote apoptosis and inhibit proliferation, invasion, and metastasis in breast cancer (BC) cells. However, its mechanisms in BC are not fully understood. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of the target genes, pathways, and networks of miR-101-3p in BC is necessary. Material/Methods: The miR-101 profiles for 781 patients with BC from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analyzed. Gene expression profiling of GSE31397 with miR-101-3p transfected MCF-7 cells and scramble control cells was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. The potential genes targeted by miR-101-3p were also predicted. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway and network analyses were constructed for the DEGs and predicted genes. Results: In the TCGA data, a low level of miR-101-2 expression might represent a diagnostic (AUC: 0.63) marker, and the miR-101-1 was a prognostic (HR=1.79) marker. MiR-101-1 was linked to the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and miR-101-2 was associated with the tumor (T), lymph node (N), and metastasis (M) stages of BC. Moreover, 427 genes were selected from the 921 DEGs in GEO and the 7924 potential target genes from the prediction databases. These genes were related to transcription, metabolism, biosynthesis, and proliferation. The results were also significantly enriched in the VEGF, mTOR, focal adhesion, Wnt, and chemokine signaling pathways. Conclusions: MiR-101-1 and miR-101-2 may be prospective biomarkers for the prognosis and diagnosis of BC, respectively, and are associated with diverse clinical parameters. The target genes of miR-101-3p regulate the development and progression of BC. These results provide insight into the pathogenic mechanism and potential therapies for BC.",42
"Identification of fungi in dermatological samples using PCR is reliable and provides significantly improved results in comparison with cultures. It is possible to identify the infectious agent when negative results are obtained from cultures. In addition, identification of the infectious agent can be obtained in 1 day. Conventional and real-time PCR methods used for direct fungus identification in collected samples vary by DNA extraction methods, targeted DNA and primers, and the way of analysing the PCR products. The choice of a unique method in a laboratory is complicated because the results expected from skin and hair sample analysis are different from those expected in cases of onychomycosis. In skin and hair samples, one dermatophyte among about a dozen possible species has to be identified. In onychomycosis, the infectious agents are mainly Trichophyton rubrum and, to a lesser extent, Trichophyton interdigitale, but also moulds insensitive to oral treatments used for dermatophytes, which renders fungal identification mandatory. The benefits obtained with the use of PCR methods for routine analysis of dermatological samples have to be put in balance with the relative importance of getting a result in a short time, the price of molecular biology reagents and equipment, and especially the time spent conducting laboratory manipulations.",30
"Aim Our unit has recently shown that sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) has a significantly positive short-term effect on selected patients with diarrhoea-predominant or mixed irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of the present prospective study was to evaluate the medium-term efficacy of SNS for IBS to establish whether SNS could have a future role in the treatment of IBS. Method Patients with IBS who had previously been implanted with a permanent neurostimulator as part of a randomized, controlled, crossover study, were assessed for medium-term follow-up. The primary end-point was change in the IBS-specific symptom score (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale-Irritable Bowel Syndrome version questionnaire) from baseline to 3-year follow-up. The secondary end-point was a change in the IBS-specific quality of life score (Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Impact Scale questionnaire) from baseline to 3-year follow-up. Results Of 26 patients, 20 were eligible for 3-year follow- up. The median IBS-specific symptom score was significantly lower at 3-year follow-up (30, range 1371) than at baseline (62, 45-80) (P = 0.0001). The effect was observed in all symptom clusters within the score. Also, the median IBS-specific quality of life score was significantly improved at 3-year follow-up (52, 26-169) compared with baseline (135, 82-180, P = 0.0002). The effect was observed in all domains of the score. As per the protocol, 75% of patients were judged therapeutic successes. Seventy per cent of patients had a more than 50% reduction in daily IBS symptoms. Conclusion At medium-term follow-up, SNS continues to be an effective treatment for highly selected patients with diarrhoea-predominant or mixed IBS.",4
"This paper discusses the findings from a measurement campaign on a rotating wind turbine blade operating in the free atmosphere under realistic conditions. A total of 40 pressure sensors together with an array of 23 usable hot-film sensors (based on constant temperature anemometry) were used to study the behavior of the boundary layer within a specific zone on the suction side of a 30m diameter wind turbine at different operational states. A set of several hundreds of data sequences were recorded. Some of them show that under certain circumstances, the flow may be regarded as not fully turbulent. Accompanying Computational Fluid Mechanics (CFD) simulations suggest the view that a classical transition scenario according to the growth of so-called Tollmien-Schlichting did not apply.

"In this paper, a multi-mode parallel hybrid power-train so called clutchless geared smart transmission (CGST), is proposed and assessed in terms of the fuel economy. The use of a single motor/generator and a planetary gear enables the CGST to provide remarkable flexibility with four operational modes including the parallel hybrid mode. Based on its novel configuration, a fuel consumption model is newly developed and simulated to analyze the fuel economy of the CGST. The performance of the CGST is compared with those of the power-split hybrid system and the conventional manual transmission in city and highway cycles. The CGST shows the best efficiency in highway driving by reducing the unnecessary energy loss from the electric motor. Moreover, thanks to brake-regeneration and efficient engine operation with the specific operational modes, the fuel economy in the city cycle is comparable to that of the power-split hybrid system even though the CGST uses just a single electric motor.",53
"Enzymatic characterization of the four group 3 pyridine nucleotide disulfide oxidoreductase (PNDOR) homologues TK1299, TK0304, TK0828, and TK1481 from Thermococcus kodakarensis was performed, with a focus on their CoA-dependent NAD(P)H: elemental sulfur (S-0) oxidoreductase (NSR) and NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX) activities. TK1299 exhibited NSR activity with a preference for NADPH and showed strict CoA-dependency similar to that of the Pyrococcus furiosus homologue PF1186. During the assays, the non-enzymatic formation of H2S from S-0 and free CoA-SH was observed, and the addition of enzyme and NADPH enhanced H2S evolution. A catalytic cycle of TK1299 was proposed suggesting that CoA-SH acted to solubilize S-0 by forming CoA persulfides, followed by reduction of an enzyme-S-S-CoA intermediate produced after both enzymatic and non-enzymatic evolution of H2S from the CoA persulfide, with NADPH as an electron donor. TK1481 showed NSR activity independently of CoA-SH, implying a direct reaction with S-0. TK1299, TK1481, and TK0304 exhibited high NOX activity, and the NADH-dependent activities were inhibited by the addition of free CoA-SH. Multiple disruptions of the four group 3 PNDOR homologues in T. kodakarensis demonstrated that none of these homologues were essential for S-0-dependent growth. Many disruptants grew better than the parent strain, but a few multiple disruptants showed decreased growth properties after aerobic inoculation into a pyruvate-containing medium without S-0, suggesting the complicated participation of these group 3 PNDORs in sensitivity/resistance to dissolved oxygen when S-0 was absent.",36
"With the help of the Boussinesq perturbation expansion, a new basic equation describing the long, small-amplitude, unidirectional wave motion in shallow water with surface tension is derived to fourth order, namely a higher-order Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. The procedure for deriving this equation assumes that the relation between the small parameter , which measures the ratio of wave amplitude to undisturbed fluid depth, and the small parameter , which measures the square of the ratio of fluid depth to wave length, is taken in the form , where is a small, dimensionless parameter which is the order of the amplitude of the motion. Hirota's bilinear method is used to investigate one- and two-soliton solutions for this new higher-order KdV equation.",24
"Objective: The best material choice for cranioplasty following craniectomy remains a subject to discussion. Complication rates after cranioplasty tend to be high. Computer-assisted 3-dimensional modelling of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) was recently introduced for cranial reconstruction. The aim of this study was to evaluate patient- and surgery-related characteristics and risk factors that predispose patients to cranioplasty complications. Material and methods: This retrospective study included a total of 40 cranial PEEK implants in 38 patients, performed at two reference centers in the Netherlands from 2011 to 2014. Complications were registered and patient- and surgery-related data were carefully analysed. Results: The overall complication rate of PEEK cranioplasty was 28%. Complications included infection (13 %), postoperative haematoma (10 %), cerebrospinal fluid leak (2.5 %) and wound-related problems (2.5 %). All postoperative infections required removal of the implant. Nonetheless removed implants could be successfully re-used after re-sterilization. Conclusion: Although overall complication rates after PEEK cranioplasty remain high, outcomes are satisfactory, as our results compare favourably to recent literature reports on cranial vault reconstruction.

"Like other neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer Disease (AD) has a prominent inflammatory component mediated by brain microglia. Reducing microglial inflammation could potentially halt or at least slow the neurodegenerative process. A major challenge in the development of treatments targeting brain inflammation is the sheer complexity of the molecular mechanisms that determine whether microglia become inflammatory or take on a more neuroprotective phenotype. The process is highly multifactorial, raising the possibility that a multi-target/multi-drug strategy could be more effective than conventional monotherapy. This study takes a computational approach in finding combinations of approved drugs that are potentially more effective than single drugs in reducing microglial inflammation in AD. This novel approach exploits the distinct advantages of two different computer programming languages, one imperative and the other declarative. Existing programs written in both languages implement the same model of microglial behavior, and the input/output relationships of both programs agree with each other and with data on microglia over an extensive test battery. Here the imperative program is used efficiently to screen the model for the most efficacious combinations of 10 drugs, while the declarative program is used to analyze in detail the mechanisms of action of the most efficacious combinations. Of the 1024 possible drug combinations, the simulated screen identifies only 7 that are able to move simulated microglia at least 50% of the way from a neurotoxic to a neuroprotective phenotype. Subsequent analysis shows that of the 7 most efficacious combinations, 2 stand out as superior both in strength and reliability. The model offers many experimentally testable and therapeutically relevant predictions concerning effective drug combinations and their mechanisms of action.",40
"Permutation polynomials over finite fields play important roles in finite fields theory. They also have wide applications in many areas of science and engineering such as coding theory, cryptography, combinatorial design, communication theory and so on. Permutation binomials and permutation trinomials attract people's interest due to their simple algebraic forms and additional extraordinary properties. In this paper, we find a new result about permutation binomials and construct several new classes of permutation trinomials. Some of them are generalizations of known ones.

"Background: Ao-dake-humi is a traditional Japanese bamboo foot stimulator consisting of a half-pipe-shaped step made of bamboo used to stimulate the foot by stepping on it, and is commonly used to promote general health among the elderly in Japan. However, its efficacy has not been reported in the scientific literature. This study was performed to investigate the role of ao-dake-humi focusing on lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), constipation, and hypersensitivity to cold (HC). Methods: Participants with LUTS, constipation, or HC were enrolled in this study. Ao-dake-humi was used twice a day for 28 days. Before and 28 days after starting ao-dake-humi use, international prostate symptom score (IPSS), quality-of-life (QoL) score, and overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS) were measured to evaluate the efficacy of ao-dake-humi on LUTS. To evaluate the objective efficacy of ao-dake-humi on LUTS, a frequency-volume chart (FVC) was plotted in LUTS patients for 3 days. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to evaluate the efficacy of ao-dake-humi on constipation (VAS-constipation) and HC (VAS-HC) in the participants with constipation or HC. Results: A total of 24 participants were enrolled in this study. Twenty-one participants had LUTS, 11 had constipation, and 17 participants had HC. IPSS, especially storage-subscore, QoL score and OABSS, decreased significantly after use of ao-dake-humi. The use of ao-dake-humi increased maximal bladder capacity, resulting in a significant decrease in urinary frequency as determined from the FVC. In accordance with the results of VAS-constipation and VAS-HC, both constipation and HC were significantly relieved after ao-dake-humi use. Conclusion: The results of this prospective pilot study indicated that ao-dake-humi is safe and has therapeutic efficacy in cases of LUTS, constipation and HC. The possibility of using ao-dake-humi as physical neuromodulation therapy was shown in the management of LUTS, constipation and HC.",17
"Current treatment for pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients is often ineffective, with serious side effects. Manipulating the gut microbiota via fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an emerging treatment approach but remains controversial. We aimed to assess the composition of the fecal microbiome through a comparison of pediatric IBD patients to their healthy siblings, evaluating risks and prospects for FMT in this setting. A case-control (sibling) study was conducted analyzing fecal samples of six children with Crohn's disease (CD), six children with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 12 healthy siblings by metagenomic sequencing. In addition, lifetime antibiotic intake was retrospectively determined. Species richness and diversity were significantly reduced in UC patients compared with control [Mann-Whitney U-test false discovery rate (MWU FDR) = 0.011]. In UC, bacteria positively influencing gut homeostasis, e.g., Eubacterium rectale and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, were significantly reduced in abundance (MWU FDR = 0.05). Known pathobionts like Escherichia coli were enriched in UC patients (MWU FDR = 0.084). Moreover, E. coli abundance correlated positively with that of several virulence genes (SCC >0.65, FDR < 0.1). A shift toward antibiotic-resistant taxa in both IBD groups distinguished them from controls [MWU Benjamini-Hochberg-Yekutieli procedure (BY) FDR = 0.062 in UC, MWU BY FDR = 0.019 in CD). The collected results confirm a microbial dysbiosis in pediatric UC, and to a lesser extent in CD patients, replicating associations found previously using different methods. Taken together, these observations suggest microbiotal remodeling therapy from family donors, at least for children with UC, as a viable option.",118
"As scientific applications become more data intensive, finding an efficient scheduling strategy for massive computing on network-based computing systems has drawn increasingly attention. Most existing scheduling models assume that all processors are idle at the beginning of workload assignment. In fact, in the real distributed computing environments, processors may still be occupied with any previous assigned workload when a new load arrives. The time period between busy to idle states of a processor is referred to as its release time. Based on the fact that processors have arbitrary release times, we propose a new divisible-load scheduling model with hybrid time constraints and design an effective global optimization genetic algorithm to solve it. Finally, experiment results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.",2
"Parenting and attachment are critical in the emergence of self-regulation (SR) in preschool. However, most studies use general indexes of parenting quality, failing to explore the unique contributions of sensitivity and home quality to SR. Further, the nature of the interplay between parenting and attachment history is not well understood. Using a sample of 938 children from The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development, a series of structural equation models were fit to determine whether sensitivity and home quality concurrently predicted SR at 54 months, and whether attachment mediated or moderated these pathways. Results suggest that both sensitivity and home quality uniquely predict SR. Further, these early parenting variables were each indirectly associated with SR through children's attachment history. That is, higher levels of sensitivity and home quality predicted secure attachment history, which, along with parenting, predicted more advanced SR skills at 54 months. No moderated pathways emerged, suggesting that attachment history may be best conceptualized as a mediating mechanism.",18
"Objectives/Hypothesis: Predicting the prognosis of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL) remains challenging. This investigation aimed to apply Framingham Risk Scores (FRS) to assess the combination of prognostic factors following ISSHL and investigate the predictive role of FRS in patients with multiple comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Study design: Retrospective study. Methods: Twenty-one patients presenting with unilateral idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss and multiple comorbidities were surveyed. Framingham Risk Score was calculated, and patients were assigned into high-risk (FRS >= 20%) and low-risk (FRS < 20%) groups. Mean pure tone audiometry (PTA) threshold of both groups and hearing outcomes following established criteria were investigated. All patients were treated with the same protocol of oral methylprednisolone. Results: Overall successful recovery rate (complete + marked recovery) was 23.81%. The mean PTA threshold of the low-risk group showed significant improvement (mean PTA +/- standard error, SE: pretreatment, 73.23 +/- 11.80; posttreatment, 54.89 +/- 10.25, P =.002), while the high-risk group did not show significant improvement in mean PTA threshold (mean PTA +/- SE: pretreatment, 71.94 +/- 11.77; posttreatment, 68.89 +/- 12.81, P =.73). Conclusion: Framingham Risk Scores may be useful in predicting outcomes for ISSHL patients with multiple comorbidities.",120
"Objective Compare changes in lipids and lipid-associated cardiovascular (CV) risk markers in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with tocilizumab or adalimumab. Methods Post-hoc analysis was performed in patients with RA who received tocilizumab intravenously every 4weeks or adalimumab subcutaneously every 2weeks for 24weeks in the ADACTA trial. Lipid and lipid-associated CV risk biomarkers, including high-density lipoprotein-associated serum amyloid-A (HDL-SAA), secretory phospholipase A(2) IIA (sPLA(2) IIA) and lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), were measured at baseline and at week 8. Results The study included 162 patients treated with tocilizumab and 162 patients treated with adalimumab; HDL-SAA and sPLA(2) IIA were measured in a subpopulation of 87 and 97 patients, respectively. Greater increases in mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (0.46mmol/L (95% CI 0.30 to 0.62)), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (0.07mmol/L (0.001 to 0.14)), total cholesterol (TC) (0.67mmol/L (0.47 to 0.86)), triglycerides (0.24mmol/L (0.10 to 0.38)) and TC:HDL ratio (0.27 (0.12 to 0.42)) occurred with tocilizumab from baseline to 8weeks. HDL-SAA, sPLA(2) IIA and Lp(a) decreased more with tocilizumab than adalimumab. Median changes from baseline to week 8 were -3.2 and -1.1mg/L (p=0.0077) for HDL-SAA and -4.1 and -1.3ng/mL (p<0.0001) for sPLA(2) IIA; difference in adjusted means was -7.12mg/dL (p<0.0001) for Lp(a). Similar results were observed in efficacy responders and non-responders per American College of Rheumatology and European League against Rheumatism criteria. Conclusion LDL-C and HDL-C increased more with tocilizumab than adalimumab. HDL-SAA, sPLA(2) IIA and Lp(a) decreased more with tocilizumab. Lipid change effects of interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibition, manifest by their net impact on lipids and lipoproteins, are not synonymous; the clinical significance is unclear and requires further study.

"In this paper, maximum sensitivity and internal model control (IMC) based proportional integral-derivative (PID) controllers are designed for unstable first-order plus-dead-time (UFOPDT) processes. The designed controller parameters are functions of the UFOPDT model parameters and the IMC closed loop tuning parameter. The tuning parameter plays a vital role and determines the closed loop performance and robustness of the designed controller. Systematic guidelines are provided for selection of this tuning parameter based on maximum sensitivity. Analytical tuning rules are developed for the controller parameters for different time delay to time constant ratios with desired level of robustness. These controller settings allow the operator to deal with the closed-loop control system performance-robustness trade-off by specifying the robustness level (maximum sensitivity). Simulation studies have been carried out on various UFOPDT processes to explain the advantages of the proposed analysis. (C) 2016 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

"Hartley guinea pigs are widely used animal models of disease, particularly in studies of osteoarthritis. The purpose of this study was to investigate lesions in the costal cartilage from 16 male, 5- to 6-month-old Hartley guinea pigs. Routine histological sections from the costal cartilage and costochondral junction (longitudinal and cross sections) and sternum (for evaluation of bone marrow) were examined. All 16 (100%) animals had histological lesions involving the costal cartilage that included matrix degeneration and mineralization, reduced cellularity, and evidence of chondrocyte necrosis. Of the 16, 4 (25%) of the lesions contained blood vessels and 3 (19%) contained central osseous metaplasia. The cartilage lesions were accompanied by degeneration (sometimes with regeneration and/or fibrosis) in adjacent skeletal muscle in 15 of the 16 (94%) animals. The lesions in the costal cartilage were interpreted as dystrophic mineralization of unknown cause and appear to be incidental findings, although they bear some resemblance to lesions occurring in Tietze's disease in humans. The significance of the lesions in skeletal muscle is unclear. Histological lesions of cartilage matrix degeneration and mineralization in these sites have not, to our knowledge, been reported previously.",15
"The benefits of cooperative learning are known for some time, it is a constructivist approach that makes possible a significant learning for the student. In this way, we use this kind of learning to apply it in workgroups of practices classes. The aim is to improve the academicals results of the engineering students in line of The European Higher Education Area (EHEA) The work is done with the practice groups of the subject called Strength of materials. This subject is taught in the second course of the degrees of Energetic Engineering and the Miner and Energetic Resources Engineering in The University of Vigo. The matter is common for both degrees, this fact make that the groups of students are heterogeneous with different academic profiles. The experience consists to form some different workgroup at the beginning of the semester. These groups work along the course to make the different group activities proposed by the teacher. The differences between them are their composition: some groups are made with students of both degrees while other groups are formed only with members of the same degree; also some groups are made by students against other which are made by the teacher. With two clear objectives, to observe the interaction of students with different academic profiles and the influence between the works of students who decide to work together against other groups which imposes group members.",91
"Fast and accurate estimation of rice yield plays a role in forecasting rice productivity for ensuring regional or national food security. Microwave synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data has been proved to have a great potential for rice monitoring and parameters retrieval. In this study, a rice canopy scattering model (RCSM) was revised and then was applied to simulate the backscatter of rice cahopy. The combination of RCSM and genetic algorithm (GA) was proposed for retrieving two important rice parameters relating to grain yield, ear length and ear number density, from a C-band, dual-polarization (HH and HV) Radarsat-2 SAR data. The stability of retrieved results of GA inversion was also evaluated by changing various parameter configurations. Results show that RCSM can effectively simulate backscattering coefficients of rice canopy at HH and HV mode with an error of <1 dB. Reasonable selection of GA's parameters is essential for stability and efficiency of rice parameter retrieval. Two rice parameters are retrieved by the proposed RCSM-GA technology with better accuracy. The rice ear length are estimated with error of <1.5 cm, and ear number density with error of <23 #/m(2). Rice grain yields are effectively estimated and mapped by the retrieved ear length and number density via a simple yield regression equation. This study further illustrates the capability of C-band Radarsat-2 SAR data on retrieval of rice ear parameters and the practicability of radar remote sensing technology for operational yield estimation.

"Background and Overview. A meeting to explore ways to expand access to oral health care for seniors-possibly by expanding a dental benefit in Medicare-was convened in Arlington, VA, by the Santa Fe Group. Four factors motivated the meeting: - need: older Americans are the fastest growing segment of the population, but Medicare excludes most dental care, and most retirees lack dental insurance; - growth of social capital: groups in and outside dentistry are already working to expand access, and they voiced strong support for collective action; - moral imperative: all agreed that no senior should experience pain, poor diet, and loss of self-esteem because of the inability to pay for oral health care; - improved health and economic savings: private insurers have discovered that significant net savings are achievable in general health costs when dental care is provided to people who have certain systemic diseases. Practical Implications. The model Medicare dental benefit presented generated much discussion. There was agreement that any dental benefit must attract participating dentists. Agreement was also reached on the importance of public demonstration projects to further establish cost savings from dental care for patients with comorbid diseases, the need to collaborate with nondental advocacy and policy groups to establish that overall health benefits for seniors are gained by adding oral health care, and the necessity of oral health literacy campaigns working directly at the community level with the general public and others, including educators and the media, as well as with policy makers and providers from all health fields and at all levels of professional training.",8
"Recovered-memory therapy (RMT) is controversial, largely because the practice is regarded by many memory experts as highly suggestible. However, we know little about how the public regards these practices. A sample of college students (N = 118) was randomly assigned to watch 1 of 4 videotaped enactments of a series of therapy sessions in which the client eventually reported a recovered memory of childhood sexual abuse. The therapy conditions were identical except for the level of suggestiveness employed by the therapist (i.e., control, expectation, guided imagery, hypnosis). The results indicated that participants in the expectation, guided-imagery, and hypnosis groups saw the therapist as significantly more suggestive than those in the control condition. However, participants judged the competency of the therapist and the veracity of the memory reports equally high across all 4 conditions. These findings suggest that the lay public may recognize the suggestive practices of therapists engaged in RMT, but they fail to see their relation to the accuracy of the memories reported by clients, or question the competence of the therapist.",78
"Entomopathogenic fungi infect insects via penetration through the cuticle, which varies remarkably in chemical composition across species and life stages. Fungal infection involves the production of enzymes that hydrolyse cuticular proteins, chitin and lipids. Host specificity is associated with fungus-cuticle interactions related to substrate utilization and resistance to host-specific inhibitors. The soil fungus Conidiobolus coronatus (Constantin) (Entomophthorales: Ancylistaceae) shows virulence against susceptible species. The larvae and pupae of Calliphora vicina (Robineau-Desvoidy) (Diptera: Calliphoridae), Calliphora vomitoria (Linnaeus), Lucilia sericata (Meigen) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) and Musca domestica (Linnaeus) (Diptera: Muscidae) are resistant, but adults exposed to C. coronatus quickly perish. Fungus was cultivated for 3 weeks in a minimal medium. Cell-free filtrate, for which activity of elastase, N-acetylglucosaminidase, chitobiosidase and lipase was determined, was used for in vitro hydrolysis of the cuticle from larvae, puparia and adults. Amounts of amino acids, N-glucosamine and fatty acids released were measured after 8 h of incubation. The effectiveness of fungal enzymes was correlated with concentrations of compounds detected in the cuticles of tested insects. Positive correlations suggest compounds used by the fungus as nutrients, whereas negative correlations may indicate compounds responsible for insect resistance. Adult deaths result from the ingestion of conidia or fungal excretions.",126
"We present a technique for representing bounded-degree planar graphs in a succinct fashion while permitting I/O-efficient traversal of paths. Using our representation, a graph with N vertices, (In this paper denotes ) each with an associated key of bits, can be stored in bits and traversing a path of length K takes I/Os, where B denotes the disk block size. By applying our construction to the dual of a terrain represented as a triangular irregular network, we can represent the terrain in the above space bounds and support path traversals on the terrain using I/Os, where K is the number of triangles visited by the path. This is useful for answering a number of queries on the terrain, such as reporting terrain profiles, trickle paths, and connected components.",41
"In an urban highway network system such as Tokyo Metropolitan Expressway. to detect conditions of road pavement and expansion Joints is a very important issue. Although accurate surface condition can be captured by using a road profiler system, the operating cost is expensive and development of a simpler and more inexpensive system is really needed to reduce monitoring cost. ""Vehicle Intelligent Monitoring System (VIMS)"" developed for this purpose is described in this paper. An accelerometer and GPS are installed to an ordinary road patrol car. GPS together with a PC computer are used to measure the road surface condition and to identify the location of the vehicle, respectively Dynamic response of the vehicle is used as a measure of the road pavements surface condition as well as the expansion joints. A prototype of VIMS is installed to a motor car and measurement is made at the actual roads. Accuracy of measuring result and effectiveness of this system are demonstrated; the outline of the system and some of the measurement results are reported herein.",93
"BackgroundIn France, the Alzheimer Plan 2008-2012 has enabled the development of units specialized in managing the behavioural and psychological disorders found in cognitive pathologies, with an emphasis on both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. The aim of this study was to analyze the evolution of behavioural symptoms, autonomy, and psychotropic drug prescriptions at a cognitive and behavioural unit in Toulouse, France. MethodsProspective study, with systematic analyze of data for patients hospitalized in a cognitive and behavioral unit. ResultsThis 2-year study included 199 patients. Behavioural symptoms were significantly improved during the follow-up period and remained so after discharge. Autonomy, especially in walking, was not altered. The prescription of psychotropic drugs, such as neuroleptics, was significantly lower at discharge. ConclusionThis study showed the effectiveness of overall care, with an emphasis on pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments, in managing disruptive behavioural symptoms in a specialized unit.",8
"Vortex flowmeter is installed in piping to measure the fluid flow rate. The piping is easily disturbed by strong transient impact in the application fields, such as other components impacting on the pipeline, manual knocking on the pipe, and opening and closing of valves. The strong transient impact will be picked up by the vortex flow sensor, which makes the vortex flowmeter output wrong measurement results. The current commonly used digital signal processing method can do nothing about it. To solve this problem, an experimental setup is built in our laboratory to study the impact interference, and a large number of vortex flow sensor output signals are collected. The characteristics of transient impacts outputted by the vortex sensor are analyzed so as to describe this type of signal quantitatively. The pattern of transient impact is that the signal amplitudes increase suddenly and then attenuate gradually. A segmented Kalman filter based digital signal processing method is proposed according to this pattern. The data segment containing strong transient impact is found first; the transient impact power is reduced by filtering the data segment second; and through spectral analysis of the filtered signal, the maximum peak of the spectrum is extracted as the vortex flow signal finally. The algorithm is implemented in real time by a low-power microcontroller. Both gas and water flow experiments have been conducted to verify the validity and reliability of the antistrong transient impact algorithm.",51
"The protein subunit is the most important basic unit of protein, and its study can unravel the structure and function of seed storage proteins in faba bean. In this study, we identified six specific protein subunits in Faba bean (cv. Qinghai 13) combining liquid chromatography (LC), liquid chromatography-electronic spray ionization mass (LCESI-MS/MS) and bio-information technology. The results suggested a diversity of seed storage proteins in faba bean, and a total of 16 proteins (four GroEL molecular chaperones and 12 plant-specific proteins) were identified from 97-, 96-, 64-, 47-, 42-, and 38-kD-specific protein subunits in faba bean based on the peptide sequence. We also analyzed the composition and abundance of the amino acids, the physicochemical characteristics, secondary structure, three-dimensional structure, transmembrane domain, and possible subcellular localization of these identified proteins in faba bean seed, and finally predicted function and structure. The three-dimensional structures were generated based on homologous modeling, and the protein function was analyzed based on the annotation from the non-redundant protein database (NR database, NCBI) and function analysis of optimal modeling. The objective of this study was to identify the seed storage proteins in faba bean and confirm the structure and function of these proteins. Our results can be useful for the study of protein nutrition and achieve breeding goals for optimal protein quality in faba bean.",42
"Since 2001, the European Space Agency has investigated a file-based system for providing satellite radio to the automotive market. This system is significantly different from existing commercial counterparts, Such as the American systems XM-radio and Sirius. In terms of service it not only provides traditional radio services but is also capable of offering Multimedia content and data transfer. In terms of infrastructure, it does not require launch of new satellites or deployment of terrestrial repeaters. As Such it offers a highly efficient, low-investment and low-risk approach to offering satellite radio services to a Consumer automotive market. Moreover, it departs from the traditional schedule-based streaming radio concept to a concept in line with the concurrent developments within the media landscape, providing the user the full control of what entertainment to play and when to play it. This paper presents the system in more detail, outlines its performance and makes comparisons with other existing satellite radio systems. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",54
"A regional-level and dimensionless analysis for designing a domestic rainwater harvesting system (DRWHS) was developed. To consider various combinations of water demand, storage capacity, effective roof area, and rainfall in DRWHS design, two dimensionless ratios were used, namely, demand fraction and storage fraction, along with a relationship between the two ratios. Firstly, Northern Taiwan was divided into four sub-regions through cluster analysis based on the average annual 10-day rainfall distribution at rainfall stations and administrative districts. Easy-to-use dimensionless curves between demand fraction and storage fraction were obtained for five rainwater supply reliabilities of the DRWHS for the four sub-regions. Based on the dimensionless curves, a nomogram was constructed for designing DRWHSs at a rainwater supply reliability of 95% in the sub-region I. Storage capacities determined from the dimensionless curves showed a close fit with those determined from simulated values, but were larger than the values estimated from the method presented in the Green Building Evaluation Manual in most situations. The methodology developed herein can be used effectively for the preliminary design of a DRWHS and for overcoming the difficulties faced in designing a DRWHS without rainfall data and with incomplete rainfall data.",95
"Introduction Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is the commonest menstrual problem during perimenopause. The International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics working group on menstrual disorders has developed classification system (PALM- COEIN) for causes of the AUB in non- gravid women. The present study was conducted with the aim to study the two components of this system in clinical practice in general and to establish a clinico- pathological correlation of AUB with context of PALM component in particular. Materials and Methods Two hundred and thirty- six perimenopausal women (aged 40 years and above till 1 year beyond menopause) admitted with complaints of abnormal uterine bleeding were studied. After thorough history and examination, a clinical diagnosis was made as per PALMCOEIN classification. Relative contribution of various causes of PALM (structural) and COEIN (functional) components was analysed. After all indicated investigations, endometrial sampling and hysterectomy specimen were assessed by histology. A clinicopathological correlation was analysed statistically. Result PALM and COEIN components contributed almost equally for AUB when assessed clinically. On the other hand, the histological examination revealed significantly more cases of PALM (structural or anatomical) component of AUB, i. e. 50.23 versus 63.98 % (p <= 0.05) The difference was mainly attributed to the detection of more cases of AUB- M (malignancy and hyperplasia) in highly significant proportions (p <=.01) and coexistent cases of AUB- A; L. AUB- L was the commonest (41.1 %) aetiology overall. Conclusion The PALM- COEIN classification system should take into account both the clinical and histopathological diagnoses in women having AUB around perimenopause as the two diagnostic modalities are complementary to each other and clinical impression should be placed into proper perspective of this classification in order to optimise outcome.",9
"Physical Education Teacher Education (PETE) students are at considerable risk for non-contact sports injuries of the lower extremities. Multifactorial injury prevention interventions including exercises have been successful in sports populations, but no such study has ever been performed in PETE students. This study investigated the efficacy of a multifactorial injury prevention intervention on injury incidence reduction in PETE students. PETE students in the intervention group (n = 154) and in the control group (n = 189) registered sports injuries prospectively. The intervention lasted one academic year and consisted of an injury awareness programme and preventive strategies, implemented by the PETE sports lecturers. Differences in injury incidence between the intervention and control group were tested by Poisson regression Wald tests. There was a trend towards significantly lower incidence rate (2.18 vs. 2.73; p = 0.061) in the intervention group compared with the control group. Students in the intervention group had significantly less acute, first-time and extracurricular injuries. The largest reduction was observed for injuries during unsupervised practice sessions. A multifactorial injury prevention intervention embedded into a regular PETE programme is a promising and feasible strategy to prevent injuries in PETE students. Further research is needed to investigate whether the results may be generalised to other PETE programmes.",27
"Ozonation of a representative taste and odor compound, 2-Isobutyl-3-methoxy pyrazine (IBMP), in drinking water was systematically investigated in this study. Batch experiments were conducted to evaluate the influencing factors including initial IBMP concentration, O-3 addition rate, initial pH, H2O2 dosage, and different water qualities on the degradation of IBMP in the ozonation process. Results showed that the degradation of IBMP followed pseudo-first order kinetics. The degradation rate constants increased with the increasing O-3 addition rate and initial pH value, whereas it decreased with the increasing initial IBMP concentration. Degradation of IBMP is mainly dominated by direct ozone oxidation at low pH, while the free radical oxidation may become dominant at high pH levels. Moreover, appropriate H2O2 dosage can greatly increase the IBMP degradation rates, but large excess H2O2 would act as an OH center dot scavenger and inhibit the degradation. In addition, lower degradation rate was observed in raw water, compared to that in deionized water. Overall, ozonation can be a promising treatment technology to control IBMP-associated water pollution.",96
"Security is an important aspect of an information system in terms of its confidentiality, integrity and availability. Relational Databases are more and more remotely accessed and shared through the network because of growing economical value of the data in the real world. Cryptography and Watermarking are two kinds of security mechanisms, but cryptography does not provide posteriori protection to the data. Watermarking appears as an interesting security mechanism that can provide copyright protection and ownership verification of the data. Watermarking of relational databases is one of the fastest growing areas of research. This paper proposes a new method for increasing the capacity and privacy of watermarking based on circular histogram modulation by taking the host system as colour image. By increasing the capacity it can be beneficial for secure transmission of huge databases like hospital records through the network.",112
"Magnesium sulphate is a potential treatment for acute severe asthma. However, the mechanisms and dose response relationships are poorly understood. The first objective of this study was to examine whether inhaled magnesium sulphate exerts bronchodilator activity measured as bronchoprotection against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction in conscious guinea-pigs alone and combined with salbutamol. Secondly, we examined whether inhaled magnesium sulphate inhibits airways inflammation and function in models of neutrophilic and eosinophilic lung inflammation induced, respectively, by inhaled lipopolysaccharide or the inhaled antigen, ovalbumin (OVA). Airway function was measured in conscious guinea-pigs as specific airway conductance (sG(aw)) by whole-body plethysmography. Anti-inflammatory activity was measured against lung inflammatory cell influx induced by OVA inhalation in OVA-sensitised animals or by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure of non-sensitised animals. Airway function (sG(aw)) was measured over 24 h after OVA exposure. Airway hyperresponsiveness to inhaled histamine and inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were recorded 24 h after OVA or LPS challenge. Histamine-induced bronchoconstriction was inhibited by inhaled magnesium sulphate or salbutamol alone and in combination, they produced synergistic bronchoprotection. LPS-induced neutrophil influx was inhibited by 6 days pretreatment with magnesium sulphate. Early and late asthmatic responses in OVA sensitised and challenged animals were attenuated by magnesium sulphate. Lung inflammatory cells were increased by OVA, macrophages being significantly reduced by magnesium sulphate. Nebulised magnesium sulphate protects against histamine-induced bronchoconstriction in conscious guinea pigs and exerts anti-inflammatory activity against pulmonary inflammation induced by allergen (OVA) or LPS. These properties of magnesium sulphate explain its beneficial actions in acute asthma.",109
'Automotive Materials' is a core course in the Master of Engineering (International Automotive Engineering) Program. The course content focuses on niche areas in component design including alternative materials. Each topic is presented in relation to a particular application. Formal lectures are combined with materials and manufacturing selection case studies where the properties of materials are discussed in the context of particular applications. The present case study focuses on the materials and process selection for an automotive application in particular vehicle roof-rack. Students working in groups chose different vehicles equipped with different types of roof-racks. The use of a computer based materials and process selection methodology was demonstrated and the experiences of the students were discussed.,89
"Moderate doses of stimulant drugs are known to enhance memory encoding and consolidation, but their effects on memory retrieval have not been explored in depth. In laboratory animals, stimulants seem to improve retrieval of emotional memories, but comparable studies have not been carried out in humans. In the present study, we examined the effects of dextroamphetamine (AMP) on retrieval of emotional and unemotional stimuli in healthy young adults, using doses that enhanced memory formation when administered before encoding in our previous study. During 3 sessions, healthy volunteers (n = 31) received 2 doses of AMP (10 and 20 mg) and placebo in counterbalanced order under double-blind conditions. During each session, they first viewed emotional and unemotional pictures and words in a drug-free state, and then 2 days later their memory was tested, 1 hour after AMP or placebo administration. Dextroamphetamine did not affect the number of emotional or unemotional stimuli remembered, but both doses increased recall intrusions and false recognition. Dextroamphetamine (20 mg) also increased the number of positively rated picture descriptions and words generated during free recall. These data provide the first evidence that therapeutic range doses of stimulant drugs can increase memory retrieval errors. The ability of AMP to positively bias recollection of prior events could contribute to its potential for abuse.",78
"Background: Human metabolism is influenced by dietary factors and lifestyle, environmental, and genetic factors; thus, men who exclude some or all animal products from their diet might have different metabolic profiles than meat eaters. Objective: We aimed to investigate differences in concentrations of 118 circulating metabolites, including acylcarnitines, amino acids, biogenic amines, glycerophospholipids, hexose, and sphingolipids related to lipid, protein, and carbohydrate metabolism between male meat eaters, fish eaters, vegetarians, and vegans from the Oxford arm of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition. Design: In this cross-sectional study, concentrations of metabolites were measured by mass spectrometry in plasma from 379 men categorized according to their diet group. Differences in mean metabolite concentrations across diet groups were tested by using ANOVA, and a false discovery rate-controlling procedure was used to account for multiple testing. Principal component analysis was used to investigate patterns in metabolic profiles. Results: Concentrations of 79% of metabolites differed significantly by diet group. In the vast majority of these cases, vegans had the lowest concentration, whereas meat eaters most often had the highest concentrations of the acylcarnitines, glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids, and fish eaters or vegetarians most often had the highest concentrations of the amino acids and a biogenic amine. A clear separation between patterns in the metabolic profiles of the 4 diet groups was seen, with vegans being noticeably different from the other groups because of lower concentrations of some glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids. Conclusions: Metabolic profiles in plasma could effectively differentiate between men from different habitual diet groups, especially vegan men compared with men who consume animal products. The difference in metabolic profiles was mainly explained by the lower concentrations of glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids in vegans.",32
"The terrestrial dayglow displays prominent emission features from the 0-0 and 1-1 bands of the O-2 Atmospheric band system in the 760-780nm region. We present an analysis of observations in this wavelength region recorded by the Space Shuttle during the Arizona Airglow Experiment. A major conclusion is that the dominant product of O(D-1)+O-2 energy transfer is O-2(b, v=1), a result that corroborates our previous laboratory studies. Moreover, critical to the interpretation of dayglow is the possible interference by N-2 and N-2(+) bands in the 760-780nm region, where the single-most important component is the N-2 1PG 3-1 band that overlaps with the O-2(b-X) 0-0 band. When present, this background must be accounted for to reveal the O-2(b-X) 0-0 and 1-1 bands for altitudes at which the O-2 and N-2/N-2(+) emissions coincide. Finally, we exploit the very different collisional behavior of the two lowest O-2(b) vibrational levels to outline a remote sensing technique that provides information on Atmospheric composition and temperature from space-based observations of the 0-0 and 1-1 O-2 atmospheric bands.",94
"Background: Patients with an impaired renal function show a high incidence of bone and mineral disturbances. These `chronic kidney disease - mineral and bone disorders' (CKD-MBD) range from high turnover osteoporosis to adynamic bone disease. Currently, the histomorphometric analysis of a bone biopsy taken from the iliac crest is viewed as the gold standard for CKD-MBD subtype differentiation. However, the clinical relevance of such a biopsy is questionable since iliac crest fractures are an extremely rare finding. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate if the histomorphometric parameter ` trabecular bone volume (BV/TV)' from the iliac crest is representative for other biopsy locations. We chose two skeletal sites of higher fracture risk for testing, namely, the tibial bone and the lumbar spine, to examine if the current gold standard of bone biopsy is indeed golden. Methods: Bone biopsies were taken from 12 embalmed body donors at the iliac crest, the proximal tibia, and the lumbar vertebral body, respectively. Masson-Goldner stained sections of methyl methacrylate embedded biopsies were used for trabecular bone volume calculation. Furthermore, exemplary mu-computed tomography (XtremeCT) scans with subsequent analysis were performed. Results: Median values of trabecular bone volume were comparable between all body donors with median (interquartile range, IQR) 18.3% (10.9-22.9%) at the iliac crest, 21.5% (9.5-40.1%) at the proximal tibia, and 16.3% (11.4-25.0%) at the lumbar spine. However, single values showed extensive intra-individual variation, which were also confirmed by XtremeCT imaging. Conclusions: Distinct intra-individual heterogeneity of trabecular bone volume elucidate why a bone biopsy from one site does not necessarily predict patient relevant endpoints like hip or spine fractures. Physicians interpreting bone biopsy results should know this limitation of the current gold standard for CKD-MBD diagnostic, especially, when systemic therapeutic decisions should be based on it.",16
"A design methodology for three-stage CMOS OTAs operating in the subthreshold region is presented. The procedure is focused on the development of ultra-low-power amplifiers requiring low silicon area but being able to drive high capacitive loads. Indeed, by following the presented methodology we designed a CMOS OTA in a 0.35-mu m technology that occupies only 4.4 . 10(-3) mm(2), is powered with a 1-V supply, exhibits 120-dB DC gain and is able to drive a capacitive load up to 200 pF. Thanks to proposed methodology, the OTA is able to provide a 20-kHz unity gain bandwidth while consuming 195 nW, even under the high load considered. Moreover, the slew rate enhancer circuit in addition to the class AB output stage allows an average slew rate higher than 5 mV/mu s with the 200 pF load. Comparison with prior art shows an improvement factor in the figures of merit higher than 5.",60
"An ambulatory senior health clinic was developed using the chronic care model (CCM), with emphasis on an interdisciplinary team approach. To determine the effect of this care model approach in a nonprofit healthcare system, an observational, longitudinal panel study of community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries was performed to examine the effect on physical function and health-related quality of life (HRQL). Participants in the study were recruited from a community sample of 6,864 eligible Medicare beneficiaries. Informed consent and baseline data were obtained from 1,709 individuals (recruitment response rate=25%) and complete data across 30 months from 1,307 (completion response rate=76%). Participants receiving care in the CCM-based senior healthcare practice (n=318) were compared with patients of primary care physicians supported by care managers (n=598) and a group without care managers (n=391). Self-reported data were collected over the telephone to measure physical function and HRQL at baseline and 6, 18, and 30 months. A multiple group mixture growth model was used to analyze physical function and HRQL across the 30 months. Physical function and HRQL mean scores decreased across time in all participants and were moderately correlated at each wave (correlation coefficient=0.74-0.79). Two latent growth classes were identified. In class 1, physical function decreased, and HRQL remained stable across time. In class 2, physical function and HRQL decreased in parallel. Ninety-seven percent of intervention group patients were in class 1, and 99% of patients in comparison groups 1 and 2 were in class 2. Despite physical function decline, patients in a senior health clinic care model maintained HRQL over time, whereas patients receiving traditional care had physical function and HRQL decline. An interdisciplinary team CCM approach appears to have a positive effect on HRQL in this population.",25
"This study investigates how managers can enhance the knowledge management (KM) among front line hotel employees at the individual level, by affecting the employee goal orientations through supervisory orientations. This study found significant influence of supervisory orientations on employee goal orientation. The positive effect of employee learning goal orientation on KM is also significant. However the effect of performance goal orientation on KM is insignificant. Results also support the indirect positive effect of the supervisory end result, and capability orientations on KM through the mediation of goal orientation. The main contribution of this study is the identification of indirect effect of supervisory orientation on KM through the mediation of employee goal orientation. This study links three separate concepts which are supervisory orientation, employee goal orientation and KM in a single model, for the very first time. Furthermore, the concept of supervisory orientations has not been discussed in the existing hospitality literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",66
"Background: The evidence on the role of gut microbiota in post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) is convincing. Lactobacillus spp. positively affect IBS symptoms, although the mechanisms through which probiotics exert their beneficial effects are largely unknown. The aim of the study is to evaluate the role of Lactobacillus casei DG (LC-DG) and its postbiotic (PB) in modulating the inflammatory/immune-response in PI-IBS in an ex-vivo organ culture model. Methods: Ex vivo cultures of ileal and colonic mucosa from 10 PI-IBS, diarrhea predominant subtype (D) patients, and 10 healthy controls (HC) were treated with LPS, LC-DG and PB. Interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 mRNA levels were assessed by real-time PCR and Toll like receptor 4 (TLR-4) protein expression by Western blotting. Results: At baseline, IL-1 alpha, IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA levels as well as TLR-4 protein expression were significantly higher while IL-10 mRNA levels were lower in PI-IBS D than in HC in both ileum and colon. LC-DG and PB significantly reduced the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and TLR-4 while increased that of IL-10 after LPS stimulation. The protective effect was more pronounced for PB than LC-DG treatment. Conclusion: LC-DG and its PB attenuate the inflammatory mucosal response in an ex-vivo organ culture model of PI-IBS D.",4
"The aim of this study is to compare the prevalence of cardiovascular (CVD)-related comorbidities in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) or psoriasis (Ps) in UK primary care against matched cohorts. Matched retrospective cohort study used a primary care consultation database. Three cohorts were constructed using all patients with a Read code diagnosis of AS, PsA or Ps between 1999 and 2009; each cohort was then compared in a 1:4 ratio to a matched cohort. The prevalence of CVD-related comorbidities (hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, hyperlipidaemia and diabetes mellitus) were identified by the first consultation of a comorbid Read code, in those with an inflammatory condition of interest. The prevalence of CVD-related comorbidities was compared between each inflammatory cohort and their matched cohort using Fisher's exact test. Ninety-four AS, 106 PsA and 290 Ps patients were identified. Compared with matched cohorts, the most prevalent CVD-related comorbidity in patients with AS was hypertension (35 (37.2 %) vs. 96 matched (25.5 %), p = 0.03); this was also the case for PsA (41 (38.7 %) vs. 114 matched (26.9 %), p = 0.02). No differences were seen in the prevalence of other CVD-related comorbidities in those with AS, PsA or Ps compared to their matched cohorts. Our findings provide UK comparisons of CVD-related comorbidities in patients with AS, PsA and Ps alone; specifically, demonstrating increased prevalence of hypertension in AS and PsA cohorts compared to their matched cohorts. This further supports the argument for more evidence in the need for screening and intervention around CVD comorbidities in inflammatory conditions.",107
"Cities play a prominent role in our economic development as more than 80 % of the gross world product (GWP) comes from cities. Only 600 urban areas with just 20 % of the world population generate 60 % of the GWP. Rapid urbanization, climate change, inadequate maintenance of water and wastewater infrastructures and poor solid waste management may lead to flooding, water scarcity, water pollution, adverse health effects and rehabilitation costs that may overwhelm the resilience of cities. These megatrends pose urgent challenges in cities as the cost of inaction is high. We present an overview about population growth, urbanization, water, waste, climate change, water governance and transitions. Against this background, we discuss the categorization of cities based on our baseline assessments, i.e. our City Blueprint research on 45 municipalities and regions predominantly in Europe. With this bias towards Europe in mind, the challenges can be discussed globally by clustering cities into distinct categories of sustainability and by providing additional data and information from global regions. We distinguish five categories of sustainability: (1) cities lacking basic water services, (2) wasteful cities, (3) water-efficient cities, (4) resource-efficient and adaptive cities and (5) water-wise cities. Many cities in Western Europe belong to categories 3 and 4. Some cities in Eastern Europe and the few cities we have assessed in Latin America, Asia and Africa can be categorized as cities lacking basic water services. Lack of water infrastructures or obsolete infrastructures, solid waste management and climate adaptation are priorities. It is concluded that cities require a long-term framing of their sectoral challenges into a proactive and coherent Urban Agenda to maximize the co-benefits of adaptation and to minimize the cost. Furthermore, regional platforms of cities are needed to enhance city-to-city learning and to improve governance capacities necessary to accelerate effective and efficient transitions towards water-wise cities. These learning alliances are needed as the time window to solve the global water governance crisis is narrow and rapidly closing. The water sector can play an important role but needs to reframe and refocus radically.",96
In this article the authors present theoretical and experimental studies of gas-burning devices with the chordal feed of gas jets. The optimum diameter of the nozzles providing for the necessary range of gas jets for a high-quality mixing of fuel gas and air in the mixing chamber of minimum length is determined by calculation. The analysis of the parameters of the flame indirectly proves the reliability of the calculated data. The chordal flow of the gas jets and optimization of their range will significantly reduce the overall structural dimensions of the gas burner units. Short-flame gas-burning devices formed the basis for the creation of the Autonomous heat gun intended for repair and maintenance of engineering networks. Obtaining of a good heat gun is ensured by the motor fan capable of generating a high-pressure jet without connection to an external electrical network. Using of the autonomous heat gun in the housing and communal services is very promising in comparison with similar devices. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.,50
"Multi-mode mobile equipments requires efficient radio-frequency (RF) filtering solutions to solve interference problems in a UMTS system integrated with a mobile television function. We designed and fabricated a pair of RF filters consisting of a band-pass and a band-stop filter, based on temperature-stable bulk acoustic wave resonator (BAW) technology. Both filters measurably demonstrate low insertion loss (similar to 3dB), high rejections (35 similar to 40dB), and fast roll-off (similar to 10 MHz from pass band to stop band). Furthermore, they achieve a low temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) of -4 ppm/C-o, which is five times lower than a conventional BAW filter. The low TCF is of critical importance, particularly in the sharp skirt region, since trivial frequency changes associated with temperature variation could lead to failure against filter specifications at the skirt corners. The proposed filtering solution can be applied to minimize interference present in similar systems, such as mobile phones integrated with satellite radio or GPS navigation.",54
"Background: Parenteral nutrition (PN) is a life-sustaining therapy in appropriate clinical settings. In the hospital setting, some nondiabetic patients develop hyperglycemia and subsequently require long-term insulin while receiving PN. Whether similar hyperglycemia is seen in the outpatient setting is unclear. Methods: We studied patients enrolled in the Mayo Clinic Home Parenteral Nutrition (HPN) program between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2012. Patients were excluded if they had diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), had previously received HPN, had taken corticosteroids, or were at risk for refeeding syndrome. Results: Of 144 enrolled patients, 93 met inclusion criteria with 39 patients requiring the addition of insulin to HPN. The mean age of the insulin-requiring group (IR) was higher than that of the non-insulin-requiring group (NIR) (60.74 +/- 13.62 years vs 48.97 +/- 17.62 years, P < .001). There were 17 (44%) men in the IR group and 26 (48%) men in the NIR group. Mean blood glucose at baseline before starting the infusion was 131.82 +/- 49.55 mg/dL in IR patients and 106.16 +/- 59.01 mg/dL in NIR patients (P = .03). In the stepwise multivariate analysis for assessing the risk for developing hyperglycemia, HR for age was 1.020 (1.010-1.031), P < .001. Conclusions: Hyperglycemia is a common finding with the use of PN in both the hospital and ambulatory setting in patients without a previous diagnosis of DM2. Age was the most significant predictor of the requirement of insulin in the present study. When hyperglycemia is managed appropriately with insulin therapy, the long-term complications can be minimized.",120
"Literature on the development of the human vagina is abundant; however, contributions concerning the prenatal development of the entire utero-vaginal anlagen (UVA) are rare or carried out in rodents. The primary epithelial characteristics in the adult vagina and uterus are determined during prenatal development and depend on epithelio-mesenchymal stroma interaction; thus an investigation summarizing the spatiotemporal distribution of relevant molecular markers in the entire human UVA will be of current interest. We phenotyped epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics in sagittal sections from 24 female fetuses of 1434weeks of gestation and two female newborns by immunostaining with cytokeratins 8, 13, 14 and 17, p63, bcl-2, bmp4, HOX A13, CD31, VEGF, SMA, Pax2 and vimentin. Epithelial differentiation followed a caudal-to-cranial direction in the UVA. Due to the cytokeratin profile of cytokeratins 8, 13 and 14, the characteristics of the different epithelial zones in the UVA could already be recognized in middle-age fetuses. Vaginal epithelium originated from the urogenital sinus in the lower portion and initiated the transformation of vimentin-positive Mullerian epithelium in the upper vaginal portion. During prenatal development the original squamo-columnar junction was clearly detectable from week 24 onwards and was always found in the cervical canal. Early blc-2 positivity within the surrounding mesenchyme of the entire vagina including the portio region pointed to an organ-specific mesenchymal influence. Prenatal findings in human specimens clearly show that fornix epithelium up to the squamo-columnar junction is of vaginal Mullerian origin, and the cervical epithelium cranial to the squamo-columnar junction is of uterine Mullerian origin and includes cells with enough plasticity to transform into squamous epithelium.",75
"There is a misconception of what programming is at the early stages of learning programming for Computer Science (CS) minors. More researches in this field have revealed that the lack of problem-solving skills, which is considered as one of the prominent shortcomings that novices deal with, is exacerbated by language syntax that the novices employ. A Flowchart-based Intelligent Tutoring System (FITS) is proposed in this research aimed at introducing the early stages of learning programming (CS1) to put the record straight. The students who have no prior knowledge of programming are the target audience of this research. In order to support novice programmers in beginning of programming, Bayesian network approach is applied mainly for decision making and to handle uncertainties in knowledge level of students. How to use Bayesian network to take full advantage of it as an inference engine for providing users with various guidance is described in this paper. Therefore, our proposed system provides users with dynamic guidance such as recommend learning goals, recommend options for flowchart development, and generate appropriate reading sequences. Additionally, our proposed system's architecture and its components are elaborated. Our future work is to evaluate the FITS by conducting an experimental study using novices.",40
"Complications resulting from impaired fracture healing have major clinical implications on fracture management strategies. Novel concepts taken from developmental biology have driven research strategies towards the elaboration of regenerative approaches that can truly harness the complex cellular events involved in tissue formation and repair. Advances in polymer technology and a better understanding of naturally derived scaffolds have given rise to novel biomaterials with an increasing ability to recapitulate native tissue environments. This coupled with advances in the understanding of stem cell biology and technology has opened new avenues for regenerative strategies with true clinical translatability. These advances have provided the impetus to develop alternative approaches to enhance the fracture repair process. We provide an update on these advances, with a focus on the development of novel biomimetic approaches for bone regeneration and their translational potential.",31
"Using a simplified high-frequency small-signal equivalent circuit model for BSIM3 MOSFET, the fully differential two-stage folded-cascode CMOS operational amplifier is analyzed to obtain its small-signal voltage transfer function. As a result, the expressions for dc gain, five zero frequencies, five pole frequencies, unity-gain frequency, and phase margin are derived for op amp design using design equations. Then the analysis result is verified through the comparison with Spice simulations of both a high speed op amp and a low power op amp designed for the 0.13 mu m CMOS process.",60
"AIM To determine the placebo response rate associated with different types of placebo interventions used in psychological intervention studies for irritable bowel syndrome. METHODS Randomized controlled trials comparing psychological interventions (stress management/relaxation therapy (cognitive) behavioral therapy, short-term psychodynamic therapy, and hypnotherapy) for the treatment of adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnosed with the Manning or Rome criteria with an adequate placebo control treatment and reporting data on IBS symptom severity were identified by searching PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases. Full-text articles that were written in English and published between 1966 and February 2016 in peer-reviewed journals were selected for the present review. Placebo interventions were considered to be adequate if the number of sessions and the amount of time spent with the therapist were the same as in the active treatment. The placebo response rate (PRR) was computed for IBS symptom severity (primary outcome measure) as well as for anxiety, depression and quality of life (secondary outcome measures). RESULTS Six studies, with a total of 555 patients met the inclusion criteria. Four studies used an educational intervention, whereas two studies used a form of supportive therapy as the placebo intervention. The PRR for IBS symptom severity ranged from 25% to 59%, with a pooled mean of 41.4%. The relative PRR for the secondary outcome measures ranged from 0% to 267% for anxiety, 6% to 52% for depression 20% to 125% for quality of life. The PRR associated with pharmacological treatments, treatment with dietary bran and complementary medicine ranged from 37.5% to 47%. Contrary to our expectations, the PRR in studies on psychological interventions was comparable to that in studies on pharmacological, dietary and alternative medical interventions. CONCLUSION The PRR is probably determined to a larger extent by patient-related factors, such as expectations and desire for the treatment to be effective, than the content of the placebo intervention.",4
"The anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) process has been recognized as a promising sewage treatment approach. Considering the susceptibility, it is meaningful to study the behaviors of anammox bacteria under the unfavorable conditions. Here, we found that anammox bacteria more probably tended to aggregation by the regulation of c-di-GMP against the unfavorable environmental stresses (low temperature, aerobic condition and low pH). Further using multiple protein sequence alignment, we systematically examined the functionality of thirteen genes encoding putative c-di-GMP metabolic enzymes in anammox organism Candidatus Jettenia caeni, revealing most of the predicted enzymes were predicted to be active. Particularly, ectopic expression of jcaA, a gene encoding a protein with both GGDEF domain and EAL domain, suggested that it encoded a functional enzyme capable of both synthesizing and degrading c-di-GMP, which was clearly confirmed by in vitro enzymatic assays and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Furthermore, the catalytic mechanism was simulated by the means of three-dimensional homology modeling and molecular docking. The identification of cdi-GMP turnover and its role in granulation for anammox organism provides a new perspective for regulation of its aggregation capability and further promotion of anammox performance in the application of wastewater treatment process.

"Atypical visual perceptual skills are thought to underlie unusual visual attention in autism spectrum disorders. We assessed whether individual differences in visual processing skills scaled with quantitative traits associated with the broader autism phenotype (BAP). Visual perception was assessed using the Figure-ground subtest of the Test of visual perceptual skills-3rd Edition (TVPS). In a large adult cohort (n = 209), TVPS-Figure Ground scores were positively correlated with autistic-like social features as assessed by the Broader autism phenotype questionnaire. This relationship was gender-specific, with males showing a correspondence between visual perceptual skills and autistic-like traits. This work supports the link between atypical visual perception and autism and highlights the importance in characterizing meaningful individual differences in clinically relevant behavioral phenotypes.",113
"Objectives: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has demonstrated efficacy in treating core symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD); however, widespread use of ECT in PD has been limited due to concern over cognitive burden. We investigated the use of a newer ECT technology known to have fewer cognitive side effects (right unilateral [RUL] ultra-brief pulse [UBP]) for the treatment of medically refractory psychiatric dysfunction in PD. Materials and methods: This open-label pilot study included 6 patients who were assessed in the motoric, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric domains prior to and after RUL UBP ECT. Primary endpoints were changes in total score on the HAM-D-17 and GDS-30 rating scales. Results: Patients were found to improve in motoric and psychiatric domains following RUL UBP ECT without cognitive side effects, both immediately following ECT and at 1-month follow- up. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that RUL UBP ECT is safe, feasible, and potentially efficacious in treating multiple domains of PD, including motor and mood, without clear cognitive side effects.",19
"Background: Responding to joint attention (RJA) is reduced in young children with ASD despite being vital to the early development of social communication. For this reason, RJA is a frequent target in early intervention programs. Clinical guidelines suggest that exaggerating facial expressions or gestural pointing may improve RJA in children with autism by clarifying the meaning of the gaze or gesture. In the current study, we investigate the effect of intensity of emotional expression on RJA in preschoolers with ASD. Method: Twenty-five preschoolers with ASD and 21 typically developing peers were administered a specifically designed eye-tracking task in which an actor directs attention to a moving object by looking at it with an expression that was either neutral, mildly surprised or intensely surprised. In a supplementary condition, gestural pointing was accompanied by a neutral gaze shift. Results: Commensurate with previous studies, children with ASD oriented less to the face of the actor and were less responsive to RJA when compared to their typically developing peers. However, children with autism differed in their response to RJA according to the different task conditions. They demonstrated more frequent responses to RJA when the actor's facial expression was either intense or supported by gestural pointing. Conclusions: We report initial evidence for the importance of clarifying content cues in order to help preschoolers with autism adhere to receptive joint attention (RJA) opportunities. Our findings inform knowledge about early treatment and attention to emotional expressions in autism and improve our understanding of how early interventions may work to increase RJA in young children with ASD.

"This research studies the Emptying-box problem with a porous baffle just behind the entrance opening. A theoretical model is extended to include the effect of a porous baffle, and the theoretical model taking account of porosity establishes the connections between two typical unidirectional displacement flow types. The salt-bath technique is employed to conduct the experiments using an acrylic reduced-scale model. Dye attenuation technique is used to analyze the light intensity data derived from the recorded images of experiments. According to the baffle porosity percentage (phi), the experiments are categorized into two series, EM(79%) and EM(60%). Each series respectively includes three different opening area ratios, which are 1, 0.5 and 0.33. Experimental results show that emptying processes for the cases with a baffle of the larger porosity percentage consist of emptying the dense layer and emptying the mixed layer, but there is only one process of emptying the dense layer for the cases with a baffle of the smaller porosity percentage. Experimental results are in reasonable agreement with the extended theoretical model developed in this research. Two extreme cases, those with and without an impenetrable baffle, are included in this paper to represent two typical flow types of the horizontal inflow denoted as EM(H), as that with phi = 0%, and the vertical inflow denoted as EM(V), as that with phi = 100%, i.e. the unidirectional classical displacement flow and the displacement flow with interfacial mixing. As the porosity percentage increases, the emptying time for the dense layer decreases, but the emptying time for the whole box tends to increase. The emptying time for the dense layer decreases, when the total effective opening area or the reduced gravity increases for the cases having the same porosity percentage. The initial interfacial height of the mixed layer increases, as the baffle porosity percentage increases for the cases having the fixed total effective opening area, or the total effective opening area increases for the cases with the same baffle porosity percentage. The initial buoyancy of the mixed layer is dependent on the penetrative entrainment flow rate from the dense layer to the mixed layer and the emptying time for the dense layer. As the total effective opening area or the porosity percentage increases, experimental results show that the initial buoyancy of the mixed layer tends to increase, and the penetrative entrainment flow rate increases as well, but the emptying time for the dense layer decreases.

"Background: Track and field is one of the most popular high school sports among boys and girls, but epidemiological research on the sport and its individual events has been limited. Purpose: To describe injury rates and patterns in boys' and girls' high school track and field. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: A retrospective epidemiological analysis of injury and exposure data from a longitudinal national high school sports injury surveillance system was conducted. Results: From 2008-2009 through 2013-2014, 2485 track and field injuries occurred during 2,962,308 athlete exposures (0.84 injuries per 1000 athlete exposures). Injury rates were higher in competition versus practice for both sexes. Girls had higher injury rates than boys overall (rate ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.27-1.48) and in practice (rate ratio, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.46-1.76), but competition injury rates did not differ. Overuse/chronic injuries accounted for 27.5% and 36.2% of boys' and girls' track and field injuries, respectively. The majority of injuries were to the lower extremity. Sprints, distance running, and jumps accounted for over 65% of all track injuries. Boys sustained a greater proportion of injuries in relay events (injury proportion ratio, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.69-2.36) but fewer in hurdle events (injury proportion ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.23-0.78). Conclusion: Injury rates varied by event, sex, and competition versus practice exposure. To increase effectiveness, targeted strategies for injury prevention should be driven by an understanding of such differences. Because many track and field injuries are overuse/chronic across sexes and for both competitions and practices, coaches and athletic trainers should be adept at recognizing early injury symptoms, intervene to treat minor injuries in order to prevent severe injuries, and ensure the prompt diagnosis and management of all injuries.",27
"This paper investigates feasibility of developing a predictive rating method to optimize line rating of underground transmission lines based on weather forecast information. Transmission lines, overhead or underground, are essential and indispensable parts of the electric grid which basically transfer energy from the production point to where it is needed. Line rating defined as line's maximum capacity to transfer electric current and power safely and reliably under certain constraints and criteria. To ensure safe operation, rating has been classically calculated according to the worst case scenario, where conductor's temperature rise would remain within specified limit under most unfavorable conditions. Obviously, such an approach leads to very conservative results, leaving line mostly underutilized throughout its life span. In order to optimize line utilization, ambient adjusted rating and more recently dynamic line rating methods are developed. For instance, in dynamic line rating, real-time data are used to determine instantaneous line rating. We have investigated necessity and possibility of developing a predictive model for underground transmission lines by employing weather forecast information, which would enable line operators or owners to anticipate optimized line ampacity and maximum rating over the next few days. The proposed basic model builds upon the already developed and well-documented analogy between thermal and electrical circuits, yet incorporates a time varying source to account for constantly changing ambient temperature. Deterministic weather forecast information can be collected from Environment Canada.",45
"In architectural project review, the perception of the near surrounding ground is important for the evaluation of the virtual environment (VE). This near surrounding ground is missing when using wall screens. To address this problem we suggest increasing the Vertical Field of View (VFoV). One solution is the use of the rendering approach such as non-planar projection. However, simply increasing the FoV of the rendering leads to much distortion in the VE which is not suitable for architectural project review. We propose a new hybrid projection combining a perspective projection in the center of the screen and a cylindrical-like projection on the top and bottom boarders. By this, we increase VFoV without incurring large deformations to preserve the perception of distances and to allow seeing the surrounding ground. We also report the results of an experiment we conducted to evaluate distance perception with our projection.",79
"Cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) is one of the most common types of vascular malformations of the central nervous system, affecting nearly one in 200 people. CCM lesions are characterized by grossly dilated vascular channels lined by a single layer of endothelium. Genetic linkage analyses have mapped three CCM loci to CCM1. CCM2 and CCM3. All three causative genes have now been identified allowing new insights into CCM pathophysiology. We focused on the CCM2 protein that might take place in blood vessel formation; we report here the expression patterns of CCM2 in prenatal development and adult human neocortex by means of immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. CCM2 was obviously detected in vascular endothelium and neuroglial precursor cells during development and also observed in arterial endothelium, neurons, some of the glial cells in adult neocortex. The expression patterns suggest that it could be one of the arterial markers whether this is a cause or a consequence of an altered vascular identity. CCM2 might play a role during vasculogenesis and angiogenesis during human brain development. Furthermore, with this study, CCM2 have been described for the first time in developing human neocortex.

"In this article, we revisit the problem of supporting two-dimensional range successor queries. We present a data structure with O (n lglg n) words of space and O(lglgn) query time. This improves the work of Nekrich and Navarro (2012) by a factor of lg lgn in query time, or a factor of lg(is an element of) in space cost, where E is an arbitrary positive constant. Our data structure matches the state of the art for two-dimensional range emptiness queries and achieves the optimal query time. This structure has fruitful applications in computational geometry and text indexing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",41
"The discharge of iodine-containing wastewater into environment will lead to the water pollution due to the toxicity and radioactivity of iodine and iodine isotopes. A versatile adsorbent which can effectively adsorb the iodine is in high demanded for this issue. In this work, the hierarchically porous bismuth oxide/layered double hydroxide (Bi2O3/LDHs) composites were prepared based on biological template techniques, and the as-prepared composites show enhanced iodine adsorption capacity compared with LDHs fibers. The Mg Al LDHs fibers with hierarchical architectures are synthesized by directly growth of nanoscaled LDHs platelets on Al2O3 fiber surfaces. The Bi2O3/LDHs composites with sponge-like structures are prepared by desorption of Bi2O3 on the surfaces of LDHs fibers. The iodine adsorption behavior on Bi2O3/LDHs composites was examined in sodium iodine aqueous solutions. The appropriate iodine adsorption was obtained at a neutral pH with maximum adsorption capacity of 101.9 mg/g. The Langmuir model successfully describes the iodine adsorption isotherms, while the pseudo-second-order kinetic model is better at describing the iodine adsorption kinetics onto the Bi2O3/LDHs composites. Since the Bi2O3/LDHs composites show near complete removal of iodine ions, the as-prepared Bi2O3/LDHs composites are expected to have practical applications as iodine adsorbent in wastewater treatment.

"Based on Fredrickson's Broaden-and-Build Theory of Positive Emotion, we explored the role of school affect (i.e., positive affect in school and negative affect in school) in connecting gratitude, prosocial behavior, and school satisfaction among a sample of 324 (176 males) elementary school students in grades 4 to 6 by using structural equation modeling. The participants completed a packet of questionnaires, including the Gratitude Questionnaire (GQ-6), the Elementary School Students' Subjective Well-Being in School Scale (ESSSWBSS), and the Primary School Upper Grade Students' Prosocial Behaviors Questionnaire (PSUGSPBQ). The results showed that elementary school students' (1) positive affect in school and negative affect in school significantly related to school satisfaction; (2) prosocial behavior fully mediated the relation between gratitude and school satisfaction; (3) gratitude related to school satisfaction indirectly through positive affect in school and negative affect in school. As hypothesized, the effect was stronger for positive affect in school. Limitations and practical applications of the study were discussed.",65
"Previous research has demonstrated that athletes displaying dominant nonverbal behavior (NVB) are perceived to possess more favorable performance characteristics and are expected to perform better than athletes showing submissive NVB. In the present study we used point light videos of a baseball pitcher displaying dominant, submissive, and neutral NVBs to show that this effect is mainly driven by the submissive condition. No difference between the neutral and the dominant condition was evident, suggesting that it is more important to avoid displaying submissive NVB instead of showing dominant NVB as neutral NVB already seems to lead to the impression that the athlete can handle the situation. The results show that NVBs expressing dominance and submissiveness are important early cues that affect the impression formation process in sport and the expectancy of success of the athlete observing this NVB. In addition, the results indicate, that further information about the ability level of the athlete might diminish this effect. Performance consequences of the effect of NVB are discussed.",63
"Human pharmaceuticals are commonly detected in the environment. Concern over these compounds in the environment center around the potential for pharmaceuticals to interfere with the endocrine system of aquatic organisms. The main focus of endocrine disruption research has centered on how estrogenic and androgenic compounds interact with-the endocrine system to elicit reproductive effects. Other classes of compounds, such as progestins, have been overlooked. Recently, studies have investigated the potential for synthetic progestins to impair reproduction and growth in aquatic organisms. The present study utilizes the OECD 210 Early-life Stage (ELS) study to investigate the impacts levonorgestrel (LNG), a synthetic progestin, on fathead minnow (FHM) survival and growth. After 28 days post-hatch, survival of larval FHM was impacted at 462 ng/L, while growth was significantly reduced at 86.9 ng/L. Further analysis was conducted by measuring specific endocrine related mRNA transcript profiles in FHM larvae following the 28 day ELS exposure to LNG. Transcripts of 3 beta-HSD, 20 beta-HSD, CYP17, AR, ER alpha, and FSH were significantly down-regulated following 28 d exposure to 16.3 ng/L LNG, while exposure to 86.9 ng/L significantly down-regulated 3 beta-HSD, 20 beta-HSD, CYP19A, and FSH. At 2392 ng/L of LNG, a significant down-regulation occurred with CYP19A and ER beta transcripts, while mPR alpha and mPR beta profiles were significantly induced. No significant changes occurred in 11 beta-HSD, CYP11A, StAR, LH beta, and VTG mRNA expression following LNG exposure. An ex vivo steroidogenesis assay was conducted with sexually mature female FHM following a 7 day exposure 100 ng/L LNG with significant reductions observed in pregnenolone, 17 alpha,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20-DHP), testosterone, and 11-ketotestosterone. Together these data suggest LNG can negatively impact FHM larval survival and growth, with significant alterations in endocrine related responses. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",124
"Background: A debate concerns whether eating disorders are increasing in prevalence. The role of socio-economic status (SES) for adolescent eating disorders (ED) is another matter of debate.Aims: To ascertain whether self-reported eating disorders or their symptoms have increased in prevalence in adolescent population from the early 2000s to early 2010s.Methods: A person-identifiable classroom survey, Adolescent Mental Health Cohort study, was carried out among the 9th graders in comprehensive schools in Tampere, Finland, during academic year 2002-2003, and replicated among then 9th graders during academic years 2012-2013. Eating disorders were elicited with questionnaires tailored according to DSM-IV criteria for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.Results: No changes were observed between 2002-2003 and 2012-2013 in the prevalence of anorexia and bulimia, most of the symptoms of anorexia and bulimia, or the proportion of adolescents having received treatment due to eating disorders among the girls or the boys. Eating disorders, treatment contacts due to eating disorders, and eating disorder symptoms were not systematically associated with either low or high parental socio-economic status.Conclusion: Based on this dataset, eating disorders are not increasing in the adolescent population. Adolescent eating disorders are not associated with socio-economic status of their family.",67

"Borderline personality disorder is a complex disease model as it encompasses a diversity of pathological personality traits and psychopathological symptoms. It is not surprising, therefore, that it is often manifested by personality disorders across all three clusters and accompanied by other mental (Axis I) disorders. This melange makes both psychological treatment and pharmacotherapy especially challenging, and this paper describes the case of a particularly complex case of a 33-year-old Romanian patient, who has a history of severe deprivation in childhood, mood and substance use disorder in association with borderline pathology. In the course of treatment from many sources and interventions, it has become clear that dependence is a key component of the pathology and has been rewarded with a degree of success in management.

"In double-lined tunnels, geotextiles are installed between shotcrete and concrete linings to drain ground water that is in the circumferential boundary of the tunnels. During the concrete lining placement, the geotextile often experiences pressures from young concrete on the curved and rough shotcrete surfaces. The pressures are transferred through a waterproof membrane, and act in the normal direction to the curved shotcrete face. The geotextile flow behavior under these conditions cannot be represented by standard geotextile permeability tests. Instead, it requires specially designed performance tests that consider field conditions. A new device to evaluate the permeability of the geotextile in pressurized curved flow channels is proposed; it adopts a flexible loading system and a curved and rough model plate. Testing of geotextiles used for tunnel drainage systems, using the proposed arrangement, shows that the effects of the tortuousity of the flow in pressurized channels affects significantly the geotextile permeability.",93
"Aims: We examined interaction of sex steroid hormones and obesity with regard to insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) by using nationally representative data from the US. Methods: Data of 1461 men aged >= 20 years who participated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed. Multiplicative interaction was calculated by cross-product interaction terms in multivariable logistic regression models. Additive interaction was assessed by the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI). Results: After adjusting for demographic and lifestyle covariates, the odds of IR were greatest among obese men with low free testosterone and high androstanediol glucuronide. Multiplicative interactions for total testosterone, free testosterone, and free estradiol index (FEI) were statistically significant with central obesity but not with overweight and obesity regarding to T2D (P < 0.05). Significant additive interactions with obesity or central obesity were detected for total testosterone (RERI = 2.75, 95% CI = 0.92,4.59), SHBG (RERI = 5.71, 95% CI = 0.77,10.64), and FEI (RERI = -9.96, 95% CI = -19.18,-0.74) with regard to IR, beta-cell dysfunction, and T2D. Conclusions: Our findings add to the evidence suggesting that low testosterone and high estradiol may be associated greater risks of IR and 120 by interacting with overall and central obesity in adult men.

"Background: Chronic otitis media (COM) is one of the most common childhood diseases. Its pathophysiology is complex and multifactorial. The role of specific mucin glycoprotein subtypes in OM is only recently being elucidated. Objective: To determine the relationship between middle ear fluid mucins and clinical variables of patients needing tympanostomy tubes (TT). Methods: Middle ear effusions (MEE) from children receiving TT were collected over a 2-year period. Western blot characterization of mucins MUC5B and MUC5AC along with chart review of age, gender, effusion viscosity, hearing loss >30 dB, history of allergies, and/or respiratory disease were performed. Results: MEE samples from 58 patients were available for analysis. Overall, MUC5B was significantly more often detected in middle ear fluid relative to MUC5AC (90% vs. 51%, p = 0.005). MUC5B presence was statistically associated with mucoid effusions relative to serous effusions (100% vs. 57%, p = 0.0064), MUC5AC presence was not significantly different in mucoid and serous fluid (55.1% vs. 37.5%, p = 0.447). Patients younger than 48 months were more likely to present with mucoid effusion, compared to those older than 48 months of age (p = 0.038). Finally, patients with effusions positive for MUC5B were younger than those with effusions negative for MUC5B (35.1 vs. 76 months, p = 0.045). No other variables correlated to either effusion viscosity or specific mucin content. Conclusion: Patients younger in age needing TT placement are more likely to present with mucoid effusions, predominantly containing MUC5B mucin. As such, we postulate a distinct pathophysiology for mucoid and serous effusions across ages in children with COM. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",105
"This paper presents a method for solving tower deformation and girder deflection in multi-tower suspension bridges. An equivalent model is proposed to simulate a multi-tower suspension bridge in which the towers and main cables are treated as a series of springs. This model can be used for cases of live load acting on one or more spans, and the simple explicit formulas can be used to resolve deformation of the towers and girders as well as for the increment of horizontal cable force in the loaded span. The superposition principle can be used for live loads acting on more than one main span. This paper also presents a finite element model (FEM) of a multi-span suspension bridge with five towers and six spans to verify the analytical formula. Results calculated with the FEM show good agreement with those of the proposed method. This indicates that the proposed method is effective for the preliminary analysis and design of multi-tower suspension bridges.",97
"Although patients may raise new concerns during any time of the medical visit, the closing phase of the consultation is a critical locus for the negotiation of the topicalization of additional concerns. Using conversation analysis as the primary method of analysis, this study provides an analysis of the structure of consultation ""closings"" in Korean primary-care encounters and the way in which the organization of closings in this context discourages patients' presentation of additional concerns. Data are drawn from 60 videotaped primary-care encounters collected from Korea, between 2007 and 2008. The rare occasions in which last-minute concerns are raised are closely analyzed to reveal that the organization of gaze and body orientation play an important role in foreclosing the presentation of additional concerns. The results contribute to our understanding of closings in the primary-care interview by investigating a non-western setting that includes an investigation of an understudied subject - that of embodied resources - and shows how these closings serve the doctor's purpose of bringing closure in the face of last-minute concerns broached by the patient. The cultural meaning of gaze in the Korean medical care context is also discussed. The findings have implications for research on nonverbal communication, cultural differences, and interactions in medical care. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",64
"Mosquito flight activity has been studied using a variety of different methodologies, and largely concentrates on female mosquito activity as vectors of disease. Video recording using standard commercially available hardware has limited accuracy for the measurement of flight activity due to the lack of depth-perception in two-dimensional images, but multi-camera observation for three dimensional trajectory reconstructions remain challenging and inaccessible to the majority of researchers. Here, in silica simulations were used to quantify the limitations of two-dimensional flight observation. We observed that, under the simulated conditions, two dimensional observation of flight was more than 90% accurate for the determination of population flight speeds and thus that two dimensional imaging can be used to provide accurate estimates of mosquito population flight speeds, and to measure flight activity over long periods of time. We optimized single camera video imaging to study male Aedes albopictus mosquitoes over a 30 h time period, and tested two different multi-object tracking algorithms for their efficiency in flight tracking. A. Albopictus males were observed to be most active at the start of the day period (06h00-08h00) with the longest period of activity in the evening (15h00-18h00) and that a single mosquito will fly more than 600 m over the course of 24 h. No activity was observed during the night period (18h00-06h00). Simplistic tracking methodologies, executable on standard computational hardware, are sufficient to produce reliable data when video imaging is optimized under laboratory conditions. As this methodology does not require overly-expensive equipment, complex calibration of equipment or extensive knowledge of computer programming, the technology should be accessible to the majority of computer-literate researchers.

"Background: Data on psychological harm in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) are scarce. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess anxiety, depression, quality of life, and coping in long-standing MEN2 patients. Patients and Methods: Patients were 43 adults (age >= 18 years) with clinical and genetic diagnosis of MEN2 and long-term follow-up (10.6 +/- 8.2 years; range 1-33 years). This was a cross-sectional study with qualitative and quantitative psychological assessment using semi-directed interviews and HADS, EORTC QLQ C30, and MINI-MAC scales. Adopting clinical criteria from 2015 ATA Guidelines on MEN2, biochemical cure (39%; 16/41), persistence/recurrence (61%; 25/41), and stable chronic disease (22/41) of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) were scored. Pheochromocytoma affected 19 (44%) patients, with previous adrenalectomy in 17 of them. Results: Overall, anxiety (42%; mean score 11 +/- 2.9; range 8-18; anxiety is defined as a score >= 8) and depression (26%; mean score 11 +/- 3.8; range 8-20; depression is defined as a score >= 8) symptoms were frequent. Patients who transmitted RET mutations to a child had higher scores for weakness-discouragement/anxious preoccupation and lower scores for cognitive, emotional, and physical functioning (p < 0.05). Feelings of guilt were present in 35% of patients with mutation-positive children. Lower mean score values for depression and anxiety and higher scores for role, cognitive, and emotional functioning were noticed in 33 patients who were well-informed about their disease (p < 0.05). Fighting spirit was more frequently found in patients with multiple surgical procedures (p = 0.019) and controlled chronic adrenal insufficiency (p = 0.024). Patients with MEN2-elated stress-inducing factors had lower scores for fighting spirit and cognitive functioning and higher scores for insomnia and dyspnea (p < 0.05). Eleven patients required sustained psychotherapeutic treatment. Mean global health status was relatively good in MEN2 cases (68.1 +/- 22.3), and the cured group had higher physical functioning (p = 0.021). Conclusions: Psychological distress is likely chronic in MEN2 patients. This study identified diverse MEN2-related factors (degree of information on disease, mutation-positive children, number of surgeries, comorbidities, stress-inducing factors, and cure) interfering positively or negatively with the results of the psychometrics scales. The active investigation of these factors and the applied psychological assessment protocol are useful to identify MEN2 patients requiring psychological assistance.",108
"Background: Migraine is one of the most severe primary headache disorders. The nature of the headache and the associated symptoms during the attack suggest underlying functional alterations in the brain. In this study, we examined amplitude, the resting state fMRI fluctuation in migraineurs with and without aura (MWA, MWoA respectively) and healthy controls. Methods: Resting state functional MRI images and T1 high-resolution images were acquired from all participants. For data analysis we compared the groups (MWA-Control, MWA-MWoA, MWoA-Control). The resting state networks were identified by MELODIC. The mean time courses of the networks were identified for each participant for all networks. The time-courses were decomposed into five frequency bands by discrete wavelet decomposition. The amplitude of the frequency-specific activity was compared between groups. Furthermore, the preprocessed resting state images were decomposed by wavelet analysis into five specific frequency bands voxel-wise. The voxel-wise amplitudes were compared between groups by non-parametric permutation test. Results: In the MWA-Control comparison the discrete wavelet decomposition found alterations in the lateral visual network. Higher activity was measured in the MWA group in the highest frequency band (0.16-0.08 Hz). In case of the MWA-MWoA comparison all networks showed higher activity in the 0.08-0.04 Hz frequency range in MWA, and the lateral visual network in in higher frequencies. In MWoA-Control comparison only the default mode network revealed decreased activity in MWoA group in the 0. 08-0.04 Hz band. The voxel-wise frequency specific analysis of the amplitudes found higher amplitudes in MWA as compared to MWoA in the in fronto-parietal regions, anterior cingulate cortex and cerebellum. Discussion: The amplitude of the resting state fMRI activity fluctuation is higher in MWA than in MWoA. These results are in concordance with former studies, which found cortical hyperexcitability in MWA.",10
"Sudden changes in loading or configuration of an electrical network causes power swing which may result in an unwanted tripping of the distance relay. Hence, it becomes utmost necessary to rapidly and reliably discriminate between actual fault and power swing conditions in order to prevent instability in power network due to mal operation of distance relay. This paper proposes a novel method for the discrimination between fault and power swing based on rate of change of voltage and reactive power measured at relay location. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by simulating series of power swing conditions in PSCAD/EMTDC(R) software for different disturbances such as change in mechanical power input to synchronous generator, tripping of parallel line due to fault and sudden application of heavy load. It is revealed that the distance relay gives successful tripping in case of different fault conditions and remains inoperative for power swing with the implementation of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, the proposed scheme has ability to distinguish the symmetrical and asymmetrical fault occurrence during power swing condition.",50
"BackgroundThis study addresses children of parents with intellectual disability in Norway. The aim was to examine: (i) the impact of definitions of intellectual disability on prevalence, (ii) whether numbers were increasing, (iii) the prevalence of motherhood and fatherhood and (iv) rates of lost custody. MethodsAnalyses of national registers (n=30834) and mapping in four municipalities (n=85). Results0.19% of all children had parents with recorded intellectual disability, increasing to 0.87% with wider inclusion criteria. The number of children born to parents with intellectual disability has been declining since the mid-1980s. The proportion of mothers with intellectual disability was twice that of fathers. Parental custody was revoked for 30-50% of children, with single mothers being at particular risk. Parents with intellectual disability accounted for 20-25% of all custody cases. ConclusionsThe results show that prevalence depends on the definition of intellectual disability. The decreasing number of children and the need for development of specially adapted family supports are discussed.",18
"A relational web driven database accompanied by a strength modeling tool has been developed to provide a more generic and flexible Information Technology (IT) tool that will enable someone to have fast internet access to strength and other useful properties of a wide range of structural natural or artificial damageable materials. Since many structural plain or composite materials are usually involved in every geotechnical engineering subsurface or surface geostructures (e.g. bolted or shotcreted rock slopes and tunnels, compensation grouting, steel or glass reinforced plastic tendons in soils, retaining walls and wooden piles in contact with soils etc), the following five classes of engineering structural materials are considered: porous and pressure sensitive materials like, (1) rocks and soils, (2) concretes and ceramics as well as (3) woods, and crystalline and ductile materials such as (4) metals or alloys, and amorphous materials like (5) glasses.",91
"Characterization of thermoelectric generators (TEG) is widely discussed and equipment has been built that can perform such analysis. One method is often used to perform such characterization: constant temperature with variable thermal power input. Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) methods for TEG systems are mostly tested under steady-state conditions for different constant input temperatures. However, for most TEG applications, the input temperature gradient changes, exposing the MPPT to variable tracking conditions. An example is the exhaust pipe on hybrid vehicles, for which, because of the intermittent operation of the internal combustion engine, the TEGand its MPPT controller are exposed to a cyclic temperature profile. Furthermore, there are no guidelines on how fast the MPPT must be under such dynamic conditions. In the work discussed in this paper, temperature gradients for TEG integrated in several applications were evaluated; the results showed temperature variation up to 5 degrees C/s for TEG systems. Electrical characterization of a calcium-manganese oxide TEG was performed at steady-state for different input temperatures and a maximum temperature of 401 degrees C. By using electrical data from characterization of the oxide module, a solar array simulator was emulated to performas a TEG. A trapezoidal temperature profile with different gradients was used on the TEG simulator to evaluate the dynamic MPPT efficiency. It is known that the perturb and observe (P&O) algorithm may have difficulty accurately tracking under rapidly changing conditions. To solve this problem, a compromise must be found between the magnitude of the increment and the sampling frequency of the control algorithm. The standard P&O performance was evaluated experimentally by using different temperature gradients for different MPPT sampling frequencies, and efficiency values are provided for all cases. The results showed that a tracking speed of 2.5 Hz can be successfully implemented on a TEG system to provide similar to 95% MPPT efficiency when the input temperature is changing at 5 degrees C/s.",87
"To evaluate the effects of mulching and ridge and furrow widths on soil temperature and moisture, crop growth and yield, and water use efficiency (WUE), a series of field experiments were conducted in a potato field in Inner Mongolia, China. In 2009 and 2010, four treatments (flat plot without mulching (CK), plastic film mulched ridge (MR), MRF (plastic film mulched ridge and furrow (MRF), and non-mulched (NM0.5)) were conducted on the same widths of ridge (0.5 m) and furrow (0.5 m), and two additional non-mulching treatments (1.0 m ridge and furrow width (NM1.0), and 1.5 m ridge and furrow width (NM1.5)) were tested in 2011 and 2012. The results indicated that mulching practices increased topsoil temperature compared to non-mulching treatments at the emergence stage. Compared to CK, the soil water storage in furrows was increased by 10.2 mm on average in 2009 for the MRF treatment, 8.1 mm and 15.1 mm in 2011, and 14.0 mm and 21.2 mm in 2012 for NM1.0 and NM1.5, respectively, and plant leaf area index and dry biomass values during the potato growth stage were also increased. The MR treatment produced greater effects on crop productivity than NM0.5, and increased total yield and marketable yield by 21.4% and 36.3% compared to CK in 2010. Of three non-mulching treatments (i.e., NM0.5, NM1.0, and NM1.5), the NM1.0 treatment produced the highest total yield and marketable yield; compared to CK, the WUE, total yield, and marketable yield were increased by 12.7%, 8.2%, and 52.0% in 2011, and 23.4%, 16.4%, and 81.0% in 2012, respectively.

"From the perspective of science-based innovation, this study introduces measures of both scientific linkage (technology-science correlation index) and technological innovation capabilities (relative growth rate, relative patent position and revealed technological advantage) to compare and analyze the international competitiveness of solar energy technologies among the United States, the European Union, Japan, China and South Korea, based on the solar energy technologies-related patents in the European Patent Office Worldwide Patent Statistical Database. After making international comparisons of their technological development and innovation paradigm, we find that there are different innovation characteristics of various technology fields within the solar energy industry and then propose some relevant policy recommendations for latecomers to implement catch-up strategies. The results show that the leading countries and regions of the solar energy industry such as the United States and the European Union focus mainly on science-based innovation, while Japan and latecomers like China and South Korea pay more attention on technology-based innovation. In addition, those two fields within the solar energy industry present opposite innovation characteristics: solar photovoltaic technologies, especially thin film and organic cells, present strong technological innovation capabilities with high scientific linkage, while solar thermal technologies show strong technological innovation capabilities with low scientific linkage.",100
"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are enzymes that charge specific tRNAs with their cognate amino acids and play an essential role in the initial steps of protein synthesis. Because these enzymes are attractive targets for drug development in many microorganisms, there is a pressing need for assays suitable for compound screening. We developed (1) a high throughput assay for measuring aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activity and (2) an accompanying method for preparing the tRNA substrate. The assay can be performed in 96-well plates and relies on malachite green detection of pyrophosphate (Pi) as an indicator of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activity. Analysis of Trypanosoma brucei isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS) activity showed that the assay exhibits sensitivity to picomoles of product, and yielded a Z' factor of 0.56. We show that this assay is applicable to other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and to enzyme inhibition studies. Using this assay, we found that the compound NSC616354 inhibits recombinant IleRS with an IC50 of 0.6 mu M. Enzymology studies were also performed with rIleRS and its K-m and k(cat) determined as 3.97 x 10(-5) mol/L and 142 S-1, respectively. This assay will facilitate the screening of compounds to identify inhibitors of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.",36
"Community detection is a common problem in various types of complex networks. With the emerging of large scale real networks like social networks, community detection meets new technology challenges of extremely large computational cost and lack of prior information. Although several literatures recently try to solve these new challenges, they still have limitations of parallelism and running time. With the scale of data increases sharply, the parallelism is necessary but few codes exist. In this work, we analyze the process of random walking in graphs, and observe that the weight of an edge gotten by processing the vertices visited by the walker could be an indicator to measure the closeness of vertex connection. Based on this finding, we first propose a novel parallel computing community detection algorithm for big unweighted undirected graphs in the true sense. The algorithm consists of three steps, including random walking using multiple independent random walks, weight calculating for edges and community detecting. The time complexity of our algorithm is O (n log n) without prior information. In order to implement our parallel computing algorithm efficiently, we also propose a novelty graph partition model. Experimental results show that our algorithm is capable of detecting the community structure and the overlapping parts of communities in real-world effectively (reduce the running time by 400 times at least), and handling the challenges of community detection in big graph era.

"Background: All countries face significant challenges from complex manifestations of malnutrition, which affects one in three people globally. Systematic reviews provide ready-to-use syntheses of quality-appraised evidence to inform decision-making for actions. To enhance the utility and quality of future Cochrane nutrition evidence, we described the scope and quality of all nutrition systematic reviews in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR). Methods: We screened all active CDSR records (31 July 2015) to identify reviews and protocols using pre-specified eligibility criteria and definitions. Duplicate, independent data extraction included criteria for inclusion of studies in completed reviews (PICOS). We assessed methodological quality (AMSTAR), use of GRADE, mapped reviews against 2013 Global Burden of Disease data, and categorised the paradigm (medical, lifestyle and socio-ecological) of the review question. We analysed our results using descriptive statistics. Results: We screened 8484 records, and included 470 (8%) completed reviews (in 45 Cochrane Review Groups (CRGs)) and 169 (7%) protocols (in 41 CRGs) published by 47 of 53 CRGs with reviews. Most completed reviews were produced by the Pregnancy and Childbirth (n = 73), Neonatal (n = 64), Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders (n = 33), Developmental, Psychosocial and Learning Problems (n = 26), Kidney and Transplant (n = 18) and Heart (n = 18) CRGs. Only 27% (n = 129) of reviews had searches for new studies in 2013 or thereafter. Supplementation/supplement interventions were most common (50%; n = 235; majority with micronutrients; 73%, n = 173), followed by food interventions (20%; n = 95). All reviews included randomised controlled trials; about 5% included other designs; 25% used GRADE; the median AMSTAR score was 9 (interquartile range: 7 to 10), 51% were high (AMSTAR 9-11) and 49% moderate (AMSTAR 5-8) quality. More than 80% framed questions using a medical paradigm. For top causes of years-of-life-lost, most reviews addressed preterm birth, diabetes and ischaemic heart disease; for leading risk factors for disability-adjusted-life-years, most targeted childhood undernutrition and high body mass index. Conclusions: Nutrition reviews comprised 8% of active CDSR records, were widely distributed across nearly all CRGs and reflected the double nutrition burden. This analysis presents a comprehensive description of the scope and quality of Cochrane nutrition reviews, and identifies gaps for future activities to support actions to address the nutrition burden, in line with the current nutrition agenda and impetus.",129
"The use of analog circuits to reduce the size and power consumption of channel decoders such as Viterbi decoders has been an active area of research over the recent years. However, the need for digital memory to store the history of the path elimination decisions in a Viterbi decoder, limits the potential advantages that could be offered by an all-analog convolutional decoder implementation. This is especially so in cases where the use of an older silicon process technology is dictated by the application; hence, the power-reduction benefits offered by deep sub-micrometer digital designs cannot be exploited. A novel alternative convolutional decoding method which allows for an entirely analog implementation is the modified feedback decoding algorithm (MFDA). This paper describes the first integrated realization of a convolutional decoder employing the MFDA. The rate-1/2, constraint-length-3 decoder, employs a current-mode analog signal processing core and was fabricated in a 0.6-mu m CMOS process technology, occupying an area of 0.5 mm(2). Measured results show that decoding speeds in excess of 1-Mb/s are possible with virtually no loss in coding gain. Total power consumption is 2.45 mW from a single 3-V supply. Although a hard-decision decoder, conversion to soft-decision decoding requires only the inclusion of a simple analog delay line as shown in the paper. The decoder is dedicated to an implantable biotelemetry system, but it can also find use in other low-power applications. System-level coding simulations are also presented which are useful for the construction of larger decoders where the benefits of the MFDA approach would be more pronounced.",52
"Interest on Tau protein is fast increasing in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. There is the urgent need of highly sensitive and specific diagnostic platforms for its quantification, also in combination with the other AD hallmarks. Up to now, SPR has been poorly exploited for tau detection by immunosensing, due to sensitivity limits at nanomolar level, whereas the clinical requirement is in the picomolar range. Molecular architectures built in a layer-by-layer fashion, biomolecules and nanostructures (metallic or not) may amplify the SPR signal and improve the limit of detection to the desired sensitivity. Mostly gold nanostructures are widely employed to this aim, but great interest is also emerging in Multi Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs). Here MWCNTs are modified and then decorated with the secondary antibody for tau protein. Eventually we took advantage from MWCNTs-antibody conjugate to obtain a sandwich-based bioassay with the capability to increase the SPR signal of about 102 folds compared to direct detection and conventional unconjugated sandwich. With respect to these results, we hope to give a strong impulse for further investigation on studying possible roles of carbon nanotubes in optical-based biosensing.",106
"This article provides an overview of the Digital Video Broadcasting - Satellite (DVB-S) specifications and the context of its extension to mobility. Different ways for receiving digital television on mobile devices are summarized. Then, the overall demonstrator from the antenna to the baseband signal processing is presented. Some attention is paid to the analog channel selection and QPSK frequency demodulation. The noise issues are deeply developed in this paper. Finally, a new technique (the ""Wipe-off technique"") for improving noise performances is suggested. It is claimed that DVB-S fulfills the requirements to extend the fixed reception toward mobility in Ku-band with large area coverage, good quality of the received signals, reduced total network cost and low power consumption thanks to a full analog signal processing channel selection.",52
"Neurocysticercosis is the leading cause of parasitosis of the central nervous system and acquired epilepsy in developing countries. The clinical manifestations of neurocysticercosis, especially its racemose variant, are pleomorphic and unspecific, characteristics that hinder the diagnosis and make it a challenge for the clinician. The objective of this report was to describe two cases of racemose neurocysticercosis in which neuroimaging led to the definitive diagnosis. The first case involved a patient with persistent headache and focal neurological signs. She required multiple paraclinical tests that led to the definitive diagnosis of racemose neurocysticercosis with secondary cerebral vasculitis. Despite medical and surgical treatment the patient died after multiple complications. The second case involved a patient with a history of neurocysticercosis, who consulted for chronic intractable vomiting. She required multiple paraclinical tests that led to the diagnosis of vomiting of central origin secondary to racemose neurocysticercosis and entrapment of the fourth ventricle. After medical and surgical treatment the patient showed slight improvement. In these two cases it was evident how proper interpretation of neuroimages is essential for the diagnosis of racemose neurocysticercosis.",127
"Independently adjustable multielectrode arrays are routinely used to interrogate neuronal circuit function, enabling chronic in vivo monitoring of neuronal ensembles in freely behaving animals at a single-cell, single spike resolution. Despite the importance of this approach, its widespread use is limited by highly specialized design and fabrication methods. To address this, we have developed a Scalable, Lightweight, Integrated and Quick-to-assemble multielectrode array platform. This platform additionally integrates optical fibers with independently adjustable electrodes to allow simultaneous single unit recordings and circuit-specific optogenetic targeting and/or manipulation. In current designs, the fully assembled platforms are scalable from 2 to 32 microdrives, and yet range 1-3 g, light enough for small animals. Here, we describe the design process starting from intent in computer-aided design, parameter testing through finite element analysis and experimental means, and implementation of various applications across mice and rats. Combined, our methods may expand the utility of multielectrode recordings and their continued integration with other tools enabling functional dissection of intact neural circuits.",82
"The advent of native mobile technologies particularly advances in the Mobile Operating Systems (OS), popularly among Android, Windows Mobile OS, iOS and their acceptance as an alternative to existing browser based access; has enabled the remote access of equipment and instruments over the World Wide Web (WWW). While more and more remote control solutions have been implemented in the industry via Local Area Networks (LANs), Wide Area Networks (WANs), and the Web, Online Remote Accessible Laboratory (ORAL) has surpassed the simulation as a tool for learning scientific methods with the results and observations being real time rather than ideal and facilitate the conduct of experiments on specific instrumentation from any location. The aim of this paper is to introduce an easy accessible Remote Laboratory Measuring System (RLMS) to provide the students to perform laboratory experiments on actual measurement instrumentation over any smart mobile device, tablets or desktops and PCs. The proposed architecture on real laboratory setup provides solutions for remote access and opens ways for future developments. The system is realized using LabVIEW graphical programming environment which confers its advantages.",68
"It is well established that certain categories of objects are processed more efficiently than others in specific tasks; a phenomenon known as category-specificity in perceptual and conceptual processing. In the last two decades there have also been several reports of gender differences in category-specificity. In the present experiments we test the proposition that such gender differences have an evolutionary origin. If they do, we would expect them to emerge even when the population tested comprises young individuals raised in a gender-equality oriented society. Contrary to this expectation we find no evidence of gender differences in category-specificity in a relatively large sample (N = 366) drawn from such a population; and this despite the fact that both tasks applied (object decision and superordinate categorization) gave rise to reliable category-effects. We suggest that a plausible account of this discrepancy is that previous reports of gender differences may have reflected differences in familiarity originating from socially-based gender roles.

"Purpose of Review Galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal) is a carbohydrate allergen with several unique characteristics. In this article, we discuss some recent advances in our understanding of the 'alpha-gal syndrome,' highlight data supporting the role of ticks in pathogenesis, and speculate on immune mechanisms that lead to sensitization. Recent Findings First described as the target of IgE in individuals suffering immediate hypersensitivity reactions to the novel anti-EGF monoclonal antibody cetuximab, it is now clear that a-gal sensitization is associated with mammalian meat allergy as well as reactions to other mammalian products. Unlike traditional IgE-mediated food allergies, reactions to a-gal often do not manifest until several hours following an exposure, although co-factors can influence the presentation. Multiple pieces of evidence, including recent work with a mouse model, point to the fact that sensitization is mediated by exposure to certain hard ticks and increasingly we are aware of its globally widespread impact. Summary The oligosaccharide a-gal represents a novel allergen with several unusual clinical features. It has been recognized now on multiple continents and its clinical presentation can be quite variable. Moreover, efforts to delineate the mechanisms leading to a-gal sensitization may have ramifications for our broader understanding of type 2 immunity.",105
"In recent years the short-chain fatty acid, 4-phenylbutyrate (PB), has emerged as a promising drug for various clinical conditions. In fact, PB has been Food and Drug Administration-approved for urea cycle disorders since 1996. PB is more potent and less toxic than its metabolite, phenylacetate (PA), and is not just a pro-drug for PA, as was initially assumed. The metabolic pathway of PB, however, has remained unclear. Therefore, we set out to identify the enzymes involved in the beta-oxidation of PB. We used cells deficient in specific steps of fatty acid beta-oxidation and ultra-HPLC to measure which enzymes were able to convert PB or its downstream products. We show that the first step in PB oxidation is catalyzed solely by the enzyme, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The second (hydration) step can be catalyzed by all three mitochondrial enoyl-CoA hydratase enzymes, i.e., short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase, long-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase, and 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase. Enzymes involved in the third step include both short-and long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The oxidation of PB is completed by only one enzyme, i.e., long-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase.(jlr) Taken together, the enzymatic characteristics of the PB degradative pathway may lead to better dose finding and limiting the toxicity of this drug.",36
"Aims and objectives: to critically appraise the available literature and summarise the evidence relating to adolescent mothers' use of social networking sites in terms of any social support and social capital they may provide and to identify areas for future exploration. Background: social networking sites have been demonstrated to provide social support to marginalised individuals and provide psycho-social benefits to members of such groups. Adolescent mothers are at risk of; social marginalisation; anxiety disorders and depressive symptoms; and poorer health and educational outcomes for their children. Social support has been shown to benefit adolescent mothers thus online mechanisms require consideration. Design: a review of original research articles Method: key terms and Boolean operators identified research reports across a 20-year timeframe pertaining to the area of enquiry in: CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Medline, Scopus, ERIC, ProQuest, PsychINFO, Web of Science, Health Collection (Informit) and Google Scholar databases. Eight original research articles met the inclusion criteria for this review. Findings: studies demonstrate that adolescent mothers actively search for health information using the Internet and social networking sites, and that social support and social capital can be attributed to their use of specifically created online groups from within targeted health interventions. Use of a message board forum for pregnant and parenting adolescents also demonstrates elements of social support. There are no studies to date pertaining to adolescent mothers' use of globally accessible social networking sites in terms of social support provision and related outcomes. Conclusions: further investigation is warranted to explore the potential benefits of adolescent mothers' use of globally accessible social networking sites in terms of any social support provision and social capital they may provide.",18
"Cancer cachexia is a severe and disabling clinical condition that frequently accompanies the development of many types of cancer. Muscle wasting is the hallmark of cancer cachexia and is associated with serious clinical consequences such as physical impairment, poor quality of life, reduced tolerance to treatments and shorter survival. Cancer cachexia may evolve through different stages of clinical relevance, namely pre-cachexia, cachexia and refractory cachexia. Given its detrimental clinical consequences, it appears mandatory to prevent and/or delay the progression of cancer cachexia to its refractory stage by implementing the early recognition and treatment of the nutritional and metabolic alterations occurring during cancer. Research on the molecular mechanisms underlying muscle wasting during cancer cachexia has expanded in the last few years, allowing the identification of several potential therapeutic targets and the development of many promising drugs. Several of these agents have already reached the clinical evaluation, but it is becoming increasingly evident that a single therapy may not be completely successful in the treatment of cancer-related muscle wasting, given its multifactorial and complex pathogenesis. This suggests that early and structured multimodal interventions (including targeted nutritional supplementation, physical exercise and pharmacological interventions) are necessary to prevent and/or treat the devastating consequences of this cancer comorbidity, and future research should focus on this approach.",121
"Rationale: In the absence of a surgical lung biopsy, patients diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in clinical practice could participate in the INPULSIS trials of nintedanib if they had honeycombing and/or traction bronchiectasis plus reticulation, without atypical features of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). Thus, the patients in these trials represented patients with definite UIP and a large subgroup of patients with possible UIP. Objectives: To investigate the potential impact of diagnostic subgroups on the progression of IPF and the effect of nintedanib. Method's: We conducted a post hoc subgroup analysis of patients with honeycombing on HRCT and/or confirmation of UIP by biopsy versus patients without either, using pooled data from the INPULSIS trials. Measurements and Main Results: Seven hundred twenty-three (68.1%) patients had honeycombing and/or biopsy, and 338 (31.9%) patients had no honeycombing or biopsy. In these subgroups, respectively, the adjusted annual rate of decline in FVC in patients treated with placebo was -225.7 and -221.0 ml/yr, and the nintedanib versus placebo difference in the adjusted annual rate of decline in FVC was 117.0 ml/yr (95% confidence interval, 76.3-157.8) and 98.9 ml/yr (95% confidence interval, 36.4-161.5). There was no significant treatment-by-subgroup interaction (P = 0.8139). Adverse events were similar between the subgroups. Conclusions: Patients with IPF diagnosed in clinical practice who had possible UIP with traction bronchiectasis on HRCT and had not undergone surgical lung biopsy had disease that progressed in a similar way, and responded similarly to nintedanib, to that of patients with honeycombing on HRCT and/or confirmation of UIP by biopsy.",3
"In this paper, we first make a brief review of the general method of solving master equation of density operator, which includes the C-number method method and the super-operator method. The C-number can transform quantum master equation into Fokker-Plank equation or the differential equation of density matrix elements, and this method has a wide applicable range but the Fokker-Plank equation and differential equation are difficult to solve. Besides, the solution is not always applicable for any initial condition. The super-operator method can solve master equation efficiently compared with C-number method, however the solving process of super-operator method mostly depends on the characteristics of Lie algebra. For instance, if the corresponding Lindblad operator can be divided into the generators of Su(2) or Su(1,1) Lie group, the super-operator is no longer applicable. Thus although super-operator is more efficiently than C-number method, it has a narrow applicable range. Furthermore, other researchers have made much effort to develop super-operator method, for instance, S.J. Wang proposed the left and right action operator, the left operator is the same as the general operator, while the right action operator from the right side acts on other general operator, thus the explicit formation of super-operator can be given by this method. Fan proposed the thermal entangled state representation which can convert operator between real mode and fictitious mode. All these developments depend on Lie algebra, thus they all have a narrow applicable range just like super-operator method. We introduce a new Ket-Bra entangled state (KBES) method in this paper, which can transform master equation into Schrodinger-like equation with the corresponding Ket-Bra entangled state. Then one can use the method of Schrodinger equation such as time evolution method, perturbation method, etc. to solve the master equation. Compared with C-number method and super-operator method, the KBES method has several merits. 1) A wide applicable range, KBES method is applicable for any master equation of finite-level system in theory. 2) Compatibility with computer programming, the most crucial procedure is to calculate the exponent of Lindblad operator e(Ft) which needs the diagonalization of F, and all this can be finished by computer. 3) Most mature methods of Schrodinger equation can be used to solve master equation because of the KBES method can transform master equation into Schrodinger-like equation. Then we study the model which two-level qubit is coupled with reservoir under time-varying external field, the corresponding master equation is deduced and solved by KBES method. Furthermore, we analyze the decoherence evolution of density operator and we consider the entanglement evolutions of two uncoupled qubit cases. We find that the external field seriously influences the decoherence process. The off-diagonal elements rho(10) (t) become damply oscillated when the external field exists, and the frequency of oscillate keeps growing along with Lambda(gamma). Besides, the dynamic evolution of concurrence is also influenced by the external field, which leads to the occurrence of both entanglement sudden death and entanglement sudden birth, while the last ESB phenomenon only happens under the external field. Thus, we thought that one can suppress the decoherence and disentanglement process by exerting suitable time-varying external field on the open system, of course, the suitable external field can also be obtained by our KBES method in theory.",40
"Using dedicated stereo camera systems and structured light is a well-known method for measuring the 3D shape of large surfaces. However the problem is not trivial when high accuracy, in the range of few tens of microns, is needed. Many error sources need to be handled carefully in order to obtain high quality results. In this study, we present a measurement method based on low-cost camera and illumination solutions combined with high-precision image analysis and a new approach in camera calibration and 3D reconstruction. The setup consists of two ordinary digital cameras and a Gobo projector as a structured light source. A matrix of dots is projected onto the target area. The two cameras capture the images of the projected pattern on the object. The images are processed by advanced subpixel resolution algorithms prior to the application of the 3D reconstruction technique. The strength of the method lays in a different approach for calibration, 3D reconstruction, and high-precision image analysis algorithms. Using a 10 mm pitch pattern of the light dots, the method is capable of reconstructing the 3D shape of surfaces. The precision (1 sigma repeatability) in the measurements is < 10 mu m over a volume of 60 x 50 x 10 cm(3) at a hardware cost of similar to 2% of available advanced measurement techniques. The expanded uncertainty (95% confidence level) is estimated to be 83 mu m, with the largest uncertainty contribution coming from the absolute length of the metal ruler used as reference.",90
"DLV is a powerful system for knowledge representation and reasoning which supports Answer Set Programming (ASP) - a logicbased programming paradigm for solving problems in a fully declarative way. DLV is widely used in academy, and, importantly, it has been fruitfully employed in many relevant industrial applications. As for the other main-stream ASP systems, in the first phase of the computation DLV eliminates the variables, generating a ground program which is semantically equivalent to the original one but significantly smaller than the Herbrand Instantiation, in general. This phase, called 'grounding', plays a key role for the successful deployment in real-world contexts. In this work we present I-DLV, a brand new version of the intelligent grounder of DLV. While relying on the solid theoretical foundations of its predecessor, it has been completely redesigned and re-engineered, both in algorithms and data structures; it now features full support to ASP-Core2 standard language, increased flexibility and customizability, significantly improved performances, and an extensible design that eases the incorporation of language updates and optimization techniques. I-DLV results in a stable and efficient ASP instantiator that turns out to be a full-fledged deductive database system. We describe the main features of I-DLV and carry out experimental activities for assessing applicability and performances.",41
"Background: Care workers are often exposed to sexual harassment from patients. Research shows that such exposure may have detrimental effects on mental health of the care workers. Inappropriate sexual behaviour from patients is a particular challenge for formal and informal care workers alike. There is a scarceness of studies investigating the experience and the handling of sexual harassment from patients. Objectives: To investigate the experience and handling of sexual harassment from patients in care work. Design: The study follows an explorative qualitative approach based on group interviews (n = 19) with 39 care workers. Settings: Ten workplaces participated in the study, including hospitals, nursing homes, community health centres, rehabilitations care centres, and psychiatric residential facilities. Participants: We conducted group interviews with care workers (employees), managers, shop stewards and/or safety representatives. The majority of the interviewees were trained nurses. Results: The interviews revealed that sexual harassment is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon. The care workers often separated between intentional and unintentional behaviours initiated by cognitively impaired patients. Thus, they often refrain from using the term harassment, because it implies that the actions were intentional. However, the interviews revealed that, in practice, this separation was very difficult, and that sexual harassment often creates a range of dilemmas in the daily work. At the same time, sexual harassment is a taboo. The managers, shop stewards and safety representatives in this study were often not aware of the frequency and the impact of the episodes had on the care workers. The workplaces participating in this study, rarely had guidelines or policies for managing and/or preventing sexual harassment or inappropriate sexual behaviours, but often responded to episodes in an ad hoc and case-by case manner. Conclusion: The term sexual harassment might not be appropriate in the context of care work, because many patients who display inappropriate behaviours are cognitively impaired. While the interviews revealed that there is no universally accepted term, it might be more prudent to avoid the term harassment and refer it to as sexual behaviours. Considering the demographic development with a rising number of elderly and the increase in various forms of dementia, the management of inappropriate sexual behaviour by patients will be even more pressing in the future. It is time to address the prevention of sexual harassment and the management of patients' sexuality as an explicit part of the professional organisational culture of care work. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"Objectives: To describe longitudinal relationships of metabolic syndrome (MetS) to cognitive decline and functional disability in a sample of older non-institutionalized men. Methods: data from 1991 to 2000 of the Italian cohorts of the Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, Elderly (FINE) study, were used. Global cognitive function and functional disability, defined as limitations in mobility, basic (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) were screened in 1991 and 2000. MetS was defined according to the NCEP ATP-III criteria. Results: The study sample consisted of 195 men, baseline age 76.1 +/- 3.1 years. Baseline MetS was prospectively associated with greater 10-year cognitive and functional decline in ADLs and IADLs. After multiple adjustment including age, education, marital status, ApoE epsilon 4 allele, cerebrovascular disease and initial cognitive and depressive status, MetS predicted cognitive decline (B = - 1.684, 95% CI = - 2.202 to - 1.167, p < 0.001) and risk of IADLs (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.01-1.20, p = 0.048) and ADLs disability (OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.12-1.62, p < 0.001). Interestingly, such associations were not attributable to individual altered components of MetS nor to their sum. Incident disability in ADLs and IADLs were not explained by parallel decline in cognitive function. Conclusions: MetS as an entity was associated with accelerated cognitive and functional decline in a population-based sample of very old men. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",69
"The power system monitoring problem asks for as few as possible measurement devices to be put in an electric power system. The problem has a graph theory model involving power dominating set in graphs. The concept of -power domination, first introduced by Chang et al. (Discret Appl Math 160:1691-1698, 2012), is a common generalization of domination and power domination. In this paper, we present a linear-time algorithm for -power domination in block graphs.",50
"The gene expression level for immune system genes was evaluated at different lifecycle stages in the white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). The gene-coding pattern recognition protein, -glucan binding protein-high density lipoprotein (BGBP), from haemocytes, the effector proteins peroxinectin and clotting protein (CP), the antibacterial proteins Lysozyme, Penaeidin 3 and prophenoloxidase (proPO), and the small heat-shock protein 10 were studied. The expression of BGBP was detected from the Nauplii 3 substage and beyond (except for PL1). Peroxinectin and CP were constitutively transcribed throughout the different substages. Lysozyme, Penaeidin and proPO were also detected throughout the experimental stages (except eggs and nauplii). Lysozyme was transcribed during most of the shrimp substages, from Zoea 2 and beyond. Penaeidin 3 exhibited the lowest expression level of the genes evaluated; however, its transcription was similar to those of adults from post-larvae 11 and forward. proPO was higher transcribed during last post-larval substages. Heat-shock protein-10 was detected in all shrimp substages and exhibited higher expression at the PL substages compared to the first larval substages. Evidence suggests that the shrimp immune system is partially activated from the early larval substages, but is not completed until the shrimp have undergone the metamorphic substages.",33
"The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease involves multiple pathways that, at the macrolevel, include decreased proliferation plus increased loss affecting neurons, astrocytes, and capillaries and, at the subcellular level, involve several elements: amyloid/amyloid precursor protein, presenilins, the unfolded protein response, the ubiquitin/proteasome system, the Wnt/catenin system, the Notch signaling system, mitochondria, mitophagy, calcium, and tau. Data presented show the intimate, anatomical interactions between neurons, astrocytes, and capillaries; the interactions between the several subcellular factors affecting those cells; and the treatments that are currently available and that might correct dysfunctions in the subcellular factors. Available treatments include lithium, valproate, pioglitazone, erythropoietin, and prazosin. Since the subcellular pathogenesis involves multiple interacting elements, combination treatment would be more effective than administration of a single drug directed at only 1 element. The overall purpose of this presentation is to describe the pathogenesis in detail and to explain the proposed treatments.",106
"People perceive that if their memories and moral beliefs changed, they would change. We investigated why individuals respond this way. In Study 1, participants judged that identity would change more after changes to memories and widely shared moral beliefs (e.g., about murder) versus preferences and controversial moral beliefs (e.g., about abortion). The extent to which participants judged that changes would affect their relationships predicted identity change (Study 2) and mediated the relationship between type of moral belief and perceived identity change (Study 3). We discuss the role that social relationships play in judgments of identity and highlight implications for psychology and philosophy.",62
"This paper studies the evolution of crescent-shaped dune under the influence of injected flux. A scaling law and a wind tunnel experiment are carried out for comparison. The experiment incorporates a novel image processing algorithm to recover the evolutionary process. The theoretical and experimental results agree well in the middle stage of dune evolution, but deviate from each other in the initial and final stages, suggesting that the crescent-shaped dune evolution is intrinsically scale-variant and that the crescent shape breaks down under unsaturated condition.",90
"Certain types of joint injuries, common in athletes, are known to have a high association with the development of osteoarthritis (OA). Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is especially debilitating due to its earlier onset than traditional OA, and its predisposition to affect a younger and more active population. Five common athletic injuries have been demonstrated to be risk factors for the development of OA. These include ACL rupture, meniscus tear, glenohumeral instability, patellar dislocation, and ankle instability. Though the mechanisms responsible for the development of PTOA are not entirely clear, certain kinematic, biologic, and mechanical factors have been implicated. In addition, there has been an increased emphasis on development of new methods to detect early OA changes in patients with known risk factors, as early intervention may prevent the development of end-stage OA. New imaging modalities as well as the identification of specific biomarkers may allow earlier detection. Though these developments hold promise, it is not entirely known what steps we can take today to prevent the future development of OA, even with early detection.

"A general synthesis procedure is given for a versatile signal flow graph realization of a general transfer function by using current differencing buffered amplifier (CDBA). The proposed configuration uses n + 1 CDBAs, n capacitors and at most 2n + 4 resistors. This number of resistors can be reduced to n + I for special cases. The circuit is eligible to obtain a variety of transfer characteristics with the same common denominator polynomial, and it is easily converted to different modes of operations. It is straightforward to find the values of the passive elements from the coefficients of the transfer function to be realized. Simulations results are obtained by using commercially available active component AD844 and CMOS technology as well. All of these make the proposed circuit attractive. (c) 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

"By integrating next-generation sequencing (NGS), bioinformatics, electron microscopy and conventional molecular biology tools, a new virus infecting kiwifruit vines has been identified and characterized. Being associated with double-membrane-bound bodies in infected tissues and having a genome composed of RNA segments, each one containing a single open reading frame in negative polarity, this virus shows the typical features of members of the genus Emaravirus. Five genomic RNA segments were identified. Additional molecular signatures in the viral RNAs and in the proteins they encode, together with data from phylogenetic analyses, support the proposal of creating a new species in the genus Emaravirus to classify the novel virus, which is tentatively named Actinidia chlorotic ringspot-associated virus (AcCRaV). Bioassays showed that AcCRaV is mechanically transmissible to Nicotiana benthamiana plants which, in turn, may develop chlorotic spots and ringspots. Field surveys disclosed the presence of AcCRaV in four different species of kiwifruit vines in five different provinces of central and western China, and support the association of the novel virus with symptoms of leaf chlorotic ringspots in Actinidia. Data on the molecular features of small RNAs of 21-24 nucleotides, derived from AcCRaV RNAs targeted by host RNA silencing mechanisms, are also reported, and possible molecular pathways involved in their biogenesis are discussed.",42

"The introduction of the birth control pill (the Pill) in 1960 revolutionized the options for contraception, sparking vibrant discussion in the scientific and social science literature and in the media. Much attention focused on issues of women's rights, including ethics and personal choice. But the Pill also introduced new questions about risk. Shortly after its introduction, the risk of thromboembolic disease was recognized [1]. After more than half a century, controversies about the relationship between the Pill and thromboembolic disease have persisted. The scientific and media communities have been active in the discussion, debate and delivery of information about this risk. Scientific and public attention to thromboembolism and the Pill has had dramatic consequences, both good and bad. The spotlight on risk has helped to change norms regarding the public's right to know and assess dangers; it has sparked Pill scares linked to increased unplanned pregnancy, birth and abortion rates; and it has led to a change in federally mandated policies regarding how new contraceptive products are studied and brought to market. This paper charts the narrative of the thromboembolic risk of the Pill from its introduction in 1960 until today and reviews the corresponding media response to this history. How does the story of the thromboembolic risk of the Pill explored through the lens of science, media and contemporary social dynamics frame contemporary understanding of risk for researchers, clinicians, individuals and the public?

"In order to research the field sensing characteristic of the carbon fiber smart material, the Tikhonov regularization principle and the modified Newton-Raphson(MNR) algorithm were adopted to solve the inverse problem of the electrical resistance tomography (ERT). An ERT system of carbon fiber smart material was developed. Field sensing characteristic was researched with the experiment. The experimental results show that the specific resistance distribution of carbon fiber smart material is highly consistent with the distribution of structural strain. High resistance zone responds to high strain area, and the specific resistance distribution of carbon fiber smart material reflects the distribution of sample strain in covering area. Monitoring by carbon fiber smart material on complicated strain status in sample field domain is realized through theoretical and experimental study.",103
"Background: One of the essential aspects of the provision of care is cultural issues. Cultural sensitivity is the key for cultural care. The aim of this study was to explore culturally sensitive care in pediatric nursing care in Iran. Materials and Methods: This study was a conventional content analysis. Participants were consisted of 25 nurses and 9 parents selected through purposive sampling from three pediatric referral centers in Tabriz and Tehran, Iran. Data was collected using semi-structured interviews and field notes and were concurrently analyzed by using Graneheim and Lundman (2004) method. Data was transcribed verbatim, words, sentences, and phrases were considered meaning units, abstracted, labeled and compared for developing categories. Results: Culturally sensitive care of a sick child was consisted of three themes: 'cultural exposure', 'intercultural communication' and 'the reconciliation of cultural conflict in families/care'. During the 'cultural exposure' nurses were informed of the cultural manifestations, strived to identify and understand patients/families with cultural diversities and respect their cultural beliefs. The nurse used the native language in 'intercultural communication' or a combination of verbal and nonverbal communication methods to reach a common understanding. Finally, a nurse in the conflict between the culture of child/family and care took actions for making decisions to develop a compliance between care and the family culture and amended parents' harmful desires through negotiation and appropriate care. Conclusion: Understanding the concept of culturally sensitive care, can help with resolving the problems of cultural exchanges in Pediatric wards. Providing cultural facilities and interpreters to communicate with patients/family increase their satisfaction.",64
"Patterns of myeloid growth factor (GF) usage and febrile neutropenia (FN) were examined in patients>60 years of age with diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (DLBCL) enrolled on CALGB 9793/ECOG-SWOG 4494, receiving initial therapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) or rituximab+CHOP (R-CHOP). Myeloid GFs were administered to 256/520 (49%) patients. Indications for use were: prevent dose reduction/dose delay (81%, 207/256); treat FN or non-febrile neutropenia (NFN) (19%, 48/256). One or more FN episodes occurred in 41% (212/520) of patients, with FN most often in cycle 1 (38% of episodes). In multivariate analysis, risk factors for FN included age>65 years (odds ratio (OR)=2.6, 95% CI: [1.4, 4.9]) and anemia (hemoglobin<12g/dl) (OR =2.2, 95% confidence intervals (CI): [1.4, 3.5]. Myeloid GF use was common in this older DLBCL population receiving CHOP-based therapy, as was FN, especially during cycle one. Risk factors predictive for FN should be used prospectively to identify patients for whom myeloid GFs are best utilized.",7
"Computational grids are established with the intention of providing shared access to hardware and software based resources with special reference to increased computational capabilities. Fault tolerance is one of the most important issues faced by the computational grids. The main contribution of this survey is the creation of an extended classification of problems that incur in the computational grid environments. The proposed classification will help researchers, developers, and maintainers of grids to understand the types of issues to be anticipated. Moreover, different types of problems, such as omission, interaction, and timing related have been identified that need to be handled on various layers of the computational grid. In this survey, an analysis and examination is also performed pertaining to the fault tolerance and fault detection mechanisms. Our conclusion is that a dependable and reliable grid can only be established when more emphasis is on fault identification. Moreover, our survey reveals that adaptive and intelligent fault identification, and tolerance techniques can improve the dependability of grid working environments.",2
"In Qatar, dabigatran was introduced in 2011 followed by rivaroxaban in 2014. In this study, we aim to explore the trends in oral anticoagulant use in Qatar over the past 5 years and to what extent did DOACs replace warfarin. We also explored the extent of switching between different anticoagulants (from warfarin to DOACs and vice versa). We collected all anticoagulant prescriptions dispensed as in-or out-patient from 2011 to 2015 in all Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) hospitals. Overall number of patients using warfarin, dabigatran and rivaroxaban over the last 5 years collectively was calculated. Per each calendar year, we calculated the number of all 3 OAC used (warfarin, dabigatran and rivaroxaban), frequency of use of each one of the OAC prescribed and compared the change in proportion of DOACs to warfarin prescriptions over the years. Overall, 6961 patients were using OAC over the past 5 years among which 5849 (84%) used warfarin, 496 (7.1%) used dabigatran and 616 (8.8%) used rivaroxaban. Oral anticoagulants use increased gradually from 2091 in 2011 to 3688 in 2015. Number of patients receiving DOACs increased significantly compared to warfarin [ 11 (0.5%) in 2011 vs. 849 (23%) in 2015 (p < 0.0001)]. Since its introduction in 2014, number of rivaroxaban users increased significantly compared to dabigatran [ 212 (40.9%) in 2014 vs. 544 ( 64.1%) in 2015]. DOACs have been gradually replacing warfarin in Qatar and the trend of their use is similar to that reported in other countries. Warfarin remains the most commonly used oral anticoagulant.",111
"Network intrusion attempts have been on the rise recently. Researchers have shown an increased interest in assessing the security situation for entire network instead of single asset. A considerable amount of assessment models have been designed. However, there is a lack of solid and standard guidelines to define the importance of network asset. In addition, based on our knowledge, no research has been found that adequately covered the cost factor in the assessment model. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to propose a cost-sensitive entropy-based network security situation assessment model. With the aid of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), the model can quantitatively determine the importance of assets in the network by considering the tangible and intangible criteria. To verify the performance of proposed model, a simulation of National Advanced IPv6 Centre (NAv6)'s network environment has been setup. The simulation results regarding security situation in particular time-interval are promising. Hence, the proposed model is able to provide network administrator a more reliable reference before any further decision making for the organization's network.",46
"Introduction and hypothesis Mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) can be a challenging condition to manage. We describe the protocol design and rationale for the Effects of Surgical Treatment Enhanced with Exercise for Mixed Urinary Incontinence (ESTEEM) trial, designed to compare a combined conservative and surgical treatment approach versus surgery alone for improving patient-centered MUI outcomes at 12 months. Methods ESTEEM is a multisite, prospective, randomized trial of female participants with MUI randomized to a standardized perioperative behavioral/pelvic floor exercise intervention phis midurethral sling versus midurethral sling alone. We describe our methods and four challenges encountered during the design phase: defusing the study population, selecting relevant patient-centered outcomes, determining sample size estimates using a patient-reported outcome measure, and designing an analysis plan that accommodates MUI failure rates. A central theme in the design was patient centeredness, which guided many key decisions. Our primary outcome is patient reported MUI symptoms measured using the Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI) score at 12 months. Secondary outcomes include quality of life, sexual function, cost-effectiveness, time to failure, and need for additional treatment. Results The final study design was implemented in November 2013 across eight clinical sites in the Pelvic Floor Disorders Network. As of 27 February 2016, 433 total/472 targeted participants had been randomized. Conclusions We describe the ESTEEM protocol and our methods for reaching consensus for methodological challenges in designing a trial for MUI by maintaining the patient perspective at the core of key decisions. This trial will provide information that can directly impact patient care and clinical decision making.",17
"This pilot study compared sedentary behavior (SB) of children with autism (ASD) to typically developing peers (TD), and evaluated the influence of social contexts within free play (FP) and organized activity settings on SB of children with ASD during an inclusive summer camp. Participants with ASD were matched with TD peers by age and gender, and a modified OSRAC-P was utilized to assess SB and social context by setting. SB did not differ by diagnosis (ASD, TD), setting, or social contexts. In FP, children with ASD spent significantly more time in SB within social contexts compared to solitary contexts. ASD-related social deficits may facilitate SB in children with ASD during summer camp FP social contexts, compared to a solitary context.",113
"Viral hepatitis contributes to significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. While acute infection may be self-limiting, unrecognised chronic infection and under-utilisation of guideline-based approaches to therapy contribute to increasing rates of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and death. Our aim was to review the current evidence for screening, diagnosis and treatment in hepatitis A to E. Evidence for this review was sourced from international and Australian guidelines and high-quality clinical trials. MEDLINE was searched using structured key word strategy and retrieved articles were reviewed methodically to inform a brief and up-to-date synopsis of hepatitis A to E. We share some of the recent developments in viral hepatitis, specifically the new therapies for hepatitis C. Direct-acting antiviral therapies are safe, well-tolerated and effective. Subsidies allow access for all Australians with most strains of hepatitis C. We outline evidence underpinning efficacy and safety of treatment for hepatitis B, while clarifying some of the nuances in the setting of pregnancy and immunosuppression. We provide a simplified concept to facilitate understanding of the five phases of hepatitis B; practical for real-world setting. Hepatitis A to E is a broad topic, not all aspects of these viruses can be covered in this short review. We provided suggestions for evidence based guidelines, which are a suitable supplement to this article.",130
"Objective.-To investigate headache-related serum melatonin levels and melatonin excretion rhythmicity in patients with hypnic headache (HH). Background.-Strict sleep dependency of headache attacks is a pathognomonic feature of HH. Changes in melatonin levels, a marker for circadian rhythm, are assumed to play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of HH. Methods.-Serum melatonin levels were acquired in nine patients with HH and nine age-and gender-matched healthy controls over a 20-hour time period (12 pm, 4 pm, 7 pm, 10 pm, time of headache, and 8 am). Results.-No significant changes of melatonin levels could be detected comparing HH patients and healthy controls. Melatonin excretion rhythmicity was not significantly altered in patients with HH (Mean melatonin level in ng/mL +/- SD, patients vs controls at 12 pm: 21.5 +/- 9.5 vs 13.6 +/- 6.3 [P = .077], 4 pm: 18.4 +/- 8.4 vs 14.0 +/- 4.7 [P = .222], 7 pm: 19.4 +/- 5.1 vs 15.1 +/- 4.5 [P = .094], 10 pm: 59.5 +/- 45.0 vs 29.4 +/- 12.7 [P =.136], headache time: 96.9 +/- 68.3 vs 49.1 +/- 22.8 [P = .94], and 8 am: 31.6 +/- 18.3 vs 26.7 +/- 15.6 [P = .489]). Conclusion.-This study is not able to confirm a significant role of melatonin concentration changes in the pathophysiology of HH and vetoes that melatonin deficiency plays a major role in the pathophysiology of the disorder.",127
"Robotic manipulators have been widely used in many arenas; when the robotic arm performs positioning, traditional controller (e.g., PID controller) has the problem of not being able to compensate the payload variations, i.e., when the end-effector of the robotic arm grasps different payload masses, as most applications require, the output of joint motion will vary, which decreases end-effector positioning accuracy of the robotic arm system. Based on the model reference control approach, the payload variation effect can be solved effectively and therefore, to further improve the robotic arm positioning accuracy performance.",59
"Recent field measurements on long-span bridges during typhoon events have captured strong nonstationary features in the buffeting responses. In this study, the buffeting responses of Sutong Bridge during Typhoon Haikui in 2012 recorded by structural health monitoring system are analyzed to represent the nonstationary characteristics. As an accurately measured state variable, the acceleration response of the main girder is first selected to evaluate its own original stationarity in different time intervals using the run test method. The acceleration response of the main girder can be regarded as a zero-mean nonstationary random process which is in demand to extract its transient features in time-frequency domain. Hence, the evolutionary power spectral density (EPSD) of the acceleration responses, which can present the local turbulence energy distribution in both frequency and time domains, is estimated using the wavelet-based method. Also, an average wavelet spectrum is obtained by averaging the square values of wavelet coefficients along the time axis, and the comparison between the average wavelet spectrum and Fourier spectrum shows a great conformance which indirectly verifies the validity of the obtained evolutionary power spectral density. The results of this study exhibit that there are strong nonstationary characteristics existing in the buffeting responses of Sutong Bridge during Typhoon Haikui, and it is essential to incorporate the nonstationary features of winds in the analysis or design of long-span bridges from an aerodynamic viewpoint.",97
"Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic skin disease which has been known to negatively influence the mental health of patients. However, only a few studies have explored the prevalence of psychiatric problems among AD patients, particularly among adolescents. In this study, we aimed to assess the association of AD with depressive symptoms and suicidal behaviors among adolescents by analyzing data from the 2013 Korean Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a nationwide web-based survey. Methods: Data from 72,435 adolescent middle and high school students in Korea were analyzed. Students self-reported AD diagnosed by a doctor and yes-or-no answers to questions about depressive symptoms and suicide ideation, suicide planning, and suicide attempts were analyzed. Relationships between AD and depressive symptoms or suicidal behaviors were tested by logistic regression models after controlling for potential confounding factors. Results: The proportion of adolescents who had AD was 6.8%. The proportion of adolescents reporting depressive feelings was 31.0%, suicide ideation was 16.3%, suicide planning was 5.8%, and suicide attempts was 4.2%. Compared to adolescents without AD, adolescents with AD were significantly more likely to experience depressive feelings (odds ratio [OR]: 1.27, 95% confidence interval [Cl]: 1.19-1.36), suicide ideation (OR: 1.34, 95% Cl: 1.24-1.45), suicide planning (OR: 1.46, 95% Cl: 1.32-1.65), and suicide attempts (OR: 1.51, 95% Cl: 1.33-1.72). In the multivariate model, the relationships between AD and suicide ideation (OR: 1.26, 95% Cl: 1.16-1.36), suicide planning (OR: 1.28, 95% Cl: 1.14-1.44), and suicide attempt (OR: 1.29, 95% Cl: 1.13-1.49) were statistically significant. Conclusion: Adolescents who have AD are associated with a higher prevalence of depression symptoms and suicidal behaviors. Adolescent AD patients may need interventions from clinicians and caregivers that use a holistic approach to prevent psychological comorbidities, although further research is needed to clarify this relationship.",110
"Our previous studies have demonstrated that KLF4 is a critical transcription factor that promotes the odontoblastic differentiation of dental papilla cells. Klf4 mRNA was found to be regulated by multiple microRNAs (miRNAs). Competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) are a group of transcripts post transcriptionally regulating each other by competing for their common miRNAs. However, the regulation of Klf4 by ceRNAs in odontoblastic differentiation remains unknown. In this study, we predicted a group of potential Klf4 ceRNAs with bioinformatics approach, and examined the expression of Klf4 and five interested potential ceRNAs including Sp1 using real-time PCR during odontoblastic differentiation of mDPC6T. The expression levels of both Sp1 and Klf4 were significantly upregulated during this process. In situ hybridization verified that Spi was co-expressed with Klf4 in the differentiating and the mature odontoblasts in vivo. Knockdown of Spl using siRNA resulted in a significant reduction of laf4 and vice visa. This interaction was further confirmed to be miRNA dependent. Common miRNAs of Klf4 and Spi were predicted, among which miR-7a, miR-29b and miR-135a were able to downregulate both Klf4 and Spl expression after their separate overexpression in the mDPC6T cells. Dual luciferase assays showed that these miRNAs separately regulated the 3'UTRs of both Klf4 and Spi, and the down-regulation of Klf4 3 'UTR by Spl siRNA was abolished when these three miRNAs' binding sites were mutated in the Klf4 3 'UTR. Therefore, our results indicate that Sp1 functions as a ceRNA of Klf4 during odontoblastic differentiation through competing for miR-7a, miR-29b and miR-135a. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"Social class predicts numerous important life outcomes and social orientations. To date, literature has mainly examined how an individual's own class shapes interactions with others. But how prosocially do people treat others they perceive as coming from lower, middle, or higher social classes? Here, in addition to testing effects of self social class on prosocial behavior, we also investigate how target social class affects prosocialbehavior, operationalized using a social mindfulness paradigm that focuses on leaving or limiting choice to others. We offer three lines of reasoning, predicting that lower class targets either elicit greater prosociality than higher class targets (fairness), that higher class targets elicit greater prosociality (status), or that people are most prosocial to targets from their own social class (similarity). Across four studies, we find that participants behave less prosocially (i.e., are less socially mindful) toward higher class targets relative to lower and/or middle class targets. Perceptions of similarity, warmth, and competence did not mediate lower prosociality for higher relative to lower class targets. Together, results are most consistent with a fairness perspective. Across all studies, we also found that self social class had little to no relationship with prosociality.

"In recent years, researchers have been trying to shed light on gaming addiction and its association with different psychiatric disorders and psychological determinants. The latest edition version of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) included in its Section 3 Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) as a condition for further empirical study and proposed nine criteria for the diagnosis of IGD. The 20-item Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD-20) Test was developed as a valid and reliable tool to assess gaming addiction based on the nine criteria set by the DSM-5. The aim of this study is to validate an Arabic version of the IGD-20 Test. The Arabic version of IGD-20 will not only help in identifying Arabic-speaking pathological gamers but also stimulate cross-cultural studies that could contribute to an area in need of more research for insight and treatment. After a process of translation and back-translation and with the participation of a sizable sample of Arabic-speaking adolescents, the present study conducted a psychometric validation of the IGD-20 Test. Our confirmatory factor analysis showed the validity of the Arabic version of the IGD-20 Test. The one-factor model of the Arabic IGD-20 Test had very good psychometric properties, and it fitted the sample data extremely well. In addition, correlation analysis between the IGD-20 Test and the daily duration on weekdays and weekends gameplay revealed significant positive relationships that warranted a criterion-related validation. Thus, the Arabic version of the IGD-20 Test is a valid and reliable measure of IGD among Arabic-speaking populations.",104
"The Last of Us plunges gamers into a decimated world, one in which the majority of the human population has succumbed to the Cordyceps fungal infection. Against the crumbling monoliths of human culture, social constructions of morality and culture are explored through the game's protagonist Joel and the various survivors he encounters. As the narrative unfolds, it asks compelling questions about the nature of morality, the antagonism between the human and natural worlds, and whether or not humanity is worth saving. To this end, the narrative utilizes elements of naturalism and its more modern form, environmental fiction.",126
"Objective:To compare the 2016 United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) modelled estimates of adult mortality in sub-Saharan Africa to empirical estimates.Design:Age-specific mortality rates were obtained from nationally representative sibling survival data, recent household deaths and vital registration, and directly compared with UNAIDS estimates. Orphanhood prevalence derived from UNAIDS mortality estimates was compared with survey and census reports on the survival of children's parents.Methods:Age-specific mortality rates for adults aged 15-59 years were calculated from Demographic and Health Surveys and deaths reported in censuses or vital registration, adjusted for underreporting, whenever possible. Proportions of orphans were extracted from censuses and surveys for children aged 5-9 years.Results:UNAIDS estimates were significantly higher than sibling mortality estimates, except among men in countries with very high HIV prevalence. There was a better agreement between rates based on household deaths or vital registration and model outputs. Sex ratios (M/F) of adult mortality were lower in UNAIDS estimates. The modelled orphan prevalence was significantly higher than in surveys and censuses, again with the exception of paternal orphans in countries with very high HIV prevalence. Ratios of paternal-to-maternal orphans were lower in the UNAIDS model than surveys and censuses. Among women, increases in mortality due to AIDS were more concentrated in the age range 25-50 years in model outputs, as compared with empirical estimates.Conclusion:Discrepancies in levels, sex ratios and age patterns of adult mortality between empirical and UNAIDS estimates call for additional data quality assessments and improvements in estimation methods.

The system of differential equations describing the linear non autonomous multi-pole after quasiequivalence transformations allows to synthesize an equivalent circuit of the multi-pole consisting of two-pole linear, nonlinear resistors, controlled voltage sources, etc. The question of replacing the series-connected voltage sources controlled by the operational amplifier, the implementation of linear and nonlinear two-pole resistors.",45
"Background: This study assessed the feasibility and acceptability of pharmacy and home-based sexually transmissible infection (STI) screening as alternate testing venues among emergency contraception (EC) users. Methods: The study included two phases in February 2011-July 2012. In Phase I, customers purchasing EC from eight pharmacies in Manhattan received vouchers for free STI testing at onsite medical clinics. In Phase II, three Facebook ads targeted EC users to connect them with free home-based STI test kits ordered online. Participants completed a self-administered survey. Results: Only 38 participants enrolled in Phase I: 90% female,45 000 click-throughs, 382 completed the survey and 290 requested kits; 28% were returned. Phase II participants were younger and less educated than Phase I participants; six tested positive for STIs. Challenges included recruitment, pharmacy staff participation, advertising with discretion and cost. Conclusions: This study found low uptake of pharmacy and home-based testing among EC users; however, STI testing in these settings is feasible and the acceptability findings indicate an appeal among younger women for testing in non-traditional settings. Collaborating with and training pharmacy and medical staff are key elements of service provision. Future research should explore how different permutations of expanding screening in non-traditional settings could improve testing uptake and detect additional STI cases.",124
"Pancreatic lipase is a potential therapeutic target to treat diet-induced obesity in humans, as obesity-related diseases continue to be a global problem. Despite intensive research on finding potential inhibitors, very few compounds have been introduced to clinical studies. In this work, new chemical scaffold 1H-indene-(1,3,5,6)-tetrol was proposed using knowledge-based approach, and 36 inhibitors were derived by modifying its functional groups at different positions in scaffold. To explore binding affinity and interactions of ligands with protein, CDOCKER and AutoDock programs were used for molecular docking studies. Analyzing results of rigid and flexible docking algorithms, inhibitors C_12, C_24, and C_36 were selected based on different properties and high predicted binding affinities for further analysis. These three inhibitors have different moieties placed at different functional groups in scaffold, and to characterize structural rationales for inhibitory activities of compounds, molecular dynamics simulations were performed (500 nSec). It has been shown through simulations that two structural fragments (indene and indole) in inhibitor can be treated as isosteric structures and their position at binding cleft can be replaced by each other. Taking into account these information, two lines of inhibitors can further be developed, each line based on a different core scaffold, that is, indene/indole.

"Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), one of the diarrheagenic E. coli pathotypes, is among the most important food-borne pathogens infecting children worldwide. Inhibition of serotonin transporter (SERT), which regulates extracellular availability of serotonin (5-HT), has been implicated previously in EPEC-associated diarrhea. EPEC was shown to inhibit SERT via activation of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase), albeit the specific PTPase involved is not known. Current studies aimed to identify EPEC-activated PTPase and its role in SERT inhibition. Infection of Caco-2 monolayers with EPEC strain E2348/69 for 30 min increased the activity of Srchomology-2 domain containing PTPase (SHP2) but not SHP1 or PTPase 1B. Similarly, Western blot studies showed increased tyrosine phosphorylation of (p-tyrosine) SHP2, indicative of its activation. Concomitantly, EPEC infection decreased SERT p-tyrosine levels. This was associated with increased interaction of SHP2 with SERT, as evidenced by coimmunoprecipitation studies. To examine whether SHP2 directly influences SERT phosphorylation status or function, SHP2 cDNA plasmid constructs (wild type, constitutively active, or dominant negative) were overexpressed in Caco-2 cells by Amaxa electroporation. In the cells overexpressing constitutively active SHP2, SERT polypeptide showed complete loss of p-tyrosine. In addition, there was a decrease in SERT function, as measured by Na+Cl- -sensitive [H-3]5-HT uptake, and an increase in association of SERT with SHP2 in Caco-2 cells expressing constitutively active SHP2 compared with dominant-negative SHP2. Our data demonstrate that intestinal SERT is a target of SHP2 and reveal a novel mechanism by which a common food-borne pathogen uses cellular SHP2 to inhibit SERT. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The data presented in the current study reveal that intestinal serotonin transporter (SERT) is a target of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 and show a novel mechanism by which a common diarrheagenic pathogen, EPEC, activates cellular SHP2 to inhibit SERT function. These studies highlight host-pathogen interactions, which may be of therapeutic relevance in the management of diarrhea associated with enteric infections.",4

"The brain's neocortex is anatomically organized into grey and white matter, which are mainly composed by neuronal and glial cells, respectively. The neocortex can be further divided in different Brodmann areas according to their cytoarchitectural organization, which are associated with distinct cortical functions. There is increasing evidence that brain development and function are governed by epigenetic processes, yet their contribution to the functional organization of the neocortex remains incompletely understood. Herein, we determined the DNA methylation patterns of grey and white matter of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 9), an important region for higher cognitive skills that is particularly affected in various neurological diseases. For avoiding interindividual differences, we analyzed white and grey matter from the same donor using whole genome bisulfite sequencing, and for validating their biological significance, we used Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip and pyrosequencing in ten and twenty independent samples, respectively. The combination of these analysis indicated robust grey-white matter differences in DNA methylation. What is more, cell type-specific markers were enriched among the most differentially methylated genes. Interestingly, we also found an outstanding number of grey-white matter differentially methylated genes that have previously been associated with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease, as well as Multiple and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The data presented here thus constitute an important resource for future studies not only to gain insight into brain regional as well as grey and white matter differences, but also to unmask epigenetic alterations that might underlie neurological and neurodegenerative diseases.",106
"The Karst area in Indonesia consists of a total area of 154.000 km(2) of which 15% is protected. Pacitan is a part of The Thousand Mountains (Gunung Sewu in Javanese language) karst area and located in Southern Coastal of Java Island. Gunung Sewu karst area ranges over 85 km from west in Yogyakarta Special Province, to the east in East Java Province. Water scarcity is one of the issues in Pacitan due to the porous texture of the karst underground; most of the precipitation trickles immediately down into extensive system of sinkholes and caves. Thus, no surface water rivers, brooks or springs can be found in the area, especially during dry season where water supply, such as little lakes, called telaga, are depleted. Three sub-districts of Pacitan that include in Gunung Sewu karst area, i.e. Donorojo, Punung, and Pringkuku, suffer water shortage, especially during dry season, where the local communities need to walk up to 5 kilometers in order to take water for their domestic use. However, State-owned Water Company (Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum/PDAM) that has developed since 1992 in Pacitan, contributes in water supply in these areas and it has covered 70% in three kecamatan (sub-districts) by building IPA and is currently developing to cover the rest of the area by utilizing big water sources. PDAM and The Ministry of Public Work support the water treatment installation (Instalasi Pengolahan Air/IPA), especially in these three sub-districts. Furthermore, adaptive capacity has been developed in the local community of karst area in Pacitan, e.g. planting cultivars resistant to drought (cassava, maize, soybean, and groundnut) or doing multi cropping between those cultivars, and planting rainwater harvesting and artificial aquifer.

"The emergence of smart materials has urged design education to keep up and take part in introducing them to design students. There has been a great deal of work on teaching conventional materials like wood, metal and polymers in product design. Yet when it comes to learning smart materials, the sources are very limited. Our research group in Delft University of Technology has initiated a number of projects, particularly focusing on understanding technical and experiential characteristics of smart materials as materials of design. Our mission is to communicate smart material qualities through pre-design tinkering activities and functional demonstrators, which also serve as a source for inspiration. In this paper, we explain our approach through an example case on electroluminescent materials.",103
"Supplementing well recognised practical models of project and construction management, based on probabilistic and fuzzy events may make possible to transfer the weight of the change and extra orders assessment from the qualitative form to a quantitative one. This assessment, however, is naturally burdened with an immeasurable, subjective aspect. Elaboration of probability of occurrence in a construction project unforeseen building works requires application (in addition to the non-measureable, qualitative criteria) of measurable (quantitative) criteria which still appear during construction project implementation. In reimbursable engineering contracts, a random event described as an extra, supplementary building work has a random character and occurs with a specific likelihood. In lump sum contracts, on the other hand, such a random event has a fuzzy character and its occurrence is defined in a linear manner by the function of affiliation to the set of fuzzy events being identical with unforeseen events. The strive for quantitative presentation of criteria regarded by nature as qualitative and the intention to determine relations between them led to the application of the fuzzy sets theory to this issue. Their properties enable description of the unforeseen works of construction projects in an unambiguous, quantitative way.",102
"Introduction: Since drinking water can be a vehicle for the transmission of pathogens, the detection of enteric viruses in these water samples is essential to establish the appropriate measures to control and prevent associated diseases. Objective: To analyze the results obtained for enteric viruses in water samples for human consumption received at the Colombian Instituto Nacional de Salud and establish their association with the data on water quality in Colombian municipalities. Materials and methods: We conducted a descriptive-retrospective analysis of the results obtained in the detection of rotavirus, enterovirus, hepatitis A virus and adenovirus in water samples received for complementary studies of enteric hepatitis, acute diarrheal disease and foodborne diseases. Data were correlated with the results of water quality surveillance determined by the national human consumption water quality index (IRCA). Results: Of the 288 samples processed from 102 Colombian municipalities, 50.7% were positive for viruses: 26.73% for hepatitis A virus, 20.48% for enterovirus and rotavirus and 18.05% for adenovirus. Viruses were detected in 48.26% of non-treated water samples and in 45.83% of treated water samples. The IRCA index showed no correlation with the presence of viruses. Conclusions: The presence of viruses in water represents a public health risk and, therefore, the prevention of virus transmission through water requires appropriate policies to reinforce water supply systems and improve epidemiological surveillance.",96
"Background: Lake Malawi cichlids represent one of a growing number of vertebrate models used to uncover the genetic and developmental basis of trait diversity. Rapid evolutionary radiation has resulted in species that share similar genomes but differ markedly in phenotypes including brains and behavior, nuptial coloration and the craniofacial skeleton. Research has begun to identify the genes, as well as the molecular and developmental pathways that underlie trait divergence. Results: We assemble a compendium of gene expression for Lake Malawi cichlids, across pharyngula (the phylotypic stage) and larval stages of development, encompassing hundreds of gene transcripts. We chart patterns of expression in Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), Fibroblast growth factor (FGF), Hedgehog (Hh), Notch and Wingless (Wnt) signaling pathways, as well as genes involved in neurogenesis, calcium and endocrine signaling, stem cell biology, and numerous homeobox (Hox) factors-in three planes using whole-mount in situ hybridization. Because of low sequence divergence across the Malawi cichlid assemblage, the probes we employ are broadly applicable in hundreds of species. We tabulate gene expression across general tissue domains, and highlight examples of unexpected expression patterns. Conclusions: On the heels of recently published genomes, this compendium of developmental gene expression in Lake Malawi cichlids provides a valuable resource for those interested in the relationship between evolution and development.",31
"This paper describes a distributed maximum power point tracking control scheme for photovoltaic (PV) systems at the submodule level. The system employs isolated differential power processing (DPP) converters that require no perturb and observe synchronization and little communication among power converters themselves. Design and benefits of this architecture with respect to control, communication, and converter efficiency are analyzed. Isolated dc-dc converter prototypes are constructed and employed within a string of series-connected PV submodules to experimentally validate the proposed control method. An experimental extraction efficiency of 99.12% is achieved for a three submodule connection with similar to 30% mismatch-a 10.19% improvement from the conventional, non-DPP architecture.",48
"Multi-protein complexes, rather than single proteins acting in isolation, often govern molecular pathways regulating cellular homeostasis. Based on this principle, the purification of critical proteins required for the functioning of these pathways along with their native interacting partners has not only allowed the mapping of the protein constituents of these pathways, but has also provided a deeper understanding of how these proteins coordinate to regulate these pathways. Within this context, understanding a protein's spatiotemporal localization and its protein-protein interaction network can aid in defining its role within a pathway, as well as how its misregulation may lead to disease pathogenesis. To address this need, several approaches for protein purification such as tandem affinity purification (TAP) and localization and affinity purification (LAP) have been designed and used successfully. Nevertheless, in order to apply these approaches to pathway-scale proteomic analyses, these strategies must be supplemented with modern technological developments in cloning and mammalian stable cell line generation. Here, we describe a method for generating LAP-tagged human inducible stable cell lines for investigating protein subcellular localization and protein-protein interaction networks. This approach has been successfully applied to the dissection of multiple cellular pathways including cell division and is compatible with high-throughput proteomic analyses.",30
"BackgroundCertain individuals appear to be predisposed to recurrent pasture-associated laminitis. Previous studies have predominantly investigated risk factors only after disease occurrence. ObjectivesTo investigate risk factors for pasture-associated laminitis prior to disease occurrence. Study designProspective cohort study. MethodsNon-laminitic ponies aged 7 years were recruited. Body condition score (BCS), height, weight, crest height and thickness were measured and an overnight dexamethasone suppression test performed. Plasma or serum adiponectin, leptin, triglyceride, basal insulin, insulin post-dexamethasone, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), IGF binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1), IGFBP-3, C-reactive protein, von Willebrand's factor, soluble E-selectin and P-selectin concentrations were assayed. Follow-up data were obtained from owners annually for 3 years to ascertain occurrences of veterinarian-diagnosed pasture-associated laminitis. Data were analysed by multivariate logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis was performed for significant risk factors and cut-off values determined. ResultsA total of 446 animals with a median (interquartile range) age of 15 (10-20) years were recruited. Of these, 50.4% were mares and 49.6% were geldings. The most common breeds were Welsh (36.4%), Shetland (17.0%) and cob (9.4%). Overall, 72.2% of animals were overweight/obese (BCS 7-9/9), 27.3% were of ideal weight (BCS 4-6/9) and 0.5% were underweight (BCS 1-3/9). After 1, 2 and 3 years, respectively, 18 (4.0%), 30 (6.7%) and 44 (9.9%) animals were reported to have had laminitis. Plasma adiponectin, and serum basal (insulin) and (insulin) post-dexamethasone levels were significantly (P 0.05) associated with laminitis occurrence cumulatively after 1, 2 and 3 years. Use of the area under the ROC curves to distinguish animals that did and did not develop laminitis showed good (basal [insulin] after 1 year), fair (all others) or poor ([insulin] post-dexamethasone) levels of accuracy. Main limitationsAnimals were evaluated at a single time point and biomarkers were assayed using single assays. ConclusionsRisk factors for future laminitis prior to disease occurrence include low plasma adiponectin and high serum basal insulin or insulin post-dexamethasone concentrations.",129
"Child abuse includes all forms of physical and emotional ill treatment, sexual abuse, neglect, and exploitation that results in actual or potential harm to the child's health, development, or dignity. In Taiwan, the Child Protection Medical Service Demonstration Center (CPMSDC) was established to protect children from abuse and neglect. We further analyzed and compared the trends and clinical characteristics of cases reported by CPMSDC to evaluate the function of CPMSDC in approaching child abuse and neglect in Taiwan. We prospectively recorded children with reported child abuse and neglect in a CPMSDC in a tertiary medical center from 2014 to 2015. Furthermore, we analyzed and compared age, gender, scene, identifying settings, time of visits, injury type, injury severity, hospital admission, hospitalization duration, and outcomes based on the different types of abuse and the different settings in which the abuse or neglect were identified. Of 361 child abuse cases (mean age 4.8 +/- 5.36 years), the incidence was highest in 1- to 6-year-old children (n=198, 54.85%). Physical abuse and neglect were predominant in males, while sexual abuse was predominant in females (P<0.001). Neglect was most common (n=279, 75.85%), followed by physical (n=56, 15.51%) and sexual abuse (n=26, 7.2%). The most common identifying setting was the emergency department (n=320, 88.64%), with neglect being most commonly reported. Head, neck, and facial injuries were more common in physically abused children than in neglected and sexual abused children (P<0.005), leading to longer hospitalization (P=0.042) and a higher Injury Severity Score (P=0.043). There were more skin injuries in neglect (P<0.001). The mortality rate was 2.49% (n=9). The CPMSDC could enhance the ability, alertness, and inclination of professionals to identify suspected cases of child abuse, and to increase the rate of registry. Cases of physical abuse had a higher Injury Severity Score, longer duration of hospitalization, and more injuries of head, face, and neck compared with other types of abuse. The reported rate of neglect was highly elevated after the CPMSDC established during the study period. Recognition of neglect is not easy, but the consequent injury, especially asphyxia, may lead to mortality.",76
"Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) is an important crop of the Cucurbitaceae family in fruit production worldwide. During its production, bacterial fruit blotch (BFB) caused by Acidovorax citrulli (Acidovorax avenae subsp. citrulli) is an important limiting factor on the volume and value of crops. This pathogen is known as a seed-borne pathogen, and the infested seeds can be a primary source of inoculum. Hence, a rapid and sensitive method for detecting A. citrulli on seeds would be an important tool in the management of BFB. In this study, we sought to develop a method to detect A. citrulli bacterial cells based on a TaqMan probe-based insulated isothermal PCR (TiiPCR) assay. Firstly, the specific primers and probe were designed based on a specific DNA fragment from the genome of A. citrulli. Then, PCR amplification was performed with the plasmid DNA to adjust the components of the PCR reagents, such as the concentrations of primers, magnesium chloride, and Taq DNA polymerase. Results revealed that 10 copies of plasmid DNA were detectable within the modified reagents by TiiPCR. Moreover, 10 bacterial cells in each reaction tube were detectable at a 100 % detection rate in this condition with a fluorescent signal intensification over 1.8. Based on these results, we concluded that a specific, rapid, and sensitive method based on TiiPCR had been successfully developed to detect bacterial cells of A. citrulli.",37
"Barriers to access and long-term complications remain a challenge in transplantation. Further advancements may be achieved through research priority setting with patient engagement to strengthen its relevance. We evaluated research priority setting in solid organ transplantation and described stakeholder priorities. Databases were searched to October 2016. We synthesized the findings descriptively. The 28 studies (n = 2071 participants) addressed kidney [9 (32%)], heart [7 (25%)], liver [3 (11%)], lung [1 (4%)], pancreas [1 (4%)], and nonspecified organ transplantation [7 (25%)] using consensus conferences, expert panel meetings, workshops, surveys, focus groups, interviews, and the Delphi technique. Nine (32%) reported patient involvement. The 336 research priorities addressed the following: organ donation [43 priorities (14 studies)]; waitlisting and allocation [43 (10 studies)]; histocompatibility and immunology [31 (8 studies)]; immunosuppression [21 (10 studies)]; graft-related complications [38 (13 studies)]; recipient (non-graft-related) complications [86 (14 studies)]; reproduction [14 (1 study)], psychosocial and lifestyle [49 (7 studies)]; and disparities in access and outcomes [10 (4 studies)]. The priorities identified were broad but only one-third of initiatives engaged patients/caregivers, and details of the process were lacking. Setting research priorities in an explicit manner with patient involvement can guide investment toward the shared priorities of patients and health professionals.",130
"Background: Evidence from quantitative studies suggest that Tai Chi produces a variety of health-related benefits, but few qualitative studies have investigated how older adults perceive the benefit of Tai Chi. The objective of the current study was to qualitatively evaluate the perceived benefits of Tai Chi practice among community older population. Methods: This study was conducted with participants from a trial examining the effects of a 12-week Tai Chi training on ischemic stroke risk in community older adults (n = 170). A total of 20 participants were randomly selected from a convenience sample of participants who had completed 12-week Tai Chi training (n = 68) were interviewed regarding their perceived benefit on physical and mental health and whether Tai Chi exercise was suitable for the elderly. Results: All participants agreed that Tai Chi training could relax their body and make them comfortable. Most of them thought Tai Chi training could promote physical health, including relieving pain, enhancing digestion, strengthening immunity, enhancing energy and improving sleep quality, enhancing their mental and emotional state (e.g. improving mood and reducing anxiety, improving concentration and promoting interpersonal relationship). Most of participants also agreed that Tai Chi exercise was appropriate for community older people. Three primary themes emerged from content analysis: Improving physical health; Enhancing mental and emotional state; Conforming with the request of the elderly. Conclusion: The findings indicate that regular Tai Chi exercise may have positive benefits in terms of improved physical health and mental state among community elderly population, and may be useful and feasible body-mind exercise to community elderly population for its positive effects and advantages.",15

"Numerous studies have reported an association between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and human health. Often these relationships are influenced by environmental factor that varies spatially and/or temporally. To our knowledge, there are no studies in Canada that have considered energy generation and fuel sales as PM2.5 effects modifiers. Determining exposure and disease-specific risk factors over space and time is crucial for disease prevention and control. In this study, we evaluated the association of PM2.5 with diabetes, asthma, and High Blood Pressure (HBP) incidence in Canada. Then we explored the impact of the energy generation and fuel sales on association changes. We fit an age-period-cohort as the study design, and We applied an over-dispersed Poisson regression model to estimate the risk. We conducted a sensitivity analysis to explore the impact of variation in clean energy rates and fuel sales on outcomes changes. The study included 117 health regions in Canada between 2007 and 2014. Our findings showed strong association of PM2.5 with diabetes, asthma, and HBP incidence. A two-year increase of 10 mu g/m(3) in PM2.5 was associated with an increased risk of 534% (95% CI: 2.28%; 12.53%) in diabetes incidence, 2.24% (95% CI: 0.93%; 538%) in asthma incidence, and 8.29% (95% CI: 3.44%; 19.98%) in HBP incidence. Our sensitivity analysis findings suggest higher risks of diabetes, asthma and HBP incidence when there is low clean energy generation. On the other hand, we found lower risk when we considered high rate of clean energy generation. For example, considering only diabetes incidence, we found that the risk in health regions with low rates of clean electricity is approximately 700% higher than the risk in health regions with high rates of clean electricity. Furthermore, our analysis suggested that the risk in regions with low fuel sales is 66% lower than the risk is health regions with low rates of clean electricity. Our study provides support for the creation of effective environmental health public policies that take into account the risk factors present in Canadians health regions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

"For the analysis of protein-protein interactions and protein conformations, cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry (CXMS) has become an essential tool in recent years. A variety of cross-linking reagents are used to covalently link interacting amino acids to identify protein-binding partners. The spatial proximity of cross-linked amino add residues is used to elucidate structural models of protein complexes. The main challenges for mapping protein-protein interaction are low stoichiometry and low frequency of cross-linked peptides relative to unmodified linear peptides as well as accurate and efficient matches to corresponding peptide sequences with low false discovery rates for identifying the site of cross-link. We evaluate the current state of chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry applications with the special emphasis on the recent development of informatics data processing and analysis tools that help complexity of interpreting CXMS data.

"Background: Prior studies have suggested that inhibited temperament may be associated with an increased risk for developing anxiety or mood disorder, including bipolar disorder. However, the neurobiological basis for this increased risk is unknown. The aim of this study was to examine temperament in symptomatic and asymptomatic child offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (OBD) and to investigate whether inhibited temperament is associated with aberrant hippocampal volumes compared with healthy control (HC) youth. Methods: The OBD group consisted of 45 youth, 24 of whom had current psychiatric symptoms (OBD(+)s) and 21 without any psychiatric symptoms (OBD-s), and were compared with 24 HC youth. Temperament characteristics were measured by using the Revised Dimensions of Temperament Survey. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure hippocampal volumes. The association between temperament and hippocampal volumes was tested by using multiple regression analysis. Results: Compared with the OBD-s group, the OBD(+)s group had significantly more inhibited temperament traits, less flexibility, more negative mood, and less regular rhythm in their daily routines. In contrast, the OBD(-)s group was more likely to approach novel situations compared with OBD(+)s or HC groups. Within the OBD(+)s group, a more inhibited temperament was associated with smaller right hippocampal volumes. Conclusions: In this study, symptomatic OBD were characterized by an inhibited temperament that was inversely correlated with hippocampal volume. Additional longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether inverse correlations between hippocampal volume and inhibited temperament represent early markers of risk for later developing bipolar disorder.",115
"Apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) is one of the most widely spread Prunus species cultivated in the temperate zones and it is an important source of vitamins, sugars, and organic acids. Apricots also contain some phytochemicals that have beneficial effects on human metabolism. However, a little is known about the quality characteristics of important Moroccan local clones. The objective of this study is to evaluate the quality of twelve local clones and, therefore, to identify those that presenting important and interesting quality traits. Some quality parameters such as Soluble Solids content (SS), pH value, Total Acidity (TA) and the ratio (SS/TA) were evaluated and major carboxylic acid components of apricot fruits were detected and quantified. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to study correlation between fruit quality parameters and to evaluate maturity stage and clone effects which are considered as decisive factors in the quality of apricots fruits. The clones were analyzed during three maturity stages: semi-ripe (M1), commercially ripe (M2), and tree ripe (M3). The results showed that malic and citric acids were the predominant organic acids in all apricots. Among different maturity stages, it is found that malic acid ranged from 7.02 to 22.86 g/kg of fresh weights (FW) while citric acid varied from 6.36 to 23.28 g/kg FW. Quinic, fumaric, and ascorbic acids were also quantified in the apricot fruits. Significant levels of vitamin C ranged from 0.001 to 0.150 g/kg FW were detected in the analyzed apricots and a remarkable variation was observed in all quality parameters. Moreover, significant correlations were found between the variables pH, SS, SS/TA ratio and organic acids mainly citric and malic acids. A genetic diversity was found between apricots clones according to their quality characteristics. This variability can be an asset in the apricots sector development in the region of Marrakesh either for fresh consumption or their processing into different products. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"Cooperative relationships between groups are difficult because of the high human capability to differentiate between in-group vs. out-group members. This obstacle exists even when the groups can obtain benefits for themselves from cooperation with other groups (rational cooperation). Based on an interactionist approach, the authors propose that personal (individual differences) and situational (conflicts) factors contribute to rational intergroup cooperation. The authors conducted a preliminary correlational study (Study 1) and an experimental investigation (Study 2). In Study 1, the authors examined, with 105 participants, the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the Rational-Experiential Inventory (REI), measuring individual differences in information processing. In Study 2, the authors conducted an experimental investigation with 141 participants, testing the role of individual differences and conflict in intergroup rational cooperation. Findings of Study 1 showed that the scale has adequate psychometric properties. Results of Study 2 confirmed that the existence of both manipulated and perceived intergroup conflict reduces the magnitudes of the relationships between rational ability and rational cooperation. In addition, perceived intergroup conflict increased the magnitude of the links from experiential ability and experimental engagement to rational cooperation. Both individual differences and previous conflict have a role in predicting rational intergroup cooperation. According to the interactionist approach, personal and situational factors should be considered in the understanding of intergroup relationships.",61
"Problem: National occupational injury prevention goals often prioritize the reduction of serious injuries. This study analyzed whether this prioritization is credible in respect to lost-time injuries and short and long term work absence, and the implications this has for injury severity-based versus injury absence-based prevention approaches. Method: The data consisted of national and work-site specific injury and absence data from construction workers in Denmark, including workers from the Copenhagen Metro construction sites, during the period 2000-2001. Results and impact on industry and government: Absence length was significantly dependent on the type of injury. Sprains and strains were most prevalent and accounted for approximately one third of injuries and absence. Fractures accounted for one sixth of injuries and the greatest proportion of long-term absence. The results give credibility to the need for targeting sprains and strains in injury and absence prevention initiatives. (c) 2007 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",28
Wireless power transfer (WPT) or wireless energy transmission is the transmission of electrical power from a power source to a consuming device without using solid wires or conductors. In this paper we describe the implementation of the concept of wireless power transfer to transmit power from mobile phones to mobile phones. In our design we use simple inductive coupling and basic electrical circuits to implement this technology.,45
"Voltage is one of the most fundamental concepts in electrical engineering, but nevertheless has been shown to be a difficult concept for many students. To help address those difficulties, we designed a tutorial worksheet similar to those published by the Physics Education Group at the University of Washington. In this activity, students were introduced to electric potential and compared and contrasted it to voltage. As electric potential and Kirchhoff's Voltage Law are closely related, we assumed learning about potential would help students gain a better qualitative understanding of voltage. Post-test and exam data from an introductory circuits course show that after the tutorial many students still had difficulties with voltage and potential. More than three quarters of the responses concerning voltage and potential were inconsistent. This suggests that most students were unable to link those two concepts. We therefore conclude that potential and voltage remain conceptually very different for students in their learning process. As tutorial worksheets have proved to be very effective in students overcoming conceptual difficulties, it is likely that there are specific difficulties with these concepts that have not yet been identified.",47
"Autoantibodies of the IgG subclass are pathogenic in a number of autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythomatosus. The presence of circulating IgE autoantibodies in autoimmune patients has also been known for almost 40 years. Despite their role in allergies, IgE autoantibodies are not associated with a higher rate of atopy in these patients. However, recently they have been recognized as active drivers of autoimmunity through mechanisms involving the secretion of Type I interferons by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), the recruitment of basophils to lymph nodes, and the activation of adaptive immune responses through B and T cells. Here, we will review the formation, prevalence, affinity, and roles of the IgE autoantibodies that have been described in autoimmunity. We also present novel evidence supporting that triggering of IgE receptors in pDC induces LC3-associated phagocytosis, a cellular process also known as LAP that is associated with interferon responses. The activation of pDC with immune complexes formed by DNA-specific IgE antibodies also induce potent B-cell differentiation and plasma cell formation, which further define IgE's role in autoimmune humoral responses.",105
"The default mode network (DMN) has been identified reliably during rest, as well as during the performance of tasks such as episodic retrieval and future imagining. It remains unclear why this network is engaged across these seemingly distinct conditions, though many hypotheses have been proposed to account for these effects. Prior to generating hypotheses explaining common DMN involvement, the degree of commonality in the DMN across these conditions, within individuals, must be statistically determined to test whether or not the DMN is truly a unitary network, equally engaged across rest, retrieval and future imagining. To provide such a test, we used comparable paradigms (self-directed, uninterrupted thought of equal duration) across the three conditions (rest, retrieval, and future imagining) in a within-participant design. We found lower than expected pattern similarity in DMN functional connectivity across the three conditions. Similarity in connectivity accounted for only 40-50% of the total variance. Partial Least Squares (PLS) analyses revealed the medial temporal regions of the DMN were preferentially coupled with one another during episodic retrieval and future imagining, whereas the non-medial temporal regions of the DMN (e.g., medial prefrontal cortex, lateral temporal cortex, and temporal pole) were preferentially coupled during rest. These results suggest that DMN connectivity may be more flexible than previously considered. Our findings are in line with emerging evidence that the DMN is not a static network engaged commonly across distinct cognitive processes, but is instead a dynamic system, topographically changing in relation to ongoing cognitive demands.

"Mindfulness-based strategies show promise for targeting the construct of impulsivity and associated variables among problematic alcohol users. This study examined the moderating role of intervention (mindfulness vs relaxation vs control) on trait impulsivity and three outcomes examined post-intervention (negative affect, positive affect, and urge to drink) among 207 college students with levels of at risk drinking. Moderation analyses revealed that the relationship between baseline impulsivity and the primary outcomes significantly differed for participants who underwent the mindfulness versus relaxation interventions. Notably, simple slope analyses revealed that negative urgency was positively associated with urge to drink following the mindfulness intervention. Among participants who underwent the relaxation intervention, analysis of simple slopes revealed that negative urgency was negatively associated with urge to drink, while positive urgency was positively associated with positive affect following the relaxation intervention. Findings suggest that level (low vs high) and subscale of impulsivity matter with regard to how a participant will respond to a mindfulness versus relaxation intervention.

"The objective of this study was to provide fundamental parameters for the utilization of bamboo scrimber in the building structure field as a green building material. Both static tensile and compressive tests were conducted on bamboo scrimber, with 180 specimens for compressive tests and 173 specimens for tensile tests. The normal and lognormal distributions were selected to fit the experimental data. The design values were calculated according to the Chinese allowable stress design method and ASTM D2915 (2003). The results showed that both tensile strength (UTS) and compressive strength (CS) parallel to the fiber of bamboo scrimber were significantly higher than those of wood and other bamboo-based composite materials. Kolmogorov-Smirnov and chi-squared test results indicated that a lognormal distribution was a good fit for the UTS and CS except for the fitting result of UTS by the chi-squared test. The calculated design values of UTS and CS using ASTM D2915 (2003) were higher compared with those found using the Chinese allowable stress design method.",99
"Building construction is one of the largest final consumers of environmental resources as well as one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gas and other pollution. This paper aims to propose ecological indicators for green building construction by applying a slack-based data envelop analysis approach, in which resource conservation and environmental protection are both incorporated. We conduct an empirical analysis of ecological indicators for green building construction using China's regional panel dataset during 1995-2012, and use the analysis to further discuss the technological gaps across the regions. The findings show that: (i) half of China's provinces have a substantial potential increase of more than 60% in ecological performance for green building construction; (ii) the developed areas perform better than the developing areas; (iii) the 11th five-year plan period is a turning point for China's green building construction and development as the policies for green construction haye significant effects.

"Newtonian fluid dynamics simulations were performed using the Navier-Stokes-Fourier formulations to elucidate the short time-scale (mu s and longer) evolution of the density and temperature distributions in an argon-gas-filled attenuator for an X-ray free-electron laser under high-repetition-rate operation. Both hydrodynamic motions of the gas molecules and thermal conductions were included in a finite-volume calculation. It was found that the hydrodynamic wave motions play the primary role in creating a density depression (also known as a filament) by advectively transporting gas particles away from the X-ray laser-gas interaction region, where large pressure and temperature gradients have been built upon the initial energy deposition via X-ray photoelectric absorption and subsequent thermalization. Concurrent outward heat conduction tends to reduce the pressure in the filament core region, generating a counter gas flow to backfill the filament, but on an initially slower time scale. If the inter-pulse separation is sufficiently short so the filament cannot recover, the depth of the filament progressively increases as the trailing pulses remove additional gas particles. Since the rate of hydrodynamic removal decreases while the rate of heat conduction back flow increases as time elapses, the two competing mechanisms ultimately reach a dynamic balance, establishing a repeating pattern for each pulse cycle. By performing simulations at higher repetition rates but lower per pulse energies while maintaining a constant time-averaged power, the amplitude of the hydrodynamic motion per pulse becomes smaller, and the evolution of the temperature and density distributions approach asymptotically towards, as expected, those calculated for a continuous-wave input of the equivalent power.",69
"In this paper we present an FPGA implementation of 5/3 Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), which is used in image compression. The 5/3 lifting-based wavelet transform is modeled and simulated using MATLAB. DSP implementation methodologies are used to optimize the required hardware. The signal flow graph and dependence graph are derived and optimized to implement the hardware description of the circuit in Verilog. The circuit code then has been synthesized and realized using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) of FLEX10KE family. Post-synthesis simulations confirm the circuit operation and efficiency.",56
Wave energy converters generally suffer from a low operating power factor due to the nature of the long wavelength water wave and the inductance of the electrical generator employed in the conversion process. A Forced Commutated Series Capacitor (FCSC) converter can be connected between the generator and the load circuit to prevent power factor degradation. This paper describes the effectiveness of a new FCSC control strategy developed for operation at low and variable frequencies corresponding to the nature of the water waves. Simulation results show that the proposed symmetrical duty cycle control strategy is capable of maintaining almost unity power factor over the required frequency range.,52
"Psoriasis skin lesions are characterized by dramatic changes in the transcriptome, reflecting altered activity of multiple signalling pathways in resident and infiltrating cells. miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that have a large impact on cellular functions by regulating multiple genes simultaneously, and they have been shown to play key roles in skin homoeostasis and inflammation. In this commentary to the review article MicroRNAs in Psoriasis: Immunological Functions and Potential Biomarkers by Liu etal., the role of miRNAs in psoriasis and their diagnostic and therapeutic potential are discussed and remaining unanswered questions are highlighted.",21
"In this paper, a new identification method for large heterogeneous spatially interconnected systems is presented. A string of different systems in state-space representation is considered. The proposed algorithm optimizes the Output-Error of the global system by using the Steepest-Descent and the Gauss-Newton methods. The main contribution of this work is that both the Jacobian and the Hessian matrix can be entirely captured by using Sequentially Semi-Separable (SSS) matrices. Therefore, all the computations in the optimization routine can be performed with complexity that is linear in the number of subsystems. This fact permits to obtain models for large interconnected systems at low computational cost. Finally, a numerical example is presented in order to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",58
"Light has profound effects on mood regulation as exemplified in seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and the therapeutic benefits of light therapy. However, the underlying neural pathways through which light regulates mood are not well understood. Our previous work has developed the diurnal grass rat, Arvican-this niloticus, as an animal model of SAD. Following housing conditions of either 12:12 h dim light: dark (DLD) or 8:16 h short photoperiod (SP), which mimic the lower light intensity or short day-length of winter, respectively, grass rats exhibit an increase in depression-like behavior compared to those housed in a 12:12 h bright light:dark (BLD) condition. Furthermore, we have shown that the orexinergic system is involved in mediating the effects of light on mood and anxiety. To explore other potential neural substrates involved in the depressive phenotype, the present study examined hypothalamic dopaminergic (DA) and somatostatin (SST) neurons in the brains of grass rats housed in DLD, SP and BLD. Using immunostaining for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and SST, we found that the number of TH- and SST-ir cells in the hypothalamus was significantly lower in the DLD and SP groups compared to the BLD group. We also found that treating BLD animals with a selective orexin receptor 1 (OX1R) antagonist SB-334867 significantly reduced the number of hypothalamic TH-ir cells. The present study suggests that the hypothalamic DA neurons are sensitive to daytime light deficiency and are regulated by an orexinergic pathway. The results support the hypothesis that the orexinergic pathways mediate the effects of light on other neuronal systems that collectively contribute to light-dependent changes in the affective state.

"Background: Evidence linking prenatal exposure to outdoor air pollution with eczema in early childhood is scare, and the role of components of air pollution and exposure timing remains unclear. Objectives: We investigated the association between exposure to air pollution during preconceptional and perinatal period and the risk of eczema in preschool children. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of 2598 children aged 3-6 years in Changsha, China. The prevalence of eczema was assessed by a standardized health questionnaire administered by the parents. Individual exposures to nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <= 10 pm (PM10) during the 4th-6th and 1st-3rd month before pregnancy, entire pregnancy, and three trimesters were estimated by an inverse distance weighted (IDW) method based on concentrations measured at monitoring stations. Association between childhood eczema and exposure to air pollution was examined by logistic regression models in terms of odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for an interquartile range (IQR) increase in exposure. Results: Life-time prevalence of eczema in preschool children in Changsha was 28.6%. Childhood eczema was associated with traffic-related air pollutant NO2 during 3 months before pregnancy and entire pregnancy with adjusted ORs = 1.19 (95% CI: 1.04-1.37) and 1.21 (95% CI: 1.03-1.42) respectively. The highest risk of eczema was observed for the 1st trimester exposure to NO2 [OR = 1.26 (95% CI: 1.09-1.46)]. However, no association was detected for SO2 and Philio exposure during any window. High-level exposure to NO2 during the whole time period significantly increased the effect of NO2 in all windows on eczema risk as compared with low-level exposure. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the association between both preconceptional and perinatal exposure to NO2 and childhood eczema was consistent and robust, and this association was modified by some personal, parental hereditary and indoor environmental factors. Conclusion: Our findings support the hypothesis that early childhood eczema is associated with exposure to traffic-related air pollutant during both preconceptional and perinatal period, especially at a high level of exposure.

"The American College of Cardiology, Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, Society of Thoracic Surgeons, and American Association for Thoracic Surgery, along with key specialty and subspecialty societies, have completed a 2-part revision of the appropriate use criteria (AUC) for coronary revascularization. In prior coronary revascularization AUC documents, indications for revascularization in acute coronary syndromes and stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) were combined into 1 document. To address the expanding clinical indications for coronary revascularization, and to align the subject matter with the most current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, the new AUC for coronary artery revascularization were separated into 2 documents addressing SIHD and acute coronary syndromes individually. This document presents the AUC for SIHD. Clinical scenarios were developed to mimic patient presentations encountered in everyday practice. These scenarios included information on symptom status; risk level as assessed by noninvasive testing; coronary disease burden; and, in some scenarios, fractional flow reserve testing, presence or absence of diabetes, and SYNTAX score. This update provides a reassessment of clinical scenarios that the writing group felt were affected by significant changes in the medical literature or gaps from prior criteria. The methodology used in this update is similar to the initial document but employs the recent modifications in the methods for developing AUC, most notably, alterations in the nomenclature for appropriate use categorization. A separate, independent rating panel scored the clinical scenarios on a scale of 1 to 9. Scores of 7 to 9 indicate that revascularization is considered appropriate for the clinical scenario presented. Scores of 1 to 3 indicate that revascularization is considered rarely appropriate for the clinical scenario, whereas scores in the mid-range of 4 to 6 indicate that coronary revascularization may be appropriate for the clinical scenario. As seen with the prior coronary revascularization AUC, revascularization in clinical scenarios with high symptom burden, high-risk features, and high coronary disease burden, as well as in patients receiving antianginal therapy, are deemed appropriate. Additionally, scenarios assessing the appropriateness of revascularization before kidney transplantation or transcatheter valve therapy are now rated. The primary objective of the AUC is to provide a framework for the assessment of practice patterns that will hopefully improve physician decision making.",120
"Selenium (Se) is an essential nutrient for antioxidant defenses in fish because of its role in preventing immunosuppression caused by oxidative stress. In this study it was demonstrated the relation between the oxidative stress and immune status after a long Se supplementation period, as a result of the evaluation of immunological, hematological and antioxidant responses, as well as growth performance of pacu fed diets supplemented with different concentrations of organic selenium (0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, and 1.8 mg Se-yeast/kg, but the final analyzed selenium concentrations were 0.72, 0.94, 1.15, 1.57 and 2.51 mg/kg, respectively) for 65 days. Dietary Se supplementation at 1.15 mg Se-yeast/kg (analyzed value) restored the production of antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione S-transferase (GST)), and consequently allowed the increased of some immunological parameters (leukocyte respiratory burst activity and lysozyme activity), hematological parameters (red blood cell count (RBC), hematocrit (HTC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and white blood cell count (WBC)). Se supplementation in pacu diets at 1.15 mg Se-yeast/kg for 65 days improved immune response and antioxidant defenses, suggesting that oxidative stress impairs immune system response to prevent excessive reactive oxygen species in cells and indicating the occurrence of a physiological trade-off between immune and antioxidant systems. Higher Se levels, such as 1.57 mg Se-yeast/kg increased the leukocyte respiratory burst activity, the WBC and thrombocyte counts, the RBC and HTC, and the GST and GPx enzymes. However, 2.51 mg Se-yeast/kg decreased the lysozyme levels, the WBC and thrombocyte counts, the RBC, HTC and MCV, and the GST and GPx enzymes. Those findings are important to future studies because showed the negative effect of oxidative stress on immunity, and may help to prevent any inhibition of the expected immune response after immunomodulators administration and vaccination. Also it was possible to meet the dietary selenium requirement of pacu, that was estimated to be 1.56 mg/kg. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",33
"Existing adaptive educational hypermedia systems have been using learning resources sequencing approaches in order to enrich the learning experience. In this context, educational resources, either expository or evaluative, play a central role. However, there is a lack of tools that support sequencing essentially due to the fact that existing specifications are complex. This paper presents Seqins as a sequencing tool of digital educational resources. Seqins includes a simple and flexible sequencing model that will foster heterogeneous students to learn at different rhythms. The tool communicates through the IMS Learning Tools Interoperability specification with a plethora of e-learning systems such as learning management systems, repositories, authoring and automatic evaluation systems. In order to validate Seqins we integrate it in an e-learning Ensemble framework instance for the computer programming learning domain.",40
"A major cause of fatal construction accidents is falls from height (FFH). In this study, the Human Factor Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) was adopted and modified to assist in classifying the root causes of fatal FFH accidents in Hong Kong. The characteristics and root causes of the accidents were analyzed using frequency analysis. The associations among the causes were examined using Fisher's exact test and latent class analysis (LCA). The cases apparently share some common characteristics and certain HFACS factors are closely associated. According to LCA results, the factors in all the cases may be placed into four classes, named as ill planning, violation, hidden hazards created by others, and incapable staffing. Recommendations are made to reduce FFH construction accidents based on the characteristics and root causes. The paper contributes to the body of knowledge in construction management by developing a modified HFACS framework for extracting structured information from construction accident reports, finding the general characteristics and managerial causes behind the FFH accidents, and using LCA to identify the connections among the managerial causes.",102
"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and concussion are terms often used interchangeably. However, mTBI is frequently seen as representing a broader injury that encompasses the construct of concussion, which often conveys transience or decreased severity. The present study examined the influence of varying diagnostic terminology on acute injury expectations in an undergraduate population (N=105). Participants were presented with an mTBI vignette and were randomly assigned to one of two conditions in which the term mTBI or concussion was used to describe the injury. There were no significant differences between the two conditions on anxiety, symptomatology, timeline, or consequence scales. However, participants in the mTBI group allocated more days to return to play than participants in the concussion group, suggesting that terminology has an effect on perceptions of the severity of the injury. Varsity athletes allocated fewer days to return to play than nonathletes. Individuals with a history of concussion, both athletes and nonathletes, indicated fewer days to return to play, but greater symptomatology than individuals with no history of concussion. Clinicians should consider the influence of diagnostic terminology, athletic background, and history of concussion on perceptions of the severity of an injury because expectations can influence injury outcomes and compliance in a recovery process.",108
"Objective: To revise conversion disorder scale and to establish the psychometric properties of the revised scale. Methods: This case-control study was conducted from February to June, 2014, at the Government College University, Lahore, Pakistan, and comprised schoolchildren and children with conversion disorder. In order to generate items for revised version of conversion disorder scale, seven practising mental health professionals were consulted. A list of 42 items was finalised for expert ratings. After empirical validation, a scale of 40 items was administered on the participants and factor analysis was conducted. Results: Of the 240 participants, 120(50%) were schoolchildren (controls group) and 120(50%) were children with conversion disorder (clinical group). The results of factor analysis revealed five factors (swallowing and speech symptoms, motor symptoms, sensory symptoms, weakness and fatigue, and mixed symptoms) and retention of all 40 items of revised version of conversion disorder scale. Concurrent validity of the revised scale was found to be 0.81 which was significantly high. Similarly, discriminant validity of the scale was also high as both clinical and control groups had significant difference (p<0.001) in scores. Cronbach's alpha of scale was alpha=0.91 while item total correlation ranged from 0.50 to 0.80. The sensitivity and specificity analysis indicated that the revised conversion disorder scale was 76% sensitive to predicting conversion disorder while specificity showed that the scale was 73% accurate in specifying participants of the control group. Conclusion: The revised version of conversion disorder scale was a reliable and valid tool to be used for screening of children with conversion disorder.",125
"Craving has been considered one of the core features of addiction. It can be defined as the urge or conscious desire to use a drug elicited by the drug itself, drug-associated cues or stressors. Craving plays a major role in relapse, even after prolonged periods of abstinence, as well as in the maintenance of drug seeking in non-abstinent addicts. The circuitry of craving includes medial parts of the prefrontal cortex, ventral striatal zones, ventral tegmental area, ventral pallidum, and limbic regions. Interestingly, the cerebellum shows reciprocal loops with many of these areas. The cerebellum has been linked traditionally to motor functions but increasing evidence indicates that this part of the brain is also involved in functions related to cognition, prediction, learning, and memory. Moreover, the functional neuroimaging studies that have addressed the study of craving in humans repeatedly demonstrate cerebellar activation when craving is elicited by the presentation of drug-related cues. However, the role of cerebellar activity in these craving episodes remains unknown. Therefore, the main goal of this review is to provide a brief update on craving studies and the traditional neural basis of this phenomenon, and then discuss and propose a hypothesis for the function of the cerebellum in craving episodes.

"The demand for infrared transmitting materials has grown steadily for several decades as markets realize new applications for longer wavelength sensing and imaging. With this growth has come the demand for new and challenging material requirements that cannot be satisfied with crystalline products alone. Chalcogenide materials, with their unique physical, thermal, and optical properties, have found acceptance by designers and fabricators to meet these demands. No material is perfect in every regard, and chalcogenides are no exception. A cause for concern has been the relatively low fracture toughness and the propensity of the bulk material to fracture. This condition is amplified when traditional subtractive manufacturing processes are employed. This form of processing leaves behind micro fractures and sub surface damage, which act as propagation points for both local and catastrophic failure of the material. Precision lens molding is not a subtractive process, and as a result, micro fractures and sub surface damage are not created. This results in a stronger component than one produced by traditional methods. New processing methods have also been identified that result in an even stronger surface that is more resistant to breakage, without the need for post processing techniques that may compromise surface integrity. This paper will discuss results achieved in the process of lens molding development at Edmund Optics that result in measurably stronger chalcogenide components. Various metrics will be examined and data will be presented that quantifies component strength for different manufacturing processes.Acute limb ischemia is one of the most common peripheral arterial disease, while surgical restoration of blood flow often results in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Our previous study revealed the inflammation intensity in arterial tissue, characterized by expression of high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1), was contrary to the fluctuation of hemodynamics in reperfusion limbs in a rat model. This study meant to clarify the role of HMGB1 during this process. Laser Doppler perfusion imaging evaluated limb hemodynamics in mean and max perfusion unit (PU). Femoral arterial tissue was collected for molecular biology examination. The results revealed that HMGB1 promoted vascular structure remodeling and vasomotor dysfunction during acute I/R, characterized by degradation of collagenous fibers, disruption of elastic lamellae, intensive inflammation and phenotype transfer of smooth muscle cells. Blockade of HMGB1 preserved vascular homeostasis and improved PUs (P-meanPU < 0.001, P-maxPU < 0.001). The elevated expression of TNF-alpha, IL-6, ICAM, VCAM, MMP-2, MMP-9, alpha-SM actin correlated with HMGB1 positively. In conclusion, HMGB1 promoted vascular remodeling and dysfunction via initiating an inflammation cascade during I/R. Blockade of HMGB1 would preserve vascular homeostasis and facilitate the blood perfusion of ischemic limb. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",29
"Patients with schizophrenia show specific abnormalities in visual perception, and patients with bipolar disorder may have related perceptual deficits. During tasks that highlight perceptual dysfunction, patients with schizophrenia show abnormal activity in visual brain areas, including the lateral occipital complex (LOC) and early retinotopic cortex. It is unclear whether the anatomical structure of those visual areas is atypical in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In members of those two patient groups and healthy controls, we localized LOC and early retinotopic cortex individually for each participant using functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), then measured the thickness of those regions of interest using structural MRI scans. In both regions, patients with schizophrenia had the thinnest cortex, controls had the thickest cortex, and bipolar patients had intermediate cortical thickness. A control region, motor cortex, did not show this pattern of group differences. The thickness of each visual region of interest was significantly correlated with performance on a visual object masking task, but only in schizophrenia patients. These findings suggest an anatomical substrate for visual processing abnormalities that have been found with both neural and behavioral measures in schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses.",72
"BACKGROUND: Anaphylaxis diagnostic criteria were proposed at the Second Symposium on the Definition and Management of Anaphylaxis. These criteria were 97% sensitive and 82% specific when retrospectively validated. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (NIAID/FAAN) criteria for diagnosis of anaphylaxis in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study of patients seen in our institution's ED from April 2010 to March 2013. Patients seeking care for an allergic reaction and possible anaphylaxis were enrolled. Patients and providers completed questionnaires regarding onset, trigger, and signs and symptoms. Records were reviewed independently and blindly by 2 board-certified allergist-immunologists, and their final diagnosis (anaphylaxis vs no anaphylaxis) was used as the reference standard. Two-by-two tables were built, and test characteristics were calculated. RESULTS: Among the 174 enrolled patients, 91 (52%) met the NIAID/FAAN criteria for anaphylaxis. The allergist-immunologists diagnosed 61 cases of anaphylaxis (35%), of which 58 (95%) also satisfied the NIAID/FAAN criteria. The interrater agreement between allergist-immunologists was substantial (k = 0.7). Test characteristics (95% CIs) of the NIAID/FAAN criteria were as follows: sensitivity, 95.1% (85.4%-98.7%); specificity, 70.8% (61.4%-78.8%); positive predictive value, 63.7% (52.9%-73.4%); negative predictive value, 96.4% (89.1%-99.1%); positive likelihood ratio, 3.26; and negative likelihood ratio, 0.07. CONCLUSIONS: Prospectively, the NIAID/FAAN criteria continued to be highly sensitive (95%) but had lower specificity (71%) than on retrospective assessment. These criteria are likely to be useful for the diagnosis of anaphylaxis in the ED. (C) 2016 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology",33
"Structural health monitoring of large multispan flexible bridges is particularly important because of their important role in civil infrastructure and transportation systems. In this study, the response of the Yokohama Bay Bridge (YBB), a three-span cable-stayed bridge, to the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake is used to perform multi-input multi-output system identification studies. The extensive multicomponent measurements are also used to develop and validate data-driven nonlinear mathematical models that can predict the response of YBB to various earthquake records and can accurately estimate its damping characteristics when the system is driven into the nonlinear response range. A combination of least-square (parametric) and neural network (nonparametric) approaches is used to develop the mathematical models, along with time-marching techniques for dynamic response calculations. It is shown that the nonlinear mathematical models perform better than the equivalent linear models, both for response prediction and damping estimation. The importance of having an accurate approach for quantifying the damping due to the variety of nonlinear features in the YBB response is shown. This study demonstrates the significance of constructing robust mathematical models that can capture the correct physics of the underlying system and that can be used for computational purposes to augment experimental studies. Given the lack of suitable data sets for full-scale structures under extreme loads, the availability of the long-duration measurements from the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and its many strong aftershocks provides an excellent opportunity to perform the analyses presented in this study.

"Optimal productivity is the highest sustainable productivity level achievable under good management and typical working conditions. Accordingly, optimal productivity provides the foundation for determining the absolute efficiency of construction operations because an accurate estimate of optimal productivity enables the comparison between actual versus optimal rather than actual versus historical productivity. This research contributes to the current body of knowledge by introducing a two-prong strategy for estimating optimal productivity in labor-intensive construction operations and by applying this strategy to a pilot study on the replacement of electrical lighting fixtures. The first prong, or top-down approach, estimates the upper limit of optimal productivity by introducing system inefficiencies into the productivity frontier-the productivity achieved under perfect conditions. This study uses a qualitative factor model to identify this upper limit. The second prong, or bottom-up approach, estimates the lower limit of optimal productivity by taking away operational inefficiencies from actual productivity-productivity recorded in the field. A discrete-event simulation model provides this lower-limit value. An average of the upper and lower limits yields the best estimate of optimal productivity. This paper reviews relevant literature, presents the details of both the top-down and bottom-up approaches, analyzes the data from a pilot project, evaluates the feasibility of this two-prong strategy, and finally provides a novel framework for project managers who want to accurately estimate the optimal productivity of their labor-intensive construction operations.

"Sustainable water management may strongly benefit from an integrated approach. Additionally, an integrated urban water management policy considering the various urban water flows and the possible interactions between the water sector and the remaining urban activities can benefit if based on an urban metabolism based analysis. This article assesses water flows of Lisbon Metropolitan Area considering the conventional water supply system and wastewater treatment system flows and also the hydrological cycle flows, and proposes a global set of indicators to perform a benchmarking analysis of the 18 municipalities of the region. Results highlighted the heterogeneous nature of the Metropolitan area in terms of water management - either in terms of management entities (predominantly public or municipalized), water consumption (varying from 227.4l/hab.day in Palmela to 402.7l/hab.day in Seixal), wastewater treatment (10 out of 18 municipalities already undergo secondary or tertiary wastewater treatments), runoff indices (depending on the municipality's level of urbanization), among other. Through the output volumes it was also assessed the potential of the municipalities to reuse wastewater for potable or non-potable urban uses, as well as the potential to harvest and harness rainwater. The main constraints to an integrated water management were identified and some potential solutions were measured and proposed even though they need further assessment, particularly in a cost-benefit perspective.

"The building industry is associated with several environmental impacts. In considering the total building lifecycle, the use phase has a strong influence on the level of impact. According to the literature, the use phase of residential buildings represents up to 92% of energy consumption, constitutes 95% of water consumption (indoor and outdoor), accounts for 45% of the weight of materials used, and produces 50% of the waste (maintenance, repair, and renovation). Green building and certification programs used in North America, such as BOMA-BESt (R), LEED (R), and Living Building Challenge (TM), aim to reduce the environmental footprint of housing. However, while these certifications provide a useful framework for practices related to buildings and their systems, a documentary analysis shows that they do not adequately take into account the use phase of residential buildings. The purpose of this paper is to show that consideration of the use phase is inconsistent with the impacts associated with it.",99
"Background: Bright-light intervention is reported to successfully treat depression, in particular seasonal affective disorder, but the neural pathways and molecular mechanisms mediating its effects are unclear. An amygdala-prefrontal cortex corticolimbic circuit regulates responses to salient environmental stimuli (e.g., threat) and may underlie these effects. Serotonin signaling modulates this circuit and is implicated in the pathophysiology of seasonal and other affective disorders. Methods: We evaluated the effects of a bright-light intervention protocol on threat-related corticolimbic reactivity and functional coupling, assessed with an emotional faces functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm at preintervention and postintervention. In a double-blind study conducted in the winter, 30 healthy male subjects received bright-light intervention (dose range between participants:.1-11.0 kilolux) for 30 minutes daily over a period of 3 weeks. Additionally, we considered serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) genotype status as a model for differences in serotonin signaling and moderator of intervention effects. Results: Bright-light dose significantly negatively affected threat-related amygdala and prefrontal reactivity in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, amygdala-prefrontal and intraprefrontal functional coupling increased significantly in a dose-dependent manner. Genotype status significantly moderated bright-light intervention effects on intraprefrontal functional coupling. Conclusions: This is the first study to evaluate the effects of clinically relevant bright-light intervention on threat-related brain function. We show that amygdala-prefrontal reactivity and communication are significantly affected by bright-light intervention, an effect partly moderated by genotype. These novel findings support that this threat-related corticolimbic circuit is sensitive to light intervention and may mediate the therapeutic effects of bright-light intervention.",71
"Migraine is a brain disorder characterized by a piercing headache which affects one side of the head, located mainly at the temples and in the area around the eye. Migraine imparts substantial suffering to the family in addition to the sufferer, particularly as it affects three times more women than men and is most prevalent between the ages of 25 and 45, the years of child rearing. Migraine typically occurs in individuals with a genetic predisposition and is aggravated by specific environmental triggers. Attempts to study the biochemistry of migraine began as early as the 1960s and were primarily directed at serotonin metabolism after an increase of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), the main metabolite of serotonin was observed in urine of migraineurs. Genetic and biochemical studies have primarily focused on the neurotransmitter serotonin, considering receptor binding, transport and synthesis of serotonin and have investigated serotonergic mediators including enzymes, receptors as well as intermediary metabolites. These studies have been mainly assayed in blood, CSF and urine as the most accessible fluids. More recently PET imaging technology integrated with a metabolomics and a systems biology platform are being applied to study serotonergic biology. The general trend observed is that migraine patients have alterations of neurotransmitter metabolism detected in biological fluids with different biochemistry from controls, however the interpretation of the biological significance of these peripheral changes is unresolved. In this review we present the biology of the serotonergic system and metabolic routes for serotonin and discuss results of biochemical studies with regard to alterations in serotonin in brain, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, platelets, plasma and urine of migraine patients.",4
"ObjectiveThe differential diagnosis of bipolar illness vs. borderline personality is controversial. Both conditions manifest impulsive behavior, unstable interpersonal relationships, and mood symptoms. This study examines whether and which mood clinical features can differentiate between both conditions. MethodA total of 260 patients (mean standard deviation age 41 13 years, 68% female) attending to a mood clinic were examined for diagnosis of bipolar illness and borderline personality disorder using SCID-I, SCID-II, and clinical mood criteria extracted from Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ). They were analyzed using diagnoses as dependent variables. Predictors of bipolar and borderline diagnoses were identified by multivariable logistic regressions, and predictive validity of models was assessed using ROC curve analysis. ResultsBipolar illness was strongly predicted by elevated mood (OR = 4.02, 95% CI: 1.80-9.15), increased goal-directed activities (OR = 3.90, 95% CI: 1.73-8.96), and episodicity of mood symptoms (OR = 3.48, 95% CI 1.49-8.39). This triad model predicted bipolar illness with 88.7% sensitivity, 81.4% specificity, and obtained an auROC of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.76-0.96) and a positive predictive value of 85.1%. For borderline personality disorder, only female gender was a statistically significant predictor (OR = 3.41, 95% CI: 1.29-13.7), and the predictive model obtained an auROC of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.53-0.74). ConclusionIn a mood disorder clinic setting, manic criteria and episodic mood course distinguished bipolar illness from borderline personality disorder.",70
"The synthesis and characterisation of a partially substituted calix[4]jarene, namely, 5,11,17,23-tetra-tertbuty1,25,27-bis[aminoethoxy] 26,28-dihydroxycalix[4]arene are reported. Its interaction with commonly used pharmaceuticals (clofibric acid, diclofenac and aspirin) was investigated by spectroscopic (H-1 NMR and UV), electrochemical (conductance measurements) and thermal (titration calorimetry) techniques. It is concluded on the basis of the experimental work and molecular simulation studies that the receptor interacts selectively with these drugs. Preliminary studies on the selective extraction of these pharmaceuticals from water by the calix receptor are reported and the potential for a carrier mediated sensor based on this ligand for 'on site' monitoring of pharmaceuticals is discussed.

"Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are ubiquitous enzymes in animals and plants, and they are multifunctional proteins encoded by a large gene family. GSTs are involved in response to the oxidative stress including drought, salt, heavy metals, and so on. Under oxidative stress, the excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce an increase in GST levels, and then the GSTs metabolize the toxic products of lipid peroxidation, damaged DNA and other molecules. Previously, a full-length cDNA of a novel zeta GST gene, PpGST, was characterized from fruit of Pyrus pyrifolia Nakai cv. Huobali. In the present study, a constitutive plant expression vector of PpGST was constructed and transferred into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv Xanthi) to verify the function of PpGST. As a result, the PpGST gene was successfully integrated into the genome of the transgenic tobacco lines and expressed as expected in the transformants through Southern blotting and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) analysis. Growth of T1 generation plants of PpGST transgenic lines and WT under non-stressful conditions was similar, however, the transgenic tobacco lines showed relatively normal growth under drought, NaCl, and cadmium (Cd) stresses. Furthermore, the T1 transgenic tobacco lines showed significantly slower superoxide anion production rate than the WT under abiotic stress. Simultaneously, the MDA content of each T1 transgenic tobacco plant was only slightly increased and significantly lower than that of the WT under drought, salt and Cd stress. Together with the GST activity of the transgenic tobacco lines, which was significantly increased under stressful conditions, as compared with that in WT, overexpression of PpGST in tobacco enhanced the tolerance of transgenic tobacco lines to oxidative damage caused by drought, NaCl, and Cd stresses.",39
"Objectives The incarceration rate in the United States has increased rapidly since the mid-1970s and, accordingly, a large number of children are exposed to parental incarceration. Research finds that parental incarceration is associated with deleterious physical and mental health outcomes among children, but little is known about these children's health care access. Methods I used data from the 2011-2012 National Survey of Children's Health (N = 95,531), a population-based and nationally representative survey of non-institutionalized children ages 0-17 in the United States, to estimate the association between exposure to parental incarceration and children's unmet health care needs. Results In logistic regression models that adjust for an array of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, children exposed to parental incarceration, compared to their counterparts, have 1.26 (95% CI 1.02-1.54) times the odds of having any unmet health care need. Analyses that disaggregate by type of unmet health care need (mental, dental, vision, mental health, or other) suggest this association is driven by a greater likelihood of unmet mental health care needs (OR 1.60; 95% CI 1.04-2.46). Conclusions Children exposed to parental incarceration, a vulnerable group especially at risk of physical and mental health problems, face challenges to health care access, especially mental health care access. Given that parental incarceration is concentrated among those children most in need of health care, parental incarceration may exacerbate existing inequalities in unmet health care needs.",117
"No clinically important pharmacokinetic interference of alendronate occurred between a new effervescent formulation of alendronate and levothyroxine when coadministered. The combination does not materially affect levothyroxine absorption. Concurrent treatment of osteoporosis with alendronate (Aln) and hypothyroidism with levothyroxine (LT4) may be problematic because both drugs are to be taken separately after fasting overnight. The primary objective was to assess pharmacokinetic interactions between a new effervescent formulation of Aln (Aln-NEF) and LT4. A randomized, open-label, 3-way crossover study was conducted in 30 healthy adults (15 women). Subjects were dosed 3 times, separated by 35 days, after overnight fasts, with Aln-NEF alone (70 mg), LT4 alone (600 mu g), or Aln-NEF and LT4 concurrently. Samples were analyzed for plasma Aln and serum LT4. Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction was assessed using 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the test/reference ratio of the geometric means for area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to last measureable time point (AUC(0-t) ) and maximum concentration (C (max)). Results were compared to the default no-effect boundaries of 80 to 125% for the ratio Aln-NEF and LT4 concurrently/Aln-NEF alone and the ratio Aln-NEF and LT4 concurrently/LT4 alone. Geometric mean ratios (Aln-NEF with LT4/Aln-NEF alone) were 0.927 (90% CI 0.795-1.081) for AUC(0-8) and 0.912 (90% CI 0.773-1.077) for C (max), demonstrating LT4 does not appreciably affect the pharmacokinetics of Aln. Geometric mean ratios (LT4 with Aln-NEF/LT4 alone) were 1.049 (90% CI 0.983-1.119) for AUC(0-48) and 1.075 (90% CI 1.006-1.148) for C (max), demonstrating LT4 is bioequivalent between the 2 treatments. Coadministration of Aln-NEF and LT4 was well tolerated. There was no clinically important pharmacokinetic interference between the Aln-NEF formulation and LT4. Aln-NEF does not materially affect LT4 absorption.",133
"While over-indebtedness has emerged as a new social risk among Europeans as a consequence of economic recessions, its associations with health and disability are poorly understood. This study utilises longitudinal, register-based data to assess the associations of over-indebtedness with disability retirement. Severely over-indebted people were identified from the Finnish credit information register. For each over-indebted person, one matched control was retrieved from the population register (total N: 54,494). Register data on socio-demographics, health-related factors and pensions were used to analyse the incidence of disability pensions due to different diagnoses among over-indebted people and their controls during the period 1995-2009 using Cox regression analysis. The analyses showed that over-indebtedness was strongly associated with the risk of disability retirement in all diagnostic groups. The associations were stronger among women than among men. The adverse effects of over-indebtedness on health and disability should be acknowledged. In addition to standard socio-demographic indicators, debtor status may add to our knowledge of the predictors of poor health. Policymakers should adopt measures to prevent over-indebtedness and to overcome its harmful effects.",115
"An effective method based on measuring the fiber orientation of yarn floats with two-dimensional Fourier transform (2-D FFT) is proposed to recognize the weave pattern of yarn-dyed fabric in the high-resolution image. The recognition process consists of four main steps: 1. High-resolution image reduction, 2.Fabric image skew correction, 3.Yarn floats localization, 4. Yarn floats classification. Firstly, the high-resolution image is reduced by the nearest interpolation algorithm. Secondly, the skew of the fabric image is corrected based on Hough transform. Thirdly, the yarn floats in the fabric image is localized by the yarns segmentation method based on the mathematical statistics of sub-images. Fourthly, the high-resolution image is corrected and its yarns are segmented successively according to the inspection information of the reduced image. The fiber orientations are detected by 2-D FFT, and the yarn floats are classified by k-means clustering algorithm. Experimental results and discussions demonstrate that, by measuring the fiber orientation of yarn floats, the proposed method is effective to recognize the yarn floats and the weave pattern for yarn-dyed, solid color, and gray fabrics.",0
"Solid thermal finite element model of suspension bridge main cable was established by finite element software ANSYS. Layered grid was divided along the radial direction of main cable. Main cable thermal parameters, including heat conductivity coefficient, specific heat, thermal expansion coefficient were fitting with least square method. Three-dimensional transient temperature field of main cable was simulatd based on the thermal parameter fitting results. Main girder and tower of the suspension were made up of beam element. Solid thermal model of main cable was connected with suspension bridge for that degree of freedom of main cable was consistent with that of main girder and tower. This model can accurately simulate the uneven temperature field of main cable under fire scenario and calculate elastic modulus, tensile strength under high temperature.",97
"The aim of this study was to investigate the factorial structure and psychometric properties of the Separation Anxiety Assessment Scale (SAAS) with Spanish schoolchildren. The participants in Study 1 were 1281 children aged 8-11. Exploratory factor analysis identified four factors: worry about calamitous events, fear of abandonment, fear of being alone, and fear of physical illness, which explained 47.77 % of the variance. The participants of Study 2 were 4628 schoolchildren aged 8-11. The four related factors model was validated by confirmatory factor analysis. The internal consistency (alpha = .84) and temporal stability (r = .77) were good. The convergent validity was evident from the pattern of correlations with the measures of separation anxiety, sensitivity to anxiety and school fears. The sensitivity of the scale was 83 %, and its specificity, 93 %. The complementary subscales predicted the diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder. The results support the reliability, validity and clinical utility of the SAAS.",108
"The tumor microenvironment consists of an immunosuppressive niche created by the complex interactions between cancer cells and surrounding stromal cells. A critical component of this environment are myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), a heterogeneous group of immature myeloid cells arrested at different stages of differentiation and expanded in response to a variety of tumor factors. MDSCs exert diverse effects in modulating the interactions between immune effector cells and the malignant cells. An increased presence of MDSCs is associated with tumor progression, poorer outcomes, and decreased effectiveness of immunotherapeutic strategies. In this article, we will review our current understanding of the mechanisms that underlie MDSC expansion and their immune-suppressive function. Finally, we review the preclinical studies and clinical trials that have attempted to target MDSCs, in order to improve responses to cancer therapies.",33
"The paper presents the formalism of the parametric integral equation system (PIES) for two-dimensional elastoplastic problems and the algorithm for its numerical solution. The efficiency of the proposed approach lies in the global modeling of a plastic zone, without classic discretization into elements, using surface patches popular in computer graphics. Lagrange polynomials with various number and arrangement of interpolation nodes are used to approximate plastic strains. Three test examples are solved and the obtained results are compared with analytical and numerical solutions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",79
"Aims and objectivesTo examine the cost-effectiveness of semi-rigid ankle brace to facilitate return to work following first-time acute ankle sprains. DesignEconomic evaluation based on cost-utility analysis. BackgroundAnkle sprains are a source of morbidity and absenteeism from work, accounting for 15-20% of all sports injuries. Semi-rigid ankle brace and taping are functional treatment interventions used by Musculoskeletal Physiotherapists and Nurses to facilitate return to work following acute ankle sprains. MethodsA decision model analysis, based on cost-utility analysis from the perspective of National Health Service was used. The primary outcomes measure was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, based on quality-adjusted life years. Costs and quality of life data were derived from published literature, while model clinical probabilities were sourced from Musculoskeletal Physiotherapists. ResultsThe cost and quality adjusted life years gained using semi-rigid ankle brace was 184 and 0.72 respectively. However, the cost and quality adjusted life years gained following taping was 155 and 0.61 respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the semi-rigid brace was 263 pound per quality adjusted life year. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that ankle brace provided the highest net-benefit, hence the preferred option. ConclusionTaping is a cheaper intervention compared with ankle brace to facilitate return to work following first-time ankle sprains. However, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio observed for ankle brace was less than the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence threshold and the intervention had a higher net-benefit, suggesting that it is a cost-effective intervention. Decision-makers may be willing to pay 263 pound for an additional gain in quality adjusted life year. Relevance to clinical practiceThe findings of this economic evaluation provide justification for the use of semi-rigid ankle brace by Musculoskeletal Physiotherapists and Nurses to facilitate return to work in individuals with first-time ankle sprains.",27
"The Rogers-Ramanujan identities and various analogous identities (Gordon, Andrews-Bressoud, Capparelli, etc.) form a family of very deep identities concerned with integer partitions. These identities (written in generating function form) are typically of the form ""product side"" equals ""sum side,"" with the product side enumerating partitions obeying certain congruence conditions and the sum side obeying certain initial conditions and difference conditions (along with possibly other restrictions). We use symbolic computation to generate various such sum sides and then use Euler's algorithm to see which of them actually do produce elegant conjectured product sides. We not only rediscover many of the known identities but also discover some apparently new ones, as conjectures supported by strong mathematical evidence.",24
"ObjectivesTo investigate the gene expression profile of human gingiva following surgical wounding. MethodsTen volunteers had one side of the palate wounded. Five days later, biopsies were harvested from both wounded (healing gingiva) and contra-lateral site (normal gingiva). Tissue samples were processed for gene expression (RNA-Seq, real-time PCR) and immunohistochemistry. Gene set enrichment/pathway analysis was also performed. ResultsSeven hundred genes were significantly differentially expressed in healing gingiva. Among genes with >twofold change (FC) in expression, 399 genes were up-regulated and 88 down-regulated, several not previously reported expressed in gingiva. Most increased in expression (30-FC) were MMP1, CCL18, SPP1, MUC21, CTHRC1, MMP10, and SERPINE1; most decreased (7-FC) were COCH, SIAH3, MT4, IGFL3, KY, and SYT16. Real-time PCR confirmed significantly changed mRNA levels for selective genes tested. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed several significantly enriched biological pathways. Immunohistochemistry confirmed protein expression of MUC21, CTHRC1, CTGF, and SYT16 in normal and healing gingiva. ConclusionsThis first comprehensive analysis of the human gingival transcriptome during surgical wound healing offers novel insights into the participating molecular and biological mechanisms. The present results could serve as basis for future investigations into gingival wound healing following surgical, traumatic, or other type of injury.",37
"The flood protection methods can affect the erosion process of dam-breaking which determines the volume of failure and dam final profile. This article focuses on the experimental models with different protection methods for dam-breaking flood by overtopping. The experiments were conducted in a rectangular tank with an erodible barrier dam made from cohesive sand, including five flood protection methods: diversion trench at the side wall, diversion trench in the middle, wire box, cement protection and geotextile waterproof, to observe and investigate erosion processes. The different water heads between reservoir and downstream of dam over time changing contribute to various inner destructive mechanisms and erosion processes in three directions (vertical, horizontal and backward), which resulted in different erosion volumes. The initial dam-breaking erosion process of barrier dam is related with evacuation of people in downstream area and the final erosion volume is bound up with coverage area of flood as well as the extent of damage. Therefore, we concentrate on the analysis of the initial developmental process and the total erosion value. The results show that the wire box, cement protection and geotextile waterproof can effectively retard the growing larger volume of flood and the diversion trench in the middle can cause the largest erosion volume of dam body. And the erosion processes are determined by the interaction of erosion abilities in three directions. Also, the estimates are presented of the retrogressive erosion velocity, transverse broadening velocity, vertical incision velocity.",93
"We propose a differential versioning based data storage (DiVers) architecture for distributed storage systems, which relies on a novel erasure coding technique that exploits sparsity across versions. The emphasis of this work is to demonstrate how sparsity exploiting codes (SEC), originally designed for I/O optimization, can be extended to significantly reduce storage overhead in a repository of versioned data. In addition to facilitating reduced storage, we address some key reliability aspects for DiVers such as (i) mechanisms to deploy the coding technique with arbitrarily varying size of data across versions, and (ii) investigating the right allocation strategy for the encoded blocks over a network of distributed nodes across different versions so as to achieve the best fault tolerance. We also discuss system issues related to the management of data structures for accessing and manipulating the files over the differential versions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",41
"Background. Oxytetracycline (OTC), which is largely employed in zootechnical and veterinary practices to ensure wellness of farmed animals, is partially absorbed within the gastrointestinal tract depositing in several tissues. Therefore, the potential OTC toxicity is relevant when considering the putative risk derived by the entry and accumulation of such drug in human and pet food chain supply. Despite scientific literature highlights several OTC-dependent toxic effects on human and animal health, the molecular mechanisms of such toxicity are still poorly understood. Methods. Here, we evaluated DNA damages and epigenetic alterations by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, chromatin immuno-precipitation and Western blot analysis. Results. We observed that human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) expressed DNA damage features (activation of ATM and p53, phosphorylation of H2AX and modifications of histone H3 rnethylation of lysine K4 in the chromatin) after the in vitro exposure to OTC. These changes are linked to a robust inflammatory response indicated by an increased expression of Interferon (IFN)-gamma and type 1 superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Discussion. Our data reveal an unexpected biological in vitro activity of OTC able to modify DNA and chromatin in cultured human PI3MC. In this regard, OTC presence in foods of animal origin could represent a potential risk for both the human and animal health.",37
"This paper describes the concept on conversion of the movement of a float in a wave power plant, characterize by high force and low speed energy, to a high speed and low force energy in linear machine by using gas springs. In a wave power plant the float is moving slowly. The buoyancy force on the float from the raising wave and the gravitational force on the float when the wave is sinking are enormous. This enormous force combined with the movement presents much concentrated energy. A linear electric generator which converts this low speed high force ocean wave energy into electrical energy by direct conversion i.e. piston in the generator is moving in the same way as the float, will not be cost effective due to its large size and expensive. The concept of converting slow movement (low frequency) of the ocean energy to a faster movement (high frequency) to reduce the size of generator by using double gas spring is presented.",52
"This paper uses a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, an adaptive weighted PSO (AWPSO) algorithm, and a genetic algorithm (GA) to determine the optimal proportional-integral-derivative controller's parameters of a hydraulic position control system. A typical hydraulic servo system has been selected as an application. The mathematical model of this hydraulic servo system which comprises the most relevant dynamics and nonlinear effects is considered. The model simulates the behavior of a REXROTH servo valve and includes the nonlinearities of friction forces, valve dynamics, oil compressibility, and load influence. The performance indices, which have been used in the optimization process, are integral absolute error, integral square error and integral time absolute error. The proposed controller is implemented on the simulation model to identify the best method for tuning the controller. Compared with GA and AWPSO results, the PSO method has been found to be more efficient and robust in improving the step response of a position control for hydraulic systems in terms of settling time, maximum overshoot and undershoot.",59
"Oral feeding intolerance (OFI) is a common complication in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP). Variations in blood glucose are associated with impaired gastrointestinal function but, to date, measures of glucose variability have not been investigated to predict OFI in patients with AP. To investigate the usefulness of several glucose variability measures in predicting the occurrence of OFI early in the course of AP. In this prospective cohort study, six measures of glucose variability were calculated prior to the occurrence of OFI. Multivariate binary logistic regression analyses were conducted, and the diagnostic performance and accuracy of glucose variability measures were assessed. Of the 95 prospectively enrolled patients, 21 (22%) developed OFI. After adjusting for confounders, admission blood glucose concentration and mean blood glucose concentration were significantly associated with OFI [odds ratio 1.49 (95% confidence interval 1.01-2.20) and odds ratio 1.67 (95% confidence interval 1.07-2.61), respectively]. Both admission blood glucose and mean blood glucose had an area under the curve of 0.83 and positive likelihood ratios of 6.45 and 10.19, respectively. Blood glucose concentration before refeeding, standard deviation of blood glucose concentration, coefficient of variation, and mean amplitude of glycemic excursions were not significantly associated with OFI. In-hospital blood glucose concentrations are associated with subsequent development of OFI in patients with AP. In particular, admission blood glucose and mean blood glucose could be useful predictors of OFI in this setting.",120
"Controlling microbial activity is a primary concern during the management of the large volumes of wastewater (produced water) generated during high-volume hydraulic fracturing. In this study we analyzed the transcriptional activity (metatranscriptomes) of three produced water samples from the Marcellus Shale. The goal of this study was to describe active metabolic pathways of industrial concern for produced water management and reuse, and to improve understanding of produced water microbial activity. Metatranscriptome analysis revealed active biofilm formation, sulfide production, and stress management mechanisms of the produced water microbial communities. Biofilm-formation and sulfate-reduction pathways were identified in all samples. Genes related to a diverse array of stress response mechanisms were also identified with implications for biocide efficacy. Additionally, active expression of a methanogenesis pathway was identified in a sample of produced water collected prior to holding pond storage. The active microbial community identified by metatranscriptome analysis was markedly different than the community composition as identified by 16S rRNA sequencing, highlighting the value of evaluating the active microbial fraction during assessments of produced water biofouling potential and evaluation of biocide application strategies. These results indicate biofouling and corrosive microbial processes are active in produced water and should be taken into consideration while designing produced water reuse strategies.",29
"In China, the number of the power station increases quickly. According to the information from the Internet, From 2001 to August 2005, State Environmental Protection Administration has approved 472 thermal power projects, and the installed capacity is as much as 344382MW. In which, 135 thermal power projects are approved in 2001, the installed capacity is as much as 107590MW, 207% more than last year; 213 thermal power projects are approved From January to August in 2005, the installed capacity is as much as 168546MW, 420% more than last year. If these power stations all come online, Chinese installed capacity will be as much as 5.82 billion KW, 145% more than 2000. In December 2006, the growth of the power stations keeps high levels. The same month, the whole country's generating capacity was 2266 billion kilowatt-hour, 15.5% more than last year. As the rise of the winter electricity consumption, the generating capacity of power projects increased quickly. The genearating capacity of power projects in December was 10.9% more than last month. From January to December in 2006 the whole country's generating capacity was 23009 billion kilowatt-hour, 15.08% more than last year. From January to October in 2007 the whole country's generating capacity was 21756 billion kilowatt-hour, 16.04% more than last year. The generating capacity in August had the largest number, which was 2390 billion kilowatt-hour, 10.19% more than last year.",35
"Graphene and graphene-like two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted much attention due to its extraordinary electronic and optical properties, which accommodate a large potential In optoelectronic applications such as photodetection. However, although much progress has been made, many challenges exist in fundamental and practical aspects hindering graphene and graphene-like 2D materials from photodetector and other photonic and optoelectronic applications. Here, we review the recent progress in photodetection based on graphene and graphene-like 2D materials and start with the summary of some most important physical mechanisms, including photoelectric, photo-thermoelectric, and photo-bolometric regimes. Then methodology-level discussions are given from viewpoints of state-of-the-art designs in device geometry and materials. It is worth emphasizing that emerging photodetection and photodetectors based on graphene-like 2D materials such as metal chalcogenide nanosheets are reviewed systematically. Finally, we conclude this review in a brief discussion with remaining challenges in photodetection of two-dimensional photonics and optoelectronics (2D POE) and note that complete understandings of 2D materials and 2D POE may inspire solar energy conversion and other new applications.",89
"The advancement of World Wide Web has revolutionized the way the manufacturers can do business. The manufacturers can collect customer preferences for products and product features from their sales and other product-related Web sites to enter and sustain in the global market. For example, the manufactures can make intelligent use of these customer preference data to decide on which products should be selected for targeted marketing. However, the selected products must attract as many customers as possible to increase the possibility of selling more than their respective competitors. This paper addresses this kind of product selection problem. That is, given a database of existing products P from the competitors, a set of company's own products Q, a dataset C of customer preferences and a positive integer k, we want to find k-most promising products (k-MPP) from Q with maximum expected number of total customers for targeted marketing. We model k-MPP query and propose an algorithmic framework for processing such query and its variants. Our framework utilizes grid-based data partitioning scheme and parallel computing techniques to realize k-MPP query. The effectiveness and efficiency of the framework are demonstrated by conducting extensive experiments with real and synthetic datasets.",101
"With urging needs to decrease the fuel consumption and environment pollution, energy saving and emission reduction technologies in the ICE (internal combustion engine) industry are developed. A thermal OS/ORC (Oil Storage/Organic Rankine Cycle) system was constructed and preliminarily tested for WHR (Waste Heat Recovery) from exhaust gas of a 240 kW diesel engine. The heat balance test of diesel engine without OS/ORC was conducted first to investigate the varying property of exhaust gas, then the OS/ORC system was tested to show its ability against high temperature and variation of exhaust gas. The results show that thermal oil effectively dropped the working temperature of organic fluid to less than 210 degrees C, which is much lower than the decomposition temperature of many organic fluids. Also, thermal oil brought a significant inertia to the response of system which could be positive against the variation of engine condition. In order to learn more about the operating characteristics of OS/ORC system, the impact of important parameters on each other was investigated quantitatively as well as on the performance of OS/ORC system. The results show that within the given range, higher evaporating pressure can obviously improve the performance of OS/ORC while the impact of superheat is nearly negligible. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Significant progress has been made in understanding the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis. It is widely recognized that early institution of treatment is one of the best predictive factors for response to therapy. Several novel approaches are currently being investigated and several novel biologics are in various stages of development. With advances in the fields of proteomics, genomics, and metabolomics, specific phenotypes of the disease can be better identified and specific therapies for particular phases of the disease and specific patients will allow for improved control of this condition.",23
"A systematic non-probabilistic reliability analysis procedure for structural vibration active control system with unknown-but-bounded parameters is proposed. The state-space representation of active vibration control system with uncertain parameters is presented. Compared with the robust control theory, which is always over-conservative, the reliability-based analysis method is more suitable to deal with uncertain problem. Stability is the core of the closed-loop feedback control system design, so stability criterion is adopted to act as the limited state function for reliability analysis. The uncertain parameters without enough samples are modeled as interval variables. Interval perturbation method is employed to estimate the interval bounds of eigenvalues, which can be used to characterize the stability of the closed-loop active control system. Formulation of defining the reliability of active control system based on stability is discussed. A novel non-probabilistic reliability measurement index is discussed and used to determine the probability of the stability based on the area ratio. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated by two numerical examples. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",58
"Synthetic binding proteins are constructed using nonantibody molecular scaffolds. Over the last two decades, in-depth structural and functional analyses of synthetic binding proteins have improved combinatorial library designs and selection strategies, which have resulted in potent platforms that consistently generate binding proteins to diverse targets with affinity and specificity that rival those of antibodies. Favorable attributes of synthetic binding proteins, such as small size, freedom from disulfide bond formation and ease of making fusion proteins, have enabled their unique applications in protein science, cell biology and beyond. Here, we review recent studies that illustrate how synthetic binding proteins are powerful probes that can directly link structure and function, often leading to new mechanistic insights. We propose that synthetic proteins will become powerful standard tools in diverse areas of protein science, biotechnology and medicine.",31
"Ruxolitinib is a selective and potent inhibitor of Janus kinase (JAR) 1 and JAK2. It is approved for the treatment of patients with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis, or those with polycythemia vera who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea. To investigate its carcinogenic potential, ruxolitinib was administered by oral gavage once daily to Tg.rasH2 mice for 6 months at doses of 15, 45 or 125 mg/kg/day, and to Sprague-Dawley (Crl:CD) rats for 2 years at 10, 20 or 60 mg/kg/day. Ruxolitinib had no effect on survival, and did not increase the incidence of any neoplastic findings in either species. Exposure (AUC) was similar to or exceeded that associated with therapeutic use. Lymphoid depletion and a decrease in extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen occurred in rats, which were attributed to the pharmacologic activity of ruxolitinib. In Tg.rasH2 mice, increased inflammation in the nasal cavity was observed. Dose-dependent decreases in a number of spontaneous neoplastic/preneoplastic lesions were observed in rats, including mammary tumors in females, adrenal pheochromocytomas in males, hepatocellular adenomas/carcinomas in males, and hepatic basophilic (males and females) and eosinophilic (males) foci. Peribiliary fibrosis was also decreased. Clear cell foci in the liver were increased in females. Based on the results of these studies, ruxolitinib is not considered to be carcinogenic.

"Dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) SDH rings have been extensively deployed in core networks and metropolitan area networks (MAN). Furthermore, advances in optical ADM (OADM), optical DXC (OXC) and Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA) have resulted in evolving core networks and MAN to all-optical networks. Due to its low cost, flexibility and low loss, OADM based on fiber grating and optical circulator has exhibited potential in applying to DWDM SDH ring networks[l]. Although fiber-grating based OADM has the feature of low loss, EDFA is always deployed to compensate the loss and further improve the network performances. However, amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise will limit the improvement of the network performances[2]. Fiber grating is a stable and reliable filter, and this high performance filter is ideal for simultaneously achieving wide-band signal transmission and a high-level of ASE noise suppression in amplified DWDM networks. In this article, performance analysis of amplified DWDM SDH ring with OADM based on fiber grating and optical circulator has been performed with an explicit method -Signal Flow Graph. The results show that the throughput and the power penalty of amplified DWDM SDH ring with fiber-grating based OADM are effectively improved, considering ASE suppression by fiber gratings. Additionally, the network performances of pre-amplifying, post-amplifying and in-line amplifying schemes are analyzed, implying that the network performance optimization of amplified DWDM SDH ring with fiber-grating based OADM could be achieved with proper scheme.",56
"The analysis of the penalized Stokes problem, in its variable viscosity formulation, coupled to convection-diffusion equations is presented in this article. It models the interaction between a highly viscous fluid with variable viscosity and immersed moving and deformable obstacles. Indeed, while it is quite common to couple Poisson equations to diffusion-transport equations in plasma physics or fluid dynamics in vorticity formulations, the study of complex fluids requires to consider together the Stokes problem in complex moving geometry and convection-diffusion equations. The main result of this paper shows the existence and the uniqueness of the solution to this equations system with regularity estimates. Then we show that the solution to the penalized problem weakly converges toward the solution to the physical problem. Numerical simulations of fluid mechanics computations in this context are also presented in order to illustrate the practical aspects of such models: lung cells and their surrounding heterogeneous fluid, and porous media flows. Among the main original aspects in the present study, one can highlight the non linear dynamics induced by the coupling, and the tracking of the time-dependence of the domain.",86
"Background/Aims: Sexual differences in the transcript levels of various genes including the hepatic isoforms of cytochrome P450 have been extensively studied. Expression of these sexual dimorphic genes have been quantified by Northern blotting, nuclear run on assays and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods using numerous housekeeping genes to normalize results. Earlier reports apparently assumed that these internal controls were sex-independent. We have studied sex differences in the expression levels of seven different commonly used housekeeping genes. Methods: We have used quantitative and semiquantitative RT-PCR to monitor the levels of hepatic mRNAs in intact and hypophysectomized male and female rats. Results: We have observed sex-dependent expression of the commonly used housekeeping genes tubulin, cyclophilin, tyrosine aminotransferase, beta-actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 18S and one unconventional housekeeping gene, that is, hypoxia inducing factor-1 alpha, in the livers of intact male and female rats. With the exception of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and 18S which were female-predominant (P < 0.01), the five other genes were found to be expressed at significantly (P < 0.01) higher concentrations in the livers of intact male rats. Similar to findings in which hypophysectomy eliminates sexual dimorphisms in cytochromes P450 expression, of the five housekeeping genes examined, cylophilin, tyrosine aminotransferase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, beta-actin, and 18S, all lost their sex-dependent expression following pituitary ablation. Conclusionds: Our data suggest that expression levels of these commonly measured housekeeping genes (structural and metabolic) are not constant, but rather are directly or indirectly regulated by sex-dependent hormones, compromising their application as normalizing controls.

"Forensic toxicology deals with the evaluation of plasma concentrations of foreign substances in the human body. Administered doses are estimated and blood concentrations at the time of the offence are evaluated, for example. Genetically caused changes of metabolizing enzymes (pharmacogenetics) as well as induction or inhibition of enzymes involved (pharmacokinetics) can affect plasma concentrations and should be taken into account in the assessment. While specialist literature can be consulted in the daily routine, expert witnesses are expected to answer corresponding questions immediately when questioned in court. This paper presents an overview of important pharmaceutical drugs and illegal drugs including their degradation pathways and well-known polymorphisms. Beyond that, the possibility of potential interactions is assessed and further presented in a chart for practical use in foro.",32
"In this paper the space variable-order fractional Schrodinger equation (VOFSE) is studied numerically, where the variable-order fractional derivative is described here in the sense of the quantum Riesz-Feller definition. The proposed numerical method is the weighted average non-standard finite difference method (WANSFDM). Special attention is given to study the stability analysis and the convergence of the proposed method. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to show that this method is reliable and computationally efficient.",80
"Cyclic stability is a key factor in the design of thermochemical heat storage systems. Because carbon dioxide (CO2) may react with heat storage materials and lead to a decrease in energy storage efficiency, the effect of CO2 on Ca(OH)(2)/CaO and Mg(OH)(2)/MgO systems is investigated in this study. The experimental results show that CO2 reacts with CaO in the water vapor that appears during the heat release process. Therefore, in the design of Ca(OH)(2)/CaO systems, CO2 should be cleared from the system. The results from Mg(OH)(2)/MgO systems show that CO2 only slightly reacts with MgO and Mg(OH)(2) during heat storage and release processes. This study indicates that carbonic acid (H2CO3) could easily react with CaO/Ca(OH)(2) to form CaCO3 during heat release processes. Generally, the remaining CO2 reduces the reversibility of Ca(OH)(2)/CaO systems but has only a slight influence on Mg(OH)(2)/MgO systems. In addition, the experimental results show that carbonate shell does not exist in rehydration for both of the CaO/MgO samples, but the influence of CO2 on the entire process increases after each cycle.

"Purpose: The prevalence of intimacy and substance use among adolescents and young adults during cancer therapy has not been well described. Methods: The ""Resilience in Adolescents and Young Adults with Cancer"" study was a prospective, multicenter, mixed-methods cohort study. English-speaking patients 14-25 years old with newly diagnosed cancer were invited to complete a comprehensive survey at the time of enrollment (T1) and 3-6 months later (T2). Intimate relationships and health behaviors were assessed with questions adapted from the Guidelines for Adolescent Preventative Services assessment. Descriptive statistics characterized the prevalence of sexual and substance-related behaviors at each time point. Results: Of 42 eligible and enrolled participants, 35 (83%) and 25 (59%) completed T1 and T2 surveys, respectively. Their mean age was 17.6 years (standard deviation 2.3), 57% were male, and the most common diagnoses were sarcoma and acute leukemia. Over a third of participants reported dating at each time point; 26% were sexually active at T1, and 32% at T2. Of those endorsing sexual activity, fewer than half reported consistent birth control or condom use and 4 reported their first sexual intercourse during our observation. In addition, 46% (T1) and 44% (T2) reported alcohol use and 23% (T1) and 26% (T2) reported illicit drug use. Despite these activities, fewer than 10% endorsed a worry or need to discuss these behaviors with oncology providers. Conclusions: Intimacy and substance use among adolescents and young adults are common during cancer therapy. Clinical and research implications include the identification of optimal communication and patient-centered supports. (C) 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.",116
"The brain-gut axis comprises the interactions of the brain with the spinal cord, the sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric divisions of the autonomic innervation of the digestive tract and the intestinal microbiome with its metabolites. This bidirectional communication enables an effective treatment method for functional gastrointestinal disorders (irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia), namely, gut-directed hypnosis. A series of randomized controlled studies show remarkable long-term success even with therapy-refractory complaints. Gut-directed hypnosis is therefore recommended to be included in guidelines for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. It can be performed in individual or group settings in 10 sessions and can be well integrated into a treatment concept in gastroenterological centers as well. There are also indications for efficacy in children with functional bowel diseases. Preliminary studies indicate that hypnosis may have an additive therapy effect over conventional medical treatment in inflammatory bowel diseases.",4
"This article presents the automatic generation control of an unequal three area thermal system. Single stage reheat turbines and generation rate constraints of 3%/min are considered in each control area. Controllers such as Integral (I), Proportional - Integral (PI), Proportional - Integral- Derivative (PID), and Proportional - Integral - Derivative Plus Second Order Derivative.(PID + DD) are treated as secondary controllers separately. A nature inspired optimization technique called Ant Lion Optimizer (ALO) algorithm is used for simultaneous optimization of the controller gains. Comparison of dynamic responses of frequencies and tie line powers corresponding to ALO optimized I, PI, PID and PID + DD controller reveal the better performance of PID + DD controller in terms of lesser settling time, peak overshoots as well as reduced oscillations. Robustness of the optimum gains of best controller obtained at nominal conditions is evaluated using sensitivity analysis. Analysis exposed that the optimum PID + DD controller gains obtained at nominal are robust and not necessary to reset again for changes in loading, parameter like inertia constant (H), size and position of disturbance. Furthermore, the performance of PID + DD controller is found better as compared to PID controller against random loading pattern condition. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",59
This paper deals with the design of a controller possessing tracking capability of any realisable reference trajectory while rejecting measurement noise. We consider discrete-time-varying multi-input multi-output stable linear systems and a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. A novel recursive algorithm estimating the time-varying PID gains is proposed. The development of the proposed algorithm is based on minimising a stochastic performance index. The implementation of the proposed algorithm is described and boundedness of trajectories and convergence characteristics are presented for a discretised continuous-time model. Simulation results are included to illustrate the performance capabilities of the proposed algorithm.,59
"Objective: Evidence-based therapies for borderline personality disorder (BPD) are lengthy and scarce. Data on brief interventions are limited, and their role in the treatment of BPD is unclear. Our aim was therefore to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of brief dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) skills training as an adjunctive intervention for high suicide risk in patients with BPD. Method: Eighty-four out-patients were randomized to 20 weeks of DBT skills (n = 42) or a waitlist (WL; n = 42). The primary outcome was frequency of suicidal or non-suicidal self-injurious (NSSI) episodes. Assessments were conducted at baseline 10, 20 and 32 weeks. Results: DBT participants showed greater reductions than the WL participants on suicidal and NSSI behaviours between baseline and 32 weeks (P < 0.0001). DBT participants showed greater improvements than controls on measures of anger, distress tolerance and emotion regulation at 32 weeks. Conclusions: This abbreviated intervention is a viable option that may be a useful adjunctive intervention for the treatment of high-risk behaviour associated with the acute phase of BPD.",70
"Computer-aided design (CAD) models of thin-walled parts, such as sheet metal or plastic parts, are often represented by their corresponding midsurfaces for computer-aided engineering (CAE) analysis. The reason being, 2D surface elements, such as ""shell"" elements, which need to be placed on the midsurface, provide fairly accurate results, while requiring far lesser computational resources time compared to the analysis using 3D solid elements. Existing approachesof midsurface computation are not reliable and robust. They result in ill-connected midsurfaces having missing patches, gaps, overlaps, etc. These errors need to be corrected, mostly by a manual and time-consuming process, requiring from hours to even days. Thus, an automatic and robust technique for computation of a well-connected midsurface is the need of the hour. This paper proposes an approachwhich, instead of working on the complex final solid shape, typically represented by B-rep (boundary representation), leverages feature information available in the modern CAD models for techniques such as defeaturing, generalization, and decomposition. Here, first, the model is defeaturedby removing irrelevant features, generating a simplified shape called ""gross shape"". The remaining features are then generalizedto their corresponding generic loft-feature equivalents. The model is then decomposed into sub-volumes, called ""cells"" having respective owner loft features. A graph is populated, with the cells at the graph nodes. The nodes are classified into midsurface patch-generating nodes (called 'solid cells' or sCells) and interaction-resolving nodes (called 'interface cells' or iCells). Using owner loft feature's parameters, sCells compute their own midsurface patches. Using a generic logic, the patches then get connected appropriately in the iCells, resulting in a well-connected midsurface. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated by computing well-connected midsurfaces of various real-life sheet metal parts.",82
"The potential harmful effects of media violence have been studied systematically and extensively. However, very little attention has been devoted to the intrigue and struggles between people depicted in the mass media. A longitudinal randomized experimental group-control group, pretest posttest design study was conducted to examine the potential effects of this type of TV series on young adults. A typical and popular TV series was select as a stimulus. By scrutinizing the outline of this TV series and inspired by studies of the effects of media violence, one behavioral observation and five scales were adopted as dependent measures. The study did not find any effect of the intrigue TV series on any of the six dependent variables. Finally, possible interference variables or moderators were discussed.",74
"The present study investigates the relationship between violent false memories and delinquent and aggressive behavior in a sample of adolescents. Two hundred eleven participants completed measures of aggressive and delinquent behavior and performed a modified version of the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm, a false memory task for lists of associated words. Participants were presented with a list of ambiguously violent words and three lists of neutral words. For each list a free recall task was performed. Violent false memories were significantly associated with delinquent behaviors in both genders, whereas a significant correlation with aggressive behaviors was found only in males. A multilevel multiple regression showed that the prediction of delinquent behaviors was improved by entering violent false memories into the model as a further predictor, whereas no effect was found for aggressive behaviors. These findings indicate a significant association of violent false memories with delinquent behavior in adolescents. (C) 2014 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

"Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by intense pruritis and is a common childhood inflammatory disease. Many factors are known to affect AD development, including the pleiotropic cytokine IL-4. Yet little is known regarding the direct effects of IL-4 on keratinocyte function. Objective and Methods: In this report RNA sequencing and functional assays were used to define the effect of the allergic environment on primary keratinocyte function and wound repair in mice. Results: Acute or chronic stimulation by IL-4 modified expression of more than 1000 genes expressed in human keratinocytes that are involved in a broad spectrum of nonoverlapping functions. Among the IL-4-induced changes, repression of fibronectin critically impaired the human keratinocyte wound response. Moreover, in mouse models of spontaneous and induced AD-like lesions, there was delayed re-epithelialization. Importantly, topical treatment with fibronectin restored the epidermal repair response. Conclusion: Keratinocyte gene expression is critically shaped by IL-4, altering cell fate decisions, which are likely important for the clinical manifestations and pathology of allergic skin disease.",110
"Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) require substantial support to address the core symptoms of ASD and co-occurring behavioral/developmental conditions. This study explores the early diagnostic experiences of school-aged children with ASD using survey data from a large probability-based national sample. Multivariate linear regressions were used to examine age when parent reported developmental concern to doctor, received ASD diagnosis, and first obtained services. Children whose parents had concerns about their child's verbal communication reported earlier ages for all outcomes when compared to children of parents who did not have verbal communication concerns. Children whose parents had concerns about their child's nonverbal communication or unusual gestures/ movements received an earlier diagnosis than children whose parents did not have these specific concerns.",64
"Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) as an infectious disease that has nine genotypes (A-I) and a 'putative' genotype J. Objectives: The aim of this study was to identify the rare codon clusters (RCC) in the HBV genome and to evaluate these RCCs in the HBV proteins structure. Methods: For detection of protein family accession numbers (Pfam) in HBV proteins, the UniProt database and Pfam search tool were used. Protein family accession numbers is a comprehensive and accurate collection of protein domains and families. It contains annotation of each family in the form of textual descriptions, links to other resources and literature references. Genome projects have used P famex tensively for large-scale functional annotation of genomic data; Pfam database is a large collection of protein families, each represented by multiple sequence alignments and hidden Markov models (HMMs). The Pfam search tools are databases that identify Pfam of proteins. These Pfam IDs were analyzed in Sherlocc program and the location of RCCs in HBV genome and proteins were detected and reported as translated EMBL nucleotide sequence data library (TrEMBL) entries. The TrEMBL is a computer-annotated supplement of SWISS-PROT that contains all the translations of European molecular biology laboratory (EMBL) nucleotide sequence entries not yet integrated in SWISS-PROT. Furthermore, the structures of TrEMBL entries proteins were studied in the PDB database and 3D structures of the HBV proteins and locations of RCCs were visualized and studied using Swiss PDB Viewer software (R). Results: The Pfam search tool found nine protein families in three frames. Results of Pfams studies in the Sherlocc program showed that this program has not identified RCCs in the external core antigen (PF08290) and truncated HBeAg gene (PF08290) of HBV. By contrast, the RCCs were identified in gene of hepatitis core antigen (PF00906 and the residues 224-234 and 251-255), large envelope protein S (PF00695 and the residues 53-56 and 70-84), X protein (PF00739 and the residues 10-24, 29-83, 95-99. 122-129, 139-143), DNA polymerase (viral) N-terminal domain (PF00242 and the residues 59-62, 214-217, 407-413) and protein P (Pf00336 and the residues 225-228). In HBV genome, seven RCCs were identified in the gene area of hepatitis core antigen, large envelope protein S andDNApolymerase, while protein structures of TrEMBL entries sequences found in Sherlocc program outputs were not complete. Conclusions: Based on the location of detected RCCs in the structure of HBV proteins, it was found that these RCCs may have a critical role in correct folding of HBV proteins and can be considered as drug targets. The results of this study provide new and deep perspectives about structure of HBV proteins for further researches and designing new drugs for treatment of HBV.",30
"This paper presents a new four inputs and one output voltage-mode universal filter using single-ended operational transconductance amplifiers (OTAs) and grounded capacitors. By appropriately connecting the input terminals, the proposed circuit can provide low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, band-stop and all-pass voltage responses. The filter also offers an orthogonal control of the natural frequency and the quality factor by adjusting the biasing currents of OTAs. The performances of the proposed filter are simulated with PSPICE to confirm the presented theory.",52
"Health risks from drinking rainwater are relatively small in the developing world context, but action is needed to ensure water safety. Water safety plans (WSPs) use an approach to manage water quality that has shown signs of success with public and communal water supplies, but relatively little research has been done to investigate the application of WSPs to self-supply systems. The aim of this paper is to investigate the primary issues surrounding appropriate water quality management of domestic rainwater harvesting (DRWH) systems in Fiji and consider how the principles of WSPs can be applied in this context. A qualitative research design was followed, utilising semi-structured interviews with 34 rural households and six key informants, sanitary inspections of DRWH systems and thematic data analysis. A number of challenges, including limited government resources and the limited knowledge and casual attitudes of rural rainwater consumers, constrain the practicality of adopting conventional WSPs at the household level, but steps for improvement can be taken.",95
"This research presents a study of the design and constructionof afertilizer rotary dryerin a pig farm which usedwaste heat at 400 degree Celsius from an electrical generator. The designed rotary dryer consisted of two pipes with lengths of 10 meters. These pipes consisted of a drying and a cooling pipe, each with a diameter of 0.5 meter. The power was supplied by two 5 horse power motors, and 2 horse power blowers were used to suck in hot and cool air for drying.The fertilizer,with an initial moisture content of 55-60 %db,was examined. Three parameters were varied to study the optimal condition of drying. These were rotary speed, degree of tilt angle and air flow rate. The rotary speed was varied at 10, 15 and 20 RPM, the degree of tilt angle was set at 1, 3 and 5 degrees, and the air flow rate was varied at 60, 120 and 180 cubic meters per hour. From the experiment, the result revealed that the condition of 1 degree of tilt angle, 10 rpm of rotary speed and an air flow rate of 180 cubic meters per hours were the optimal conditions for drying the fertilizer. The moisturein the fertilizer was reduced from 57.84 %dbto 12.45 %db. The drying rate was 56.93 kg/h, and the thermal efficiency was 79.24 %. The energy consumption was 328.64 kWh/ton. The capacity of the designed rotary dryer was 3 tons/day which is three times more than the amount of the traditional drying method. If the cost of the rotary dryer is 450,000 Baht, the payback period will be 3.73 months.",52
"Background: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized how research is carried out in many areas of biology and medicine. However, the analysis of NGS data remains a major obstacle to the efficient utilization of the technology, as it requires complex multi-step processing of big data demanding considerable computational expertise from users. While substantial effort has been invested on the development of software dedicated to the individual analysis steps of NGS experiments, insufficient resources are currently available for integrating the individual software components within the widely used R/Bioconductor environment into automated workflows capable of running the analysis of most types of NGS applications from start-to-finish in a time-efficient and reproducible manner. Results: To address this need, we have developed the R/Bioconductor package systemPipeR. It is an extensible environment for both building and running end-to-end analysis workflows with automated report generation for a wide range of NGS applications. Its unique features include a uniform workflow interface across different NGS applications, automated report generation, and support for running both R and command-line software on local computers and computer clusters. A flexible sample annotation infrastructure efficiently handles complex sample sets and experimental designs. To simplify the analysis of widely used NGS applications, the package provides pre-configured workflows and reporting templates for RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, VAR-Seq and Ribo-Seq. Additional workflow templates will be provided in the future. Conclusions: systemPipeR accelerates the extraction of reproducible analysis results from NGS experiments. By combining the capabilities of many R/Bioconductor and command- line tools, it makes efficient use of existing software resources without limiting the user to a set of predefined methods or environments. systemPipeR is freely available for all common operating systems from Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/systemPipeR).",68
"The determination of the efficiency of an electric motor or an inverter in an electric vehicle requires power measurements on the ac side of the inverter. Voltage and current signals arise there from the switching operation of the inverter and are therefore hardly bandlimited. The finite bandwidth of measurement devices, like sensors or ADCs, yields to a bandwidth limitation of the measured signals. This limitation modifies the measured signals and has an effect on the calculated power. Measurement uncertainty considerations require the evaluation of the relation between this bandwidth limitation and the resulting error in the power measurement. This relation allows then for evaluating the significance of the spectral components for the power calculation and the decision which components are relevant and must not be filtered out by a bandwidth limitation. This paper presents an evaluation method for determining the bandwidth limitation error and identifies critical quantities in a numerical study.",53
"ObjectiveThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the newly developed Headache Triggers Sensitivity and Avoidance Questionnaire (HTSAQ) designed to measure variables relating to the Trigger Avoidance Model of Headaches. BackgroundThe Trigger Avoidance Model of Headaches proposes that one pathway to developing a primary headache disorder is through the avoidance of headache triggers, resulting in an increase in trigger potency through sensitization. Conversely, prolonged exposure to certain triggers may reduce a potential trigger's ability to precipitate a headache. This model has led to an alternative approach to trigger management being proposed called Learning to Cope with Triggers, which advocates the desensitization of certain headache triggers through controlled exposure, while supporting avoidance of those triggers that are detrimental to health and wellbeing. To be able to evaluate predictions based on the Trigger Avoidance Model of Headaches and to investigate the effectiveness of Learning to Cope with Triggers, psychometrically sound measures of trigger sensitivity and trigger avoidance are needed. MethodA convenience sample of 376 participants (87.5% female; 64.1% European descent) was recruited for the online study which consisted of a battery of measures including the HTSAQ, Brief Headache Screen, Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale, Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire, Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire, and demographic items. With an interval of 2-6 weeks, a subsample of participants (n=201) completed the HTSAQ for a second time. The mean age of the sample was 31.4 years (SD=12.8). The most common headache diagnoses (based on the Brief Headache Screen) were migraine (chronic=62; episodic=160), followed by medication-overuse headache (n=87). The remaining participants (n=67) were diagnosed as having episodic less severe headache (most likely tension-type headache). ResultsReliability was assessed through internal consistency and test-retest reliability over a period of 2-6 weeks, and both were excellent (alpha>.80). Strong construct validity was demonstrated by the measure's scale scores being significantly correlated in theoretically consistent ways with the Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire, Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale, and Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire. As the Trigger Avoidance Model of Headaches would predict, correlations between the HTSAQ Sensitivity scales and the Avoidance scale were strong (P<.001), and participants with chronic migraine had significantly higher HTSAQ scores than those with episodic headaches. ConclusionThe findings support the use of the HTSAQ as a valid and reliable tool for assessing sensitivity to headache triggers and avoidance of headache triggers. Further research examining the factor structure of the HTSAQ is warranted.",10
"This study investigates the application of the sliding mode controller (SMC) for induction motor drive variable-displacement pressure-compensated pump (VDPC) system powered by an isolated wind/storage unit. The variable-speed wind turbine (WT) is proposed to drive a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) which, feeds a storing energy unit and stand-alone dynamic load. Energy storage systems are required for power balance quality in isolated wind power systems. Initially, the holistic model of the entire system is achieved, including the PMSG, the uncontrolled rectifier, the buck converter, the storage system, induction machine and the VDPC pump. The power absorbed by the connected loads can be effectively delivered and supplied by the proposed WT and energy storage systems, subject to sliding mode control. The main purposes are to supply 220 V/50 Hz through a three-phase inverter and adjust the IM speed and VDPC pump flow rate. The performance of the proposed system is compared with the neural network control and the conventional PID control. The simulation results show that the proposed system with the SMC and neural network controllers has good performance and good prediction of the electrical parameter waveforms compared with the case of the conventional PID controller.",59
"BackgroundAn extensive clinical literature has noted gender differences in the etiology and clinical characteristics of individuals with alcohol dependence (AD). Despite this knowledge, many important questions remain. MethodsUsing the 2001 to 2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (n=43,093), we examined differences in sociodemographic characteristics, psychiatric and medical comorbidities, clinical correlates, risk factors, and treatment-utilization patterns of men (N=2,974) and women (N=1,807) with lifetime AD. ResultsMen with lifetime AD were more likely than women to be diagnosed with any substance use disorder and antisocial personality disorder, whereas women were more likely to have mood and anxiety disorders. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and gender differences in psychiatric comorbidity in the general population, AD was associated with externalizing disorders and any mood disorder among women only. Men with AD met more criteria, had longer episodes, and were younger at the age of first drink. There were no gender differences in remission rates. Women with AD were more likely to have a family and a spouse with history of alcohol use disorders. Treatment rates were low for both genders, and women were more likely to report social stigmatization as a treatment barrier. ConclusionsThere are important gender differences in the psychiatric comorbidities, risk factors, clinical characteristics, and treatment-utilization patterns among individuals with lifetime AD.",73
"The enormous growth in the penetration of electric vehicles (EVs), has laid the path to advancements in the charging infrastructure. Connectivity between charging stations is an essential prerequisite for future EV adoption to alleviate user's range anxiety. The existing charging stations fail to adopt power provision, allocation and scheduling management. To improve the existing charging infrastructure, data based on real-time information and availability of reserves at charging stations could be uploaded to the users to help them locate the nearest charging station for an EV. This research article focuses on an a interactive user application developed through SQL and PHP platform to allocate the charging slots based on estimated battery parameters, which uses data communication with charging stations to receive the slot availability information. The proposed server-based real-time forecast charging infrastructure avoids waiting times and its scheduling management efficiently prevents the EV from halting on the road due to battery drain out. The proposed model is implemented using a low-cost microcontroller and the system etiquette tested.",51
"Orientation and wayfinding in architectural Immersive Virtual Environments (IVEs) are non-trivial, accompanying tasks which generally support the users' main task. World in Miniatures (WIMs)-essentially 3D maps containing a scene replica-are an established approach to gain survey knowledge about the virtual world, as well as information about the user's relation to it. However, for large-scale, information-rich scenes, scaling and occlusion issues result in diminishing returns. Since there typically is a lack of standardized information regarding scene decompositions, presenting the inside of self-contained scene extracts is challenging. Therefore, we present an automatic WIM generation workflow for arbitrary, realistic in-and outdoor IVEs in order to support users with meaningfully selected and scaled extracts of the IVE as well as corresponding context information. Additionally, a 3D user interface is provided to manually manipulate the represented extract.",79
"In order to promote the development of Green Building Market without bringing heavy financial burden to the government, this paper studies the optimal subsidy problem in Green Building Market from the perspective of policy benefit, in which the government and the end-user are the principals and the developer is their agent. Optimal subsidy principal-agent models under conditions of asymmetric information and complete information are established, and equivalent models are presented to get the optimal solutions. The results show that from the perspective of policy benefits, subsidy policy is influenced by construction costs, transfer paid by the end-user and developer's preference toward green buildings. Furthermore, comparisons of models under two conditions demonstrate that eliminating asymmetric information can contribute to more green building areas and fewer unit subsidies. Finally, a numerical example is presented to show the effectiveness of the model.",99
"The green building concept has recently gained momentum, and the success of green projects to a large extent depends on the life-cycle cost. Water conservation components contribute almost 12%-15% to the capital cost of a conventional residential building. This paper aims to analyze the financial feasibility of using water conservation components by evaluating their lifecycle costs and operational savings in large mass housing projects. Four components have been evaluated for a case project located in a metropolitan suburban location in India. To analyze the benefits, two different water tariffs are considered: local corporation combined with mineralized water and well water. Lifecycle cost analysis (LCCA) suggests that, excluding the rainwater harvesting component, the significant share of cost for all other components is related to maintenance, repair, and replacement activities. Results of the analysis suggest that water components do not pay a return when a local corporation water tariff is considered at an 8% discount rate. The results of this study are expected to benefit project stakeholders in mass housing projects for their financial and budgetary decisions, thus making implementation of these component-based designs feasible.

"Objective visual quality assessment of 3D models is a fundamental issue in computer graphics. Quality assessment metrics may allow a wide range of processes to be guided and evaluated, such as level of detail creation, compression, filtering, and so on. Most computer graphics assets are composed of geometric surfaces on which several texture images can be mapped to make the rendering more realistic. While some quality assessment metrics exist for geometric surfaces, almost no research has been conducted on the evaluation of texture-mapped 3D models. In this context, we present a new subjective study to evaluate the perceptual quality of textured meshes, based on a paired comparison protocol. We introduce both texture and geometry distortions on a set of 5 reference models to produce a database of 136 distorted models, evaluated using two rendering protocols. Based on analysis of the results, we propose two new metrics for visual quality assessment of textured mesh, as optimized linear combinations of accurate geometry and texture quality measurements. These proposed perceptual metrics outperform their counterparts in terms of correlation with human opinion. The database, along with the associated subjective scores, will be made publicly available online.",79
"Early Childhood Caries (ECC) is the most common, preventable disease of childhood. It can affect children's health and wellbeing and children from migrant families may be at greater risk of developing ECC. Objective: To describe ECC in children from migrant families, and explore possible influences. Basic research design: Cross-sectional analysis of caries data collected as baseline data for an oral health promotion study. Participants: The analysis sample included 630 1-4 year-old children clustered within 481 Iraqi, Lebanese and Pakistani families in Melbourne, Australia. Method: Child participants received a community-based visual dental examination. Parents completed a self-administered questionnaire on demographics, ethnicity, and oral health knowledge, behaviour and attitudes. Main outcome measure: Child caries experience. Bivariate associations between oral health behaviours and ethnicity were tested for significance using chi-square. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify associations with ECC, adjusting for demographic variables and accounting for clustering by family. Results: Overall, 34% of children in the sample experienced caries (both non-cavitated and cavitated). For all caries lesions, parent' length of residence in Australia, consumption of sweet drinks and parental education remained as independent predictors of child caries experience. Adding sugar to drinks was an additional risk factor for cavitation. Ethnicity was associated with some individual oral health behaviours suggesting cultural influences on health, however the relationship was not independent of other predictors. Conclusion: Culturally competent oral health promotion interventions should aim to support migrant families with young children, and focus on reducing sweet drink consumption.",117
"Human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) may contribute to the growth of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, there are certain differences in biology between CML and Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). Little is known about the role and mechanism of hBMSCs on the growth of TKI-resistant Ph+ ALL. The current study co-cultured hBMSCs with the TKI-resistant SUP-B15. Next, the proliferation of SUP-B15 was detected using a Cell Counting Kit-8. Additionally, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry were used to detect the expression of the associated genes and proteins. The present study explores the role and mechanism of hBMSCs on the growth of TKI-resistant Ph+ ALL. The current study showed that hBMSCs promoted the proliferation of TKI-resistant Ph+ ALL. This was shown by the increase in cells in the S+ G2-M phase of the cell cycle. It was also found that the expression of cyclins A, C, D1 and E was increased. Apoptosis was inhibited through upregulation of anti-apoptotic genes [B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) and BCL-extra large] and downregulation of apoptotic genes (BCL-XS, BCL-2-associated X protein, and caspases 3, 7 and 9). Expression of the breakpoint cluster region (BCR)-Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (ABL) gene, Wnt5a, and Wnt signaling pathway-associated genes (glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta, beta-catenin, E-cadherin and phosphoinositide 3-kinase) and transcription factors (c-myc, ephrin type-B2, fibroblast growth factor 20 and matrix metalloproteinase 7) was also increased. Furthermore, the expression of drug resistance genes (low-density lipoprotein receptor, multidrug resistanceasso-ciated protein and multi-drug resistance gene) was increased and the expression of anti-oncogenes (death-associated protein kinase and interferon regulatory factor-1) was decreased. It was concluded that hBMSCs promote the growth of TKI-resistant Ph+ ALL by these aforementioned mechanisms. Therefore, targeting hBMSCs may be a promising approach for preventing the growth of TKI-resistant Ph+ ALL.",37
"Oscillation test methodology (OTM) has been very effective in detecting physical defects such as open, shorts and bridging defects in low-voltage CMOS VLSI analog and mixed signal circuits. This paper discusses the OTM for low voltage two-stage operational amplifier using N-well 1 mu m CMOS technology with high fault coverage and minimum area overhead. Five bridging faults and one open fault have been detected. Discrete practical realizations and extensive simulations based on CMOS 1 mu m technology parameters using PSPICE affirm that the test technique presented for MOSFET circuits ensures high fault coverage and requires a negligible area overhead.",60
"This paper investigates the impact of plug-in electric vehicle (EV) integration on the power systems scheduling and energy cost. An intermediary entity, the EV aggregator, participates in the market on behalf of the EV owners by optimally self-scheduling under the price-taking approach. Through detailed rolling simulations for a year and different EVs' penetration scenarios at a large insular power system, this work highlights the different impact of direct and smart charging on power system scheduling and energy costs, the limitations of the price-taking approach, which is widely used in self-scheduling models, and the difference in system value and market value that smart charging adoption creates in restructured markets under the marginal pricing rule.",43
"We consider one applied global optimization problem where a set of feasible solutions is discrete and very large. The goal is to find optimal perfect gratings, which can guarantee high quality and security of the visual cryptography method. A priori estimation techniques, such as branch and bound type methods, cannot be applied to exclude an essential part of elements from the feasible set. Thus, a full search is required to solve this global optimization problem exactly, which is very computationally demanding. A library of C++ templates is developed that allows its user to implement parallel master-slave algorithms for his/her application without any knowledge of parallel programming API (application programming interface). Design of the templates allows users to build a parallel solver using MPI (message passing interface) API or distributed computing application using BOINC (Berkeley open infrastructure for network computing) API from the same C/C++ code with implementation of application-specific tasks. We build parallel and distributed computing solvers for the considered optimization problem and present results of computational experiments using a computer cluster and BOINC project for volunteer computing. Heuristic methods are also considered as an alternative to the full search algorithm. Due to complicated conditions defining feasible solutions (perfect gratings), genetic algorithms cannot be used to solve this problem efficiently. We propose two memetic heuristic algorithms, when a basic stochastic or simplified full search algorithm is combined with a local search algorithm. Parallel heuristic algorithms are also proposed and implemented. The efficiency and accuracy of heuristics are investigated and results of experiments are presented.",101
"E-waste recycling has become a global environmental health issue. Pernicious chemicals escape into the environment due to informal and nonstandard e-waste recycling activities involving manual dismantling, open burning to recover heavy metals and open dumping of residual fractions. Heavy metals derived from electronic waste (e-waste), such as, lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), aluminum (Al) and cobalt (Co), differ in their chemical composition, reaction properties, distribution, metabolism, excretion and biological transmission. Our previous studies showed that heavy metal exposure have adverse effects on children's health including lower birth weight, lower anogenital distance, lower Apgar scores, lower current weight, lower lung function, lower hepatitis B surface antibody levels, higher prevalence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and higher DNA and chromosome damage. Heavy metals influence a number of diverse systems and organs, resulting in both acute and chronic effects on children's health, ranging from minor upper respiratory irritation to chronic respiratory, cardiovascular, nervous, urinary and reproductive disease, as well as aggravation of pre-existing symptoms and disease. These effects of heavy metals on children's health are briefly discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",117
"In this paper, we present a numerical solution method which is based on Taylor Matrix Method to give approximate solution of the Bagley-Torvik equation. Given method is transformed the Bagley-Torvik equation into a system of algebraic equations. This algebraic equations are solved through by assistance of Maple 13. Then, we have coefficients of the generalized Taylor series. So, we obtain the approximate solution with terms of the generalized Taylor series. Further some numerical examples are given to illustrate and establish the accuracy and reliability of the proposed algorithm.",86
"Ulipristal acetate (UPA) and mifepristone are currently well-established agents for emergency contraception. Both drugs are selective progestogen receptor modulators which have been shown to have better efficacy than the widely used levonorgestrel in prevention of pregnancy. However, there is only limited information on the action of UPA on sperm function. The present study compared the in vitro biological effects of mifepristone and UPA on human sperm functions. Spermatozoa from semen samples with normal semen parameters were isolated. Capacitated spermatozoa were pre-incubated with 0.04, 0.4, 4 and 40m mifepristone or UPA for 1h. Sperm motility, viability, DNA integrity, capacitation, spontaneous acrosome reaction, spontaneous hyperactivation, zona pellucida (ZP) binding capability and intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+](i)) were determined. The effects of mifepristone and UPA on progesterone-induced acrosome reaction, hyperactivation and [Ca2+](i) were also studied. Our results showed that mifepristone and UPA dose-dependently suppressed progesterone-induced acrosome reaction, hyperactivation and [Ca2+](i) at concentrations 0.4m in human spermatozoa. Both compounds did not affect sperm motility, viability, DNA integrity, capacitation, spontaneous acrosome reaction, spontaneous hyperactivation, ZP binding capability and [Ca2+](i). This study demonstrated that UPA and mifepristone modulate human sperm functions by acting as progesterone antagonists. The results enable us to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms by which mifepristone and UPA work for emergency contraception, and provide a scientific basis for their clinical application.",124
"Model uncertainty and saturation in actuators are among some of the practical challenges in the controller design of autonomous vehicles. Incorporating adaptive control with anti-windup (AW) compensators can provide a convenient combination to counteract the challenge. In this manuscript, an adaptive control with a dynamic anti-windup compensator is proposed for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). Due to industrial and academic interests, the proposed method is embedded with a Proportional-Derivative-Integral (PID) controller. A modern AW technique is employed to cope with the saturation problem. Typical performance of the adaptive control system is achieved in the absence of actuator saturation. The performance is shown to degrade when the saturation has occurred. However the quality of the adaptive controller is improved when it is combined with an anti-windup compensator. Primarily six degrees of freedom (DOF) nonlinear motion equations of the vehicle are derived. Then, the proposed scheme is applied to this nonlinear model. Performance of the modified system is compared by the baseline controller. The effectiveness of the presented method in the presence of the actuator saturation, considering uncertainties, noise and disturbance is assessed and verified through simulation scenarios.

"Background: Indoor air pollution caused by fungal contamination is suspected to have a public health impact. Monitoring of the composition of the indoor airborne fungal contaminants is therefore important. To avoid problems linked to culture-dependent protocols, molecular methods are increasingly being proposed as an alternative. Among these molecular methods, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the real-time PCR are the most frequently used tools for indoor fungal detection. However, even if these tools have demonstrated their appropriate performance, some of them are not able to discriminate between species which are genetically close. A solution to this could be the use of a post-qPCR high resolution melting (HRM) analysis, which would allow the discrimination of these species based on the highly accurate determination of the difference in melting temperature of the obtained amplicon. In this study, we provide a proof-of-concept for this approach, using a dye adapted version of our previously developed qPCR SYBR (R) Green method to detect Aspergillus versicolor in indoor air, an important airborne fungus in terms of occurrence and cause of health problems. Despite the good performance observed for that qPCR method, no discrimination could previously be made between A. versicolor, Aspergillus creber and Aspergillus sydowii. Methods: In this study, we developed and evaluated an HRM assay for the discrimination between A. versicolor, Aspergillus creber and Aspergillus sydowii. Results: Using HRM analysis, the discrimination of the 3 Aspergillus species could be made. No false positive, nor false negatives were observed during the performance assessment including 20 strains of Aspergillus. The limit of detection was determined for each species i.e., 0.5 pg of gDNA for A. creber and A. sydowii, and 0.1 pg of gDNA for A. versicolor. The HRM analysis was also successfully tested on environmental samples. Conclusion: We reported the development of HRM tools for the discrimination of A. versicolor, A. creber and A. sydowii. However, this study could be considered as a study case demonstrating that HRM based on existing qPCR assays, allows a more accurate identification of indoor air contaminants. This contributes to an improved insight in the diversity of indoor airborne fungi and hence, eventually in the causal link with health problems.",37
"Purpose: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals are significantly more likely to smoke compared with their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts. The purpose of this study was to explore barriers to and facilitators of smoking cessation readiness among LGBT smokers. Methods: This descriptive study used a qualitative approach. Four 90-minute focus groups (eligibility criteria: age 21, self-identify as LGBT, current smoker, interest in quitting smoking) were conducted. Participants also completed a brief survey that measured additional demographic characteristics and smoking behaviors. Topics explored included quit experiences, attitudes and beliefs, barriers to and facilitators of cessation, and cultural factors related to smoking behaviors. Established qualitative methods were used to conduct the focus groups and data analysis. Results: The mean age of participants (N = 31) was 37.1 years with the majority identifying as male (58.1%). The sample group was racially diverse: 32% were African American, 39% were White, and 29% were more than one race. Interest in quitting was high (M = 9.0, range 0-10). Barriers to smoking cessation fell under the broad themes of individual-level factors, cultural factors, psychosocial factors, and access to treatment. Facilitators of smoking cessation included stage of readiness, health concerns, social stigma, a shift in social norms, financial costs, and improving dating prospects. Conclusions: Interest in smoking cessation was high in this sample of LGBT smokers and influenced by a range of facilitators. Nevertheless, several general and culturally specific barriers to smoking cessation readiness were identified. The study results have implications for future research and the development of outreach, prevention, and treatment programs.",26
"In grapevine, berry growth after veraison is paralleled by a notable intake of water and sugar. Our results show that in 'Sultanina', a seedless variety, this intake is significantly improved by gibberellic acid (GA(3)), which is normally sprayed to get a commercial berry size. As at this stage the pedicel xylem functionality is lost, it is presumed that water transport occurs via the phloem. This implies a possible role of water channels in cell membranes (aquaporins). Two complementary approaches were used to evaluate the effect of GA(3) on the expression of aquaporin genes. In the first one, PIP and TIP probes derived from 'Sultanina' cloned amplicons and ESTs were used for Northern blotting. Results from these experiments showed that there was not a uniform type of response, with some genes exhibiting a more intense expression at early developmental stages than at veraison, and others showing a lower expression difference. In second place, we confirmed a possible role for GA controlling PIP/TIP gene expression, but again, the results were quite diverse in terms of timing and level of response to the hormonal treatment. In spite of this diversity, a tendency to maintain a higher expression level during post-veraison in GA(3)-treated plants was observed. Microarray hybridizations showed a heterogeneous response to GA-treatment for different genes of the aquaporin family. However, these last experiments must be considered preliminary, both because of technical issues, mainly the requirement of a better reproducibility level, and because of pre-veraison being the developmental stage when one of the lowest levels of aquaporin genes expression was observed.",38
"Sex steroids have been widely described to be associated with a number of human diseases, including hormone-dependent tumors. Several studies have been concerned about the factors regulating the availability of sex steroids and its importance in the pathophysiological aspects of the reproductive cancers in women. In premenopausal women, large fluctuations in the concentration of circulating estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) orchestrate many events across the menstrual cycle. After menopause, the levels of circulating E2 and P4 decline but remain at high concentration in the peripheral tissues. Notably, there is a strong relationship between circulating sex hormones and female reproductive cancers (e.g. ovarian, breast, and endometrial cancers). These hormones activate a number of specific signaling pathways after binding either to estrogen receptors (ERs), especially ER alpha, ER alpha 36, and ER beta or progesterone receptors (PRs). Importantly, the course of the disease will depend on particular transactivation pathway. Identifying ER- or PR-positive tumors will benefit patients in terms of proper endocrine therapy. Based on hormonal responsiveness, effective prevention methods for ovarian, breast, and endometrial cancers represent a special opportunity for women at risk of malignancies. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) might significantly increase the risk of these cancer types, and endocrine treatments targeting ER signaling may be helpful against E2-dependent tumors. This review will present the role of sex steroids and their receptors associated with the risk of developing female reproductive cancers, with emphasis on E2 levels in pre and postmenopausal women. In addition, new therapeutic strategies for improving the survival rate outcomes in women will be addressed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",9
"This study aimed to identify the cues upon which athletes rely when developing their expectations with regard to the competence of sports officials and to examine the sources of information, which are given priority in different kinds of sport (i.e. team, racquet and fighting sports). A questionnaire - the Athlete Perception of Sports Officials Questionnaire (APSO-Q) - was developed in which athletes (N=472) were asked to indicate the influence of 32 cues on their impressions of sports officials. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) yielded a four-factor model (i.e. static cues, psychological, communicational and performance cues). Athletes mostly rely on psychological and personal communication attributes when evaluating officiating competence. Moreover, team players perceived that static cues were more influential when forming their expectations of sports officials than racquet players and fighting contestants. Such findings may have implications for athlete-official relationships and training of sports officials.",63
"BACKGROUND Ageing is a complex process that is due to accumulation of molecular damage over time. Ageing is a biological reality which has its own dynamics beyond human control. People aged 60+ years are generally referred to as older population. Both intrinsic ageing (genetic, chronological ageing) and extrinsic ageing (environmental, photo-ageing) contribute to cutaneous ageing. Common skin disorders in elderly are xerosis, pruritus, dermatoheliosis, seborrheic keratosis, cherry angioma, herpes zoster, dermatophytosis, cellulitis and eczemas. With this background, I propose this study to determine the pattern of cutaneous manifestations in geriatric population attending tertiary care centre. The aim is to study the pattern of skin diseases in geriatric age. MATERIALS AND METHODS Three hundred patients above 60 years of age attending Dermatology OPD in tertiary care hospital, Puducherry were chosen as study group. The study was carried out for 2 years. A detailed history was taken and general, systemic and cutaneous examination was carried out. All cutaneous and mucosal lesions were recorded. Relevant investigations, which included haemogram, biochemical tests and skin biopsy were performed. RESULTS Total of 300 patients studied of which 197 (66%) were male and 103 (34%) were female. Pruritus (44%) was the commonest complaint noted in this study. Xerosis (93%) was the commonest physiological change seen. Systemic hypertension (23%) was the commonest associated systemic illness. Lichen simplex chronicus (11%) was the commonest eczema. Fungal infection (11%) was the commonest infection. Bullous pemphigoid (1%) was the only bullous disorder encountered in this study. Greying of hair (90%) was the commonest hair change and vertical ridging of nails (40%) was the commonest physiological nail change seen in this study. CONCLUSION As there is significant number of geriatric population, the increased emphasis on geriatric medicine is inevitable. This present study helps in providing greater understanding of pattern of geriatric dermatoses that aids in early diagnosis and management.",126

"Brachypodium distachyon, is a new model plant for most cereal crops while gliadin is a class of wheat storage proteins related with wheat quality attributes. In the published B. distachyon genome sequence databases, no gliadin gene is found. In the current study, a number of gliadin genes in B. distachyon were isolated, which is contradictory to the results of genome sequencing projects. In our study, the B. distachyon seeds were found to have no gliadin protein expression by gel electrophoresis, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and Western blotting analysis. However, Southern blotting revealed a presence of more than ten copies of alpha-gliadin coding genes in B. distachyon. By means of AS-PCR amplification, four novel full-ORF alpha-gliadin genes, and 26 pseudogenes with at least one stop codon as well as their promoter regions were cloned and sequenced from different Brachypodium accessions. Sequence analysis revealed a few of single-nucleotide polymorphisms among these genes. Most pseudogenes were resulted from a C to T change, leading to the generation of TAG or TAA in-frame stop codon. To compare both the full-ORFs and the pseudogenes among Triticum and Triticum-related species, their structural characteristics were analyzed. Based on the four T cell stimulatory toxic epitopes and two ployglutamine domains, Aegilops, Triticum, and Brachypodium species were found to be more closely related. The phylogenetic analysis further revealed that B. distachyon was more closely related to Aegilops tauschii, Aegilops umbellulata, and the A or D genome of Triticum aestivum. The alpha-gliadin genes were able to express successfully in E. coli using the functional T-7 promoter. The relative and absolute quantification of the transcripts of alpha-gliadin genes in wheat was much higher than that in B. distachyon. The abundant pseudogenes may affect the transcriptional and/or posttranscriptional level of the alpha-gliadin in B. distachyon.",39
"Statins are hypocholesterolemic drugs that are prescribed for patients with an increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications. Ezetimibe has an atheroprotective activity through inhibition of the expression of vascular adhesion molecule-I and vascular CD14, a marker of the infiltration of mononuclear leukocytes. Ezetimibe reduces the amount of chemoattractant protein-1 that is available for monocytes and macrophages and alters the activity of nuclear factor kappa B in leukocytes. The mechanisms of action of statins complement those of ezetimibe. Previous studies have demonstrated that the combination of statins and ezetimibe has beneficial effects, including antiinflammatory activity. The present study evaluated the effects of monotherapy with ezetimibe and simvastatin compared with ezetimibe + simvastatin combined on the evolution of the inflammatory response in a rat model of Complete Freund's Adjuvant-induced arthritis. The animals were treated with 10 mg/kg ezetimibe, 40 mg/kg simvastatin, or 10 mg/kg ezetimibe + 40 mg/kg simvastatin for 1, 7, 14, or 28 days. We analyzed leukocyte rolling behavior, leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium, the number of leukocytes that were recruited to the knee joint cavity, and the concentration of cytokines that are involved in the inflammatory response. The data were analyzed using paired t tests or analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni post hoc test. The treatments reduced leukocyte rolling behavior and leukocyte adhesion. The monotherapies did not change the number of leukocytes that were recruited to the knee joint cavity, whereas the ezetimibe + simvastatin combination significantly reduced this parameter. The treatments reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and increased the levels of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10, indicating antiinflammatory properties of these drugs in this experimental model of inflammation.",23
"A large set of earthquake records from the highly instrumented Samoa Channel bridge-ground system has been compiled and made available by the California Geological Survey. During six seismic events, more than 30 data channels have been documenting the seismic response of the bridge, abutments, and adjacent ground surface. Of special interest is the response of one of the bridge piers with records at the deck level, pile cap and within the underlying pile foundation. Response of this pile foundation is compared to that of the ground as documented by the nearby Eureka geotechnical downhole array. In this paper, records from the strongest to date 2010 Ferndale earthquake (PGA of about 0.16 g), along with other available low-amplitude events (2007-2014) are employed to evaluate the ground, pile foundation, and overall bridge seismic response. Spatial variation of the recorded motions is examined. Linear and nonlinear response of the ground and the bridge are assessed using system identification techniques. During the strong shaking phase of the 2010 Ferndale Earthquake, a clear and significant stiffness reduction was observed in the column as well as in the foundation of the instrumented pier.",49
"The prospect for consistent computer-aided refinement of stereoselective enzymes is explored by simulating the hydrolysis of enantiomers of an a-substituted ester by wild-type and mutant Candida antarctica lipase A, using several strategies. In particular, we focused on the use of the empirical valence bond (EVB) method in a quantitative screening for enantioselectivity, and evaluate both kcat and kcat/KM of the R and S stereoisomers. We found that an extensive sampling is essential for obtaining converging results. This requirement points towards possible problems with approaches that use a limited conformational sampling. However, performing the proper sampling appears to give encouraging results and to offer a powerful tool for the computer-aided design of enantioselective enzymes. We also explore faster strategies for identifying mutations that will help in augmenting directed-evolution experiments, but these approaches require further refinement.",36
"Soil scientists in the USA have created a large national database of written soil profile descriptions that follow a well-defined set of rules for describing soil morphological properties. Interpreting these soil descriptions is a skill that requires considerable practice and experience. While writing a soil description is straightforward, recreating a visual representation of a soil profile from a written description is very difficult. So far, there is no generalized approach for translating written or tabular soil descriptions into visual representations. We propose a novel procedural modeling approach inspired by procedural models commonly used in the field of computer graphics. Our framework takes tabular soil morphological data (i.e., soil profile descriptions) as textual input and translates it into visual features based on parametric models. These models can be used to generate two-dimensional soil profiles or to generate three-dimensional interactive models that allow rotation, scaling, and other forms of visual explorations. The procedural modeling technique enables the user to generate the soil profile visual representation with only a small amount of data. The images do not need to be stored because they are generated as needed.",79
"The pins are sub-assemblies of 3-cone drilling bits used to dislodge the rock. Pin head may have different shapes (chisel, hemisphere, etc.) according to the intended nature of the rock. The pin body has a cylindrical shape and serves to hold (embed) them into the body rolls. The pins are made by sintered carbide that combines the best contradictory properties such as hardness and toughness. Because the sintered metal carbides break after suffering a very small plastic strain, they are classified as brittle materials. In the following, the authors present results of studies conducted under conditions that partially reproduce the actual conditions (lack of drilling fluid, however, acutes test conditions), on the cutting structures of the 3-cone drill bits for making it clear that in these subsets, the tensions while working at the base of the drilling hole do not exceed the strength of materials they are made of.",91
"We present a logic for reasoning about attribute dependencies in data involving degrees such as a degree to which an object is red or a degree to which two objects are similar. The dependencies are of the form A a double dagger' B and can be interpreted in two ways: first, in data tables with entries representing degrees to which objects (rows) have attributes (columns); second, in database tables where each domain is equipped with a similarity relation. We assume that the degrees form a scale equipped with operations representing many-valued logical connectives. If 0 and 1 are the only degrees, the algebra of degrees becomes the two-element Boolean algebra and the two interpretations become well-known dependencies in Boolean data and functional dependencies of relational databases. In a setting with general scales, we obtain a new kind of dependencies with naturally arising degrees of validity, degrees of entailment, and related logical concepts. The deduction rules of the proposed logic are inspired by Armstrong rules and make it possible to infer dependencies to degrees-the degrees of provability. We provide a soundness and completeness theorem for such a setting asserting that degrees of entailment coincide with degrees of provability, prove the independence of deduction rules, and present further observations.",112
"The aim of regenerative medicine is replacing missing or damaged bone tissues with synthetic grafts based on porous interconnected scaffolds, which allow adhesion, growth, and proliferation of the human cells. The optimal design of such scaffolds, in the Bone Tissue Engineering field, should meet several geometrical requirements. First, they have to be customized to replicate the skeletal anatomy of the patient, and then they have to provide the proper trabecular structure to be successfully populated by the cells. Therefore, for modelling such scaffolds, specific design methods are needed to conceive extremely complex structures by controlling both macro and micro shapes. For this purpose, in the last years, the Computer Aided Design of Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces has received considerable attention, since their presence in natural shapes and structures. In this work, we propose a method that exploit Triply Periodic Minimal Surfaces as unit cell for the development of customized trabecular scaffolds. The aim is to identify the mathematical parameters of these surfaces in order to obtain the target requirements of the bone grafts. For that reason, the method is implemented through a Generative Design tool that allow to interactively controlling both the porosity and the pores size of the scaffolds.",82
"This paper presents a design of a 3rd order Butterworth Gm-C Low Pass Filter (LPF) for WiMAX receivers in a 90nm CMOS process. Due to its robustness to process parameter tolerances, a passive LC-ladder filter was emulated using the Signal Flow Graph (SFG) method. As a building block for the LPF, a highly linear operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) based on bias-offset cross-coupled differential pairs was designed and characterized. With this OTA's property of having its transconductance linearly controlled by a DC voltage bias, the corner frequency of the filter can be externally tuned to achieve the WiMAX specifications for bandwidth. From layout simulations, the LPF achieved a bandwidth of 10MHz at 0.5V DC bias, under a 1V supply. HD2 at 50mV peak, 1KHz input is -40.38dBc. With the addition of a source follower at the output, the filter attained good output matching, with an S-22 of -16.45dB. The total power dissipation is 5.26mW.",56
"Zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN), transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) are the most commonly used genome editing tools. Previous studies demonstrated that hypothermia treatment increased the mutation rates induced by ZFNs and TALENs in mammalian cells. Here, we characterize the effect of different culture temperatures on CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing and find that the genome editing efficiency of CRISPR-Cas9 is significantly hampered by hypothermia treatment, unlike ZFN and TALEN. In addition, hyperthermia culture condition enhances genome editing by CRISPR-Cas9 in some cell lines, due to the higher enzyme activity and sgRNA expression level at higher temperature. Our study has implications on CRISPR-Cas9 applications in a broad spectrum of species, many of which do not live at 37 degrees C.

"In the process of cardiac remodeling, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) is secreted from cardiac myocytes. Though CTGF is well known to promote fibroblast proliferation, its pathophysiological effects in cardiac myocytes remain to be elucidated. In this study, we examined the biological effects of CTGF in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. Cardiac myocytes stimulated with full length CTGF and its C-terminal region peptide showed the increase in cell surface area. Similar to hypertrophic ligands for G-protein coupled receptors, such as endothelin-1, CTGF activated amino acid uptake; however, CTGF-induced hypertrophy is not associated with the increased expression of skeletal actin or BNP, analyzed by Northern-blotting. CTGF treatment activated ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, JNK and Akt. The inhibition of Akt by transducing dominant-negative Akt abrogated CTGF-mediated increase in cell size, while the inhibition of MAP kinases did not affect the cardiac hypertrophy. These findings indicate that CTGF is a novel hypertrophic factor in cardiac myocytes. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",38
"Soft drink industries suffer inadequate handling of their product losses generally considered as wastes. Those products contribute to the wastewater organic load augmentation and cause fastidious environmental impact. In this study, an industrial scale bioconversion process based on multistage fermentation was proposed to treat and reuse soft drink factories' high-loaded effluents for valuable components production. An upstream segregation of non-consumed beverage was performed to reduce the organic load of the soft drink wastewater. Beverage characterization revealed an important sugar content. Such an organic compound is undoubtedly responsible of the high organic load of soft drink wastewater. Thus, the bioconversion of the sugar content of soft drink waste to single-cell proteins was proposed as a solution to reduce wastewater polluting load. Soft drink wastewater including rejected and returned products was tested to be used as a substrate for yeast biomass production using a commercial yeast strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The effect of nutrient supplementation and the initial sugar concentration effect in culture media on the biomass production were investigated using batch and fed-batch process. Results indicated that supplementation is necessary for successful fermentation. Juices and nectars gave better sugar-biomass conversion yields (0.38-0.45 g g(-1)). Depletion of the sugar contained in the soft drinks exceeded 96 % for all fermented media. Fed-batch culture revealed a biomass concentration improvement reaching 9.16 g L-1 compared to batch biomass concentration resulting from batch cultures (5.2 g L-1). The proposed process was shown to enable beverage industries to reduce water pollution generation through an on-site segregation procedure and a storage system to valorize product losses as source medium for single-cell protein production.",96
"Visual-spatial working memory measures are widely used in clinical and experimental settings. Furthermore, it has been argued that the male advantage in spatial abilities can be explained by a sex difference in visual-spatial working memory. Therefore, sex differences in visual-spatial working memory have important implication for research, theory, and practice, but they have yet to be quantified. The present meta-analysis quantified the magnitude of sex differences in visual-spatial working memory and examined variables that might moderate them. The analysis used a set of 180 effect sizes from healthy males and females drawn from 98 samples ranging in mean age from 3 to 86 years. Multilevel meta-analysis was used on the overall data set to account for non-independent effect sizes. The data also were analyzed in separate task subgroups by means of multilevel and mixed-effects models. Results showed a small but significant male advantage (mean d = 0.155, 95 % confidence interval = 0.087-0.223). All the tasks produced a male advantage, except for memory for location, where a female advantage emerged. Age of the participants was a significant moderator, indicating that sex differences in visual-spatial working memory appeared first in the 13-17 years age group. Removing memory for location tasks from the sample affected the pattern of significant moderators. The present results indicate a male advantage in visual-spatial working memory, although age and specific task modulate the magnitude and direction of the effects. Implications for clinical applications, cognitive model building, and experimental research are discussed.",115
"We describe the main features of the developed software tool, namely PlatE-Motion 2.0 (PEM2), which allows inferring the Euler pole parameters by inverting the observed velocities at a set of sites located on a rigid block (inverse problem). PEM2 allows also calculating the expected velocity value for any point located on the Earth providing an Euler pole (direct problem). PEM2 is the updated version of a previous software tool initially developed for easy-to-use file exchange with the GAMIT/GLOBK software package. The software tool is developed in Matlab(A (R)) framework and, as the previous version, includes a set of MATLAB functions (m-files), GUIs (fig-files), map data files (mat-files) and user's manual as well as some example input files. New changes in PEM2 include (1) some bugs fixed, (2) improvements in the code, (3) improvements in statistical analysis, (4) new input/output file formats. In addition, PEM2 can be now run under the majority of operating systems. The tool is open source and freely available for the scientific community.",68
"Climate change is a hugely important issue human being are facing. Sustainable development and green building can be one of the solutions to mitigate the impacts of climate change. Pervious concrete is one type of green material. Pervious concrete can keep the runoff of rainwater as a water resource, such that the environment can be preserved and heat island effects can be reduced. In general, pervious concrete is not only used on pavement but also employed in coastal structures, artificial fish reefs, and seawalls in Taiwan. This paper focused on studying the characteristics of applying the designed pervious concrete on pavement and seawall utility. The experimental results showed that the compression strength of the field specimen can be up to 275.7 kgf/cm(2), and as such, does exceed the specifications of normal concrete structure. The pervious concrete used in this study had the capacity to penetrate water, and the field permeability test for the simulated field site is 1100 ml/15 sec. As for the seawall made of the pervious concrete, the experimental results showed that the seawall does reduce the phenomena of wave run-up by comparing the seawall made of normal concrete specimens. Furthermore, it was shown that the surface temperature of the pervious concrete fluctuates quicker than normal concrete does. The preliminary results of this study are valuable and serve a useful reference for designing and constructing pervious concrete in the future.",99
"Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables provably secure communication between two parties over an optical fiber that arguably withstands any form of attack. Besides the need for a suitable physical signalling scheme and the corresponding devices, QKD also requires a secret key distillation protocol. This protocol and the involved signal processing handle the reliable key agreement process over the fragile quantum channel, as well as the necessary post-processing of key bits to avoid leakage of secret key information to an eavesdropper. In this paper we present in detail an implementation of a key distillation engine for a QKD system based on the coherent one-way (COW) protocol. The processing of key bits by the key distillation engine includes agreement on quantum bit detections (sifting), information reconciliation with forward error correction coding, parameter estimation, and privacy amplification over an authenticated channel. We detail the system architecture combining all these processing steps, and discuss the design trade-offs for each individual system module. We also assess the performance and efficiency of our key distillation implementation in terms of throughput, error correction capabilities, and resource utilization. On a single-FPGA ( Xilinx Virtex-6 LX240T) platform, the system supports distilled key rates of up to 4 Mbps.",57
"Background: Product inhibition can reduce catalytic performance of enzymes used for biofuel production. Different mechanisms can cause this inhibition and, in most cases, the use of classical enzymology approach is not sufficient to overcome this problem. Here we have used a semi-rational protein fusion strategy to create a product-stimulated enzyme. Results: A semi-rational protein fusion strategy was used to create a protein fusion library where the Bacillus subtilis GH11 xylanase A (XynA) was inserted at 144 surface positions of the Escherichia coli xylose binding protein (XBP). Two XynA insertions at XBP positions 209 ([209]XBP-Xyn-XBP) and 262 ([262]XBP-Xyn-XBP) showed a 20% increased xylanolytic activity in the presence of xylose, conditions where native XynA is inhibited. Random linkers of 1-4 Gly/Ala residues were inserted at the XynA N- and C-termini in the [209]XBP and [262]XBP, and the chimeras 2091A and 2621B were isolated, showing a twofold increased xylanolytic activity in the presence of xylose and k(cat) values of 200 and 240 s(-1) in the 2091A and 2621B, respectively, as compared to 70 s-1 in the native XynA. The xylose affinity of the XBP was unchanged in the chimeras, showing that the similar to 3-to 3.5-fold stimulation of catalytic efficiency by xylose was the result of allosteric coupling between the XBP and XynA domains. Molecular dynamics simulations of the chimeras suggested conformation alterations in the XynA on xylose binding to the XBP resulted in exposure of the catalytic cavity and increased mobility of catalytic site residues as compared to the native XynA. Conclusions: These results are the first report of engineered glycosyl hydrolase showing allosteric product stimulation and suggest that the strategy may be more widely employed to overcome enzyme product inhibition and to improve catalytic performance.",36
"The gut is densely inhabited by commensal bacteria, which metabolize dietary fibers/undigested carbohydrates and produce short-chain fatty acids such as acetate. GPR43 is one of the receptors to sense short-chain fatty acids, and expressed in various immune and non-immune cells. Acetate/GPR43 signaling has been shown to affect various inflammatory diseases through Th17 responses and NADPH oxidase (NOX)-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. However, no study has previously explored the effects of GPR43 activation during psoriasis like inflammation. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of acetate/phenylacetamide (GPR43 agonists) on imiquimod induced skin inflammation in mice. Mice were administered phenylacetamide/acetate followed by assessment of skin inflammation, NOXs (NOX-2, NOX-4, dual oxidases), and Th17 related signaling. Our study showed induction of epidermal GPR43 after imiquimod treatment, i.e. psoriasis-like inflammation. Acetate administration in psoriatic mice led to further increase in skin inflammation (ear thickness/myeloperoxidase activity) with concurrent increase in Th17 immune responses and epidermal dual oxidase-2 signaling. Further, topical application of GPR43 agonist, phenylacetamide led to enhanced ear thickness with concomitant epidermal IL-6 signaling as well as dual oxidase-2 upregulation which may be responsible for increased psoriasis-like inflammation. Taken together, dual oxidase-2 and IL-6 play important roles in GPR43-mediated skin inflammation. The current study suggests that GPR43 activation in psoriatic patients may lead to aggravation of psoriatic inflammation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",109
"The smart home field has witnessed rapid developments in recent years. Internet of Things applications for the smart home are very heterogeneous and continuously increasing in number, making user management from a security perspective very challenging. Moreover, the resource-constrained nature of most of the devices implies that any security mechanisms deployed should be lightweight and highly efficient. In this article, we propose an authentication scheme based on symmetric key cryptography, combined with a capability-based access control system, to provide the different stakeholders (residents, recurring guests, or temporary guests) end-to-end secure access to the Internet of Things devices in a smart home, managed by the home owner in an anonymous way. The operations in our scheme only include a small number of communication phases and protect the identities of the entities involved (i.e. stakeholders and end-nodes) from any outside entity. The proposed scheme ensures that even if the stakeholder's device or the Internet of Things device is attacked, the system remains secure.",57
"It is well known that there are linear-space data structures for 2-D orthogonal range counting with worst-case optimal query time O(log n/ loglog n). We give an O(n log log n)-space adaptive data structure that improves the query time to O(log log n + log k/ log log n), where k is the output count. When k = O(1), our bounds match the state of the art for the 2-D orthogonal range emptiness problem [Chan et al., 2011]. We give an O(n log log n)-space data structure for approximate 2-D orthogonal range counting that can compute a (1 + delta)-factor approximation to the count in O(log log n) time for any fixed constant delta >0. Again, our bounds match the state of the art for the 2-D orthogonal range emptiness problem. Last, we consider the 1-D range selection problem, where a query in an array involves finding the kth least element in a given subarray. This problem is closely related to 2-D 3-sided orthogonal range counting. Recently, Jorgensen and Larsen [2011] presented a linear-space adaptive data structure with query time O(log log n + log k/ log log n). We give a new linear-space structure that improves the query time to O(1 + log k/log log n), exactly matching the lower bound proved by Jorgensen and Larsen.",41
"Although it has long been established that estrogen alters circadian rhythms in behavior, physiology, and reproductive functions in mammals, the molecular mechanism for these effects remains unknown. To explore the possibility that estrogen affects circadian rhythms by changing the expression of clock-related genes, we investigated the effects of chronic treatment with 17 beta-estradiol (E2) on the expression of Per1 and Per2 genes in the brain (suprachiasmatic nucleus and cerebral cortex) and periphery (liver, kidney, and uterus) of ovariectomized rats by means of in situ hybridization and northern blotting. In the brain, E2 treatment advanced the peak of Per2 mRNA expression in the SCN; however, it failed to affect the rhythm of Per2 mRNA expression in the CX and Per1 mRNA expression in both the SCN and the CX. In nonreproductive peripheral tissues (liver and kidney), E2 delayed the phase and increased the amplitude of Per1 mRNA expression. In the reproductive tissues (uterus), biphasic rhythms in Per1 and Per2 mRNA were observed after E2 treatment. These findings suggest that the effects of estrogen are different between central and peripheral clock in the brain, and between reproductive and nonreproductive tissues in the periphery.

"A power and area efficient metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET)-only 1.5-bit fully differential pipelined analog-to-digital converter (ADC) stage is proposed and designed in TSMC 0.18 mu m digital CMOS technology with supply voltage of 1.8 V. It is based on charge pump based technique to achieve the stage voltage gain of 2. Various capacitances are implemented by MOSCAPs (capacitance offered by the MOSFET), offering compatibility with cheaper digital complimentary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process in order to reduce the much required manufacturing cost. The proposed stage suffers from only linear gain error with full signal swing of 2 V peak-to-peak (p-p) differential. Using the proposed stage, un-calibrated signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) and spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) for 10-bit, 100 MS/s pipelined ADC are 40.11 and 40.86 dB, respectively, which can be further increased by using a simple digital calibration technique. Comparison between the proposed stage and conventional operational amplifier based stage shows insensitivity towards capacitor mismatch along with power savings and design simplicity.",60
"BackgroundPrevious studies found that metformin provided some renoprotection for diabetic renal damage. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of different doses of metformin on the expression of renal tissue nephrin in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) model rats and the possible mechanism underlying its protective effect in kidney podocytes. MethodsA high-fat diet combined with a low dose of streptozotocin was used to induce T2DM model rats. Diabetic rats were treated with 150, 300, or 500mg/kg metformin for 8weeks. At the end of the study, urine and blood samples were collected for measurement of different indices. Light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were used to identify morphological changes. Renal expression of nephrin protein was assayed by immunohistochemical staining, whereas real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect renal nephrin (Nphs1) mRNA expression. ResultsMetformin treatment of T2DM rats produced dose-dependent significant reductions in urinary albumin and nephrin concentrations, glomerular basement membrane thickness (GBMT), and the foot process fusion rate (FPFR) compared with control T2DM model rats, whereas renal expression of nephrin protein and Nphs1 mRNA was dose-dependently increased by metformin treatment. ConclusionMetformin protects kidney podocytes in T2DM model rats by dose-dependently adjusting renal nephrin expression.",37
"The failure of the key parts, such as bearings and gears, in cutting drum long chain gear driving system of long-wall shearer is a crucial factor for service life of gear systems. A short driving system is driven by multiple electric motors for cutting drum has been proposed as an alternative to long chain gear driving system. An electromechanical dynamic model based on lumped-parameter method of short driving system is established considering the effect of intrinsic mechanical characteristic of electric motor. By taking into account time-varying stiffness, damping, electric motor synchronization error, manufacturing eccentric error and transmission error of gears, the load-sharing characteristic and dynamic characteristic of the multiple motor driving unit (MMDU) of short driving system are analyzed under shock load. The results of simulation show that the electric motor synchronization error has significant effect on the load-sharing characteristic of MMDU. The load-sharing coefficient evidently increases as the electric motor synchronization error go up, decreasing the electric motor synchronization error can improve the load-sharing characteristic of MMDU; and the synchronization error must be controlled fewer than 5 % to ensure the load-sharing coefficient of the MMDU under 1.1. The imbalance of dynamic meshing force distribution of pinions of the MMDU can be obviously decreased and the load-sharing characteristic of the MMDU can be greatly improved by controlling the synchronization error of electric motor, but the effect is unobvious by controlling the manufacturing eccentric error or transmission error. It provides an effective method to choose a suitable control ranges under different synchronization errors of electric motor according to different load-sharing requirements for the MMDU.",53
"Cointegration analysis is particularly sensitive to outlying observations. Traditional robust approaches rely on parameter estimates based on weighting schemes to penalize aberrant units. This, in particular, is the idea underlying pseudo maximum likelihood robust estimators. Atypical observations, however, can reveal useful information about the investigated phenomenon. Aiming to detect these observations, we extend the forward search procedure to the cointegrated vector autoregressive model. The analysis is carried out by building up subsets of increasing dimension and monitoring suitable statistics at each subset size. Simulation experiments and real data analysis highlight that our forward search is more effective than the pseudo maximum likelihood in detecting atypical units and data structures.",41
"Species of the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup, including the species D. simulans, D. mauritiana, D. yakuba, and D. santomea, have long served as model systems for studying evolution. However, studies in these species have been limited by a paucity of genetic and transgenic reagents. Here, we describe a collection of transgenic and genetic strains generated to facilitate genetic studies within and between these species. We have generated many strains of each species containing mapped piggyBac transposons including an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) gene expressed in the eyes and a phi C31 attP site-specific integration site. We have tested a subset of these lines for integration efficiency and reporter gene expression levels. We have also generated a smaller collection of other lines expressing other genetically encoded fluorescent molecules in the eyes and a number of other transgenic reagents that will be useful for functional studies in these species. In addition, we have mapped the insertion locations of 58 transposable elements in D. virilis that will be useful for genetic mapping studies.",34
"The objective of the study was to demonstrate the effectiveness of a college course in preconception health and prenatal development at improving reproductive health awareness in college students. Students enrolled in the course completed pretest and posttest assessments and a course evaluation. Students' self-perception of awareness of the positive and negative factors that can affect pregnancy increased from 13% at the beginning of the course to 89 and 93% at the end of the course, respectively. Correspondingly, students' knowledge of course-related information improved across nearly all areas assessed. The average score among students increased from 67 to 90% correct from pretest to posttest. Course evaluation results indicated that over 94% of students found the course to be beneficial and informative. College courses are a practical way to disseminate reproductive and prenatal health information. Educating college students in these areas has clear benefits to both individual students and society and, as such, merits increased attention in college curricula.",75
"Rationale, aims and objectivesThe nature of the relationship between bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder has been an intense field of debate in the last two decades. Current diagnostic classifications approach this complex phenomenon using syndromatic definitions based on presence or absence of a restricted set of signs or symptoms that have demonstrated low specificity. One of the several utilities of the phenomenological method in psychiatry is to complement the clinical panorama, helping in the process of identifying potential differences between two separated clinical syndromes. The main objective of this publication is to explore one particular clinical difference between these two conditions - that is, the experience of self-continuity and time perception. Methodsthe argument explored in this paper is based on previous second-person or phenomenological accounts of sufferers of both conditions. Results and ConclusionsWhereas borderline personality disorder patients tend to experience only the present moment, referring frequent difficulties of drawing experiences of the past in order to determine their own future, bipolar disorder patients are constantly worried about the contradictions in their past experiences and the latent risk of losing control of themselves in future episodes of their disease. This contrast should be, however, corroborated in future research comparing directly the two groups in terms of the continuity of the self and their temporal structures.",70
"Introduction: Allergen-specific immunotherapy is the only curative approach for the treatment of allergies. There is an urgent need for improved therapies, which increase both, efficacy and patient compliance. Novel routes of immunization and the use of more advanced vaccine platforms have gained heightened interest in this field. Areas covered: The current status of allergen-specific immunotherapy is summarized and novel routes of immunization and their challenges in the clinics are critically discussed. The use of nanoparticles as novel delivery system for allergy vaccines is comprehensively reviewed. Specifically, the advantages of silica nanoparticles as vaccine carriers and adjuvants are summarized. Expert opinion: Future allergen-specific immunotherapy will combine engineered hypoallergenic vaccines with novel routes of administration, such as the skin. Due to their biodegradability, and the easiness to introduce surface modifications, silica nanoparticles are promising candidates for tailor-made vaccines. By covalently linking allergens and polysaccharides to silica nanoparticles, a versatile vaccination platform can be designed to specifically target antigen-presenting cells, render the formulation hypoallergenic, and introduce immunomodulatory functions. Combining potent skin vaccination methods, such as fractional laser ablation, with nanoparticle-based vaccines addresses all the requirements for safe and efficient therapy of allergic diseases.",105
"In this paper, a stable and robust filter is proposed for structural identification. This filter resolves the instability problems of the traditional extended Kalman filter (EKF). Instead of ad hoc assignment of the noise covariance matrices in the EKF, the proposed stable robust extended Kalman filter (SREKF) provides real-time updating of the noise parameters. This resolves the well-known instability problem of the EKF due to improper assignment of the noise covariance matrices. Furthermore, the proposed SREKF is capable of removing abnormal data points in a real-time manner. As a result, the parametric identification results will be more reliable and have fewer fluctuations. The proposed approach will be applied to structural damage detection of degrading linear and nonlinear structures in comparison with the plain EKF, utilizing highly contaminated response measurements. It turns out that the estimation error of the state vector and the structural parameters is lower than the EKF by one and two orders of magnitude, respectively.

"Comprehensive psychiatric rehabilitation programs in Latin America have been designed across several countries in the region without yet achieving full implementation. Facing an increasing burden of disease due to mental disorders, including alcohol and substance use disorders, the region has responded unevenly to the challenge. Moreover, low priority for mental health in national policies and insufficient funding for mental health services are common barriers for the much-needed mental health services reforms. Reestablishing a primary care community-based model of care has been a shared aspiration for most countries during the last two decades. Comprehensive models of psychiatric rehabilitation developed predominantly in high-income countries need to be culturally adapted to local contexts, while strengthening health systems research will provide evidence on the efficiency of locally designed interventions and on the critical milestones to succeed in the scaling up strategies. Increasing participation of patients and their families in the mental health delivery system is another key factor in order to ensure comprehensive patient-centred psychosocial rehabilitation programs in Latin America.",125
"We determined whether time-domain P3 amplitude and time-frequency principal component (TF-PC) reductions could serve as stable and predictive developmental endophenotypes of externalizing psychopathology. Participants from the Minnesota Twin Family Study were assessed at age 17 and again at age 29 for lifetime externalizing (EXT) disorders. Comparisons of P3 amplitude and TF-PCs at delta and theta frequencies were made between EXT and unaffected comparison subjects. P3 amplitude and all five extracted TF-PCs were significantly reduced in those presenting lifetime EXT disorders at both ages 17 and 29 and showed substantial 12-year rank-order stability. P3 amplitude and delta TF-PCs measured at age 17 also predicted subsequent development of EXT by age 29, with every 1-microvolt decrease in age 17 amplitude associated with an approximately 5% increase in risk for an EXT diagnosis by age 29. Overall, results from this study further confirm that these P3-derived brain measures maintain their potential as putative EXT endophenotypes through the third decade of life.",73
"Geometric and electrostatic modeling is an essential component in computational biophysics and molecular biology. Commonly used geometric representations admit geometric singularities such as cusps, tips and self-intersecting facets that lead to computational instabilities in the molecular modeling. The present work explores the use of flexibility and rigidity index (FRI), which has a proved superiority in protein B-factor prediction, for biomolecular geometric representation and associated electrostatic analysis. FRI rigidity surfaces are free of geometric singularities. We proposed a rigidity based Poisson -Boltzmann equation for biomolecular electrostatic analysis. Our approaches to surface and electrostatic modeling are validated by a set of 21 proteins. Our results are compared with those of established methods. Finally, being smooth and analytically differentiable, FRI rigidity functions offer excellent curvature analysis, which characterizes concave and convex regions on protein surfaces. Polarized curvatures constructed by using the product of minimum curvature and electrostatic potential is shown to predict potential protein-ligand binding sites. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"Objective: The objective was to identify predictors of adherence to hormonal contraceptives in a female veteran population. Study Design: This was a retrospective cohort study of female veterans from the VA San Diego Healthcare System. The study period was April 1, 2010, to March 31, 2012. Each patient was followed for 1 year from the index date, defined as the date of first contraceptive prescription in the study time period. Adherence was defined as a medication possession ratio >= 0.9. Income was estimated using zip-code-based median household income and split into quintiles (quintile 1 being the lowest-earning group). Logistic regression was used to analyze the association between adherence and the independent variables. Results: A total of 805 patients were included in the final analysis. The majority of the population was white (62.2%) and receiving a 3-month supply of medication (87.6%). The following independent variables were predictive of increased adherence: 3-month supply versus 1-month supply [odds ratio (OR) 1.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-3.13], age group 40-45 versus 18-24 (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.16-5.70) and income quintiles 3 (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.16-3.29), 4 (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.06-2.98) and 5 (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.03-2.98) each versus quintile 1 as reference group. The following were associated with decreased adherence: new start versus continuing user (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.18-0.37), OB/GYN provider versus primary care provider (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38-0.95), and highest weight group versus lowest weight group (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.17-0.94). Conclusion: Hormonal contraceptive adherence in the veteran population is below optimal. Providing 3-month supplies of high-value therapies such as hormonal contraceptives is one strategy that may improve adherence. Initiatives to target lower socioeconomic status or new start populations to increase contraceptive adherence should also be considered. Implications: Adherence to hormonal contraceptives is not as well studied in the literature as some other high-value therapies. Identifying predictive variables for adherence may have implications for establishing possible interventions, or refining benefit structures, in order to increase adherence.

"The Rapid Prototyping (RP) manufacture technology, computer tomography (CT) image processing, and mechanical analyses were adopted to repair a skull defect injury. After the patient was inspected by spiral CT the data was exported to Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format. The data was processed with Mimics software to eliminate noise and gray-level registration. The processing filtered out the parenchyma data and preserved the bone data. The STL files were analyzed and processed by the Magics and put into the RP equipment. The RP equipment is one type of Stereo Lithography Apparatus (SLA) with laser light spot diameter that is 50.2 mm. The 3D models were analyzed to comply with the patients' requirements. The stereo lithography model emulated the mechanical properties and shape with the patient's bone. The titanium-alloy plate matched the anatomy well. The 3D reconstructed freeform model was accurate to within 0.2 mm.",84
"The effects of basin hydrology on hydraulic geometry of channels variability for incised streams were investigated using available field data sets and models of watershed hydrology and channel hydraulics for the Yazoo River basin, USA. The study presents the hydraulic geometry relations of bankfull discharge, channel width, mean depth, cross-sectional area, longitudinal slope, unit stream power, and mean velocity at bankfull discharge as a function of drainage area using simple linear regression. The hydraulic geometry relations were developed for 61 streams, 20 of them are classified as channel evolution model (CEM) Types IV and V and 41 of them are CEM streams Types II and III. These relationships are invaluable to hydraulic and water resources engineers, hydrologists, and geomorphologists involved in stream restoration and protection. These relations can be used to assist in field identification of bankfull stage and stream dimension in un-gauged watersheds as well as estimation of the comparative stability of a stream channel. A set of hydraulic geometry relations are presented in this study, these empirical relations describe physical correlations for stable and incised channels. Cross-sectional area, which combines the effects of channel width and mean channel depth, was found to be highly responsive to changes in drainage area and bankfull discharge. Analyses of cross-sectional area, channel width, mean channel depth, and mean velocity in conjunction with changes in drainage area and bankfull discharge indicated that the channel width is much more responsive to changes in both drainage area and bankfull discharge than are mean channel depth or mean velocity.

"The aim of this work is to design robust control algorithms of aerial robots, i.e. quadrotors, for team transportation of a deformable linear object (DLO). The DLO-robot attachment makes the whole system physically coupled by an elastic element, which introduces strong non-linearities in the system dynamics. Sections in quasi-stationary state of the DLO hanging freely from two extreme points can be modeled by catenary curves, so we are able to build a detailed and accurate simulation of the system as the workbench for the evaluation of alternative quadrotor control approaches. DLO transportation is an instance of a follow the leader team strategy, in which the local quadrotor control must cope with the dynamic perturbations due to the DLO linking the quadrotors. The quadrotor team control has two phases, one achieving a spatial configuration with equal energy consumption, the other is to manage the horizontal motion which is the transportation process per se. In this paper we deal with the second control problem, assuming the first solved. We use proportional derivative (PD) controllers for both quadrotor attitude and trajectory control. Offline PD parameter setting carried by metaheuristic optimization can not cope with the perturbations induced by the DLO and environmental conditions, i.e. wind shear. Therefore we propose an adaptive controller for the quadrotors carrying out the DLO transportation task which uses fuzzy modeling of the error in order to modulate the activation of the PD parameters adaptation rules, which are error gradient descent rules. Computational experiments on our system simulation workbench show that our adaptive approach scales well when increasing the number of quadrotors, providing smooth follow-the-leader team strategy navigation behaviors even under strong wind perturbation conditions. We compare our approach with other state-of-the-art online and offline approaches.",59
"The aim of this study was to investigate possible association of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position 9250 in exon 7 of the Osteopontin gehe (OPN gene 9250) with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). A case control association study was performed in 120 AS patients and 106 matched controls, consented to participate in the study. OPN gene 9250 polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. The frequency of the TC+CC genotype of the OPN gene 9250 was significantly higher (25.83% vs 12.26%, p < 0.05) and the frequency of C allele was significantly higher (17.50% vs 8.96%, p < 0.01) in AS patients than in controls. There were significant differences in OPN gene 9250 allele and phenotype frequencies between the AS patients and controls (p < 0.05). OPN gene 9250 polymorphism appears to be associated with susceptibility to AS in Chinese patients.",107
"Introduction: Neuroinflammation is a crucial mechanism in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases pathophysiology. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) YKL-40 - an indicator of microglial activation - has recently been identified by proteomic studies as a candidate biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD).Areas covered: We review the impact of CSF YKL-40 as a pathophysiological biomarker for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. CSF YKL-40 concentrations have been shown to predict progression from prodromal mild cognitive impairment to AD dementia. Moreover, a positive association between CSF YKL-40 and other biomarkers of neurodegeneration - particularly total tau protein - has been reported during the asymptomatic preclinical stage of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Albeit preliminary, current data do not support an association between APOE-epsilon 4 status and CSF YKL-40 concentrations. When interpreting the diagnostic/prognostic significance of CSF YKL-40 concentrations in neurodegenerative diseases, potential confounders - including age, metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors, diagnostic criteria for selecting cases/controls - need to be considered.Expert opinion/commentary: CSF YKL-40 represents a pathophysiological biomarker reflecting immune/inflammatory mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases, associated with tau protein pathology. Besides being associated with tau pathology, CSF YKL-40 adds to the growing array of biomarkers reflecting distinct molecular brain mechanisms potentially useful for stratifying individuals for biomarker-guided, targeted anti-inflammatory therapies emerging from precision medicine.",106
"HMGCS2 (mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-COA synthase 2) is a control enzyme in ketogenesis. The mitochondrial localization and interaction with APP (beta-amyloid precursor protein) suggest that HMGCS2 may play a role in the pathophysiology of AD (Alzheimer's disease). Here we report that overexpression of HMGCS2 decreased levels of APP and related CTFs (carboxy-terminal fragments), which was largely prevented by an autophagic inhibitor chloroquine. In addition, HMGCS2 enhancement of autophagic marker LC3II was diminished by rapamycin, an inhibitor of mechanistic target of rapamycin. Moreover, deprivation of EBSS (Earle's Balanced Salt Solution) significantly augmented the effect of HMGCS2 on LC3II, while acetoacetate reversed the reduction of LC3II, APP and CTFs which was induced by HMGCS2 knockdown. In the presence of acetoacetate, rapamycin failed to induce further increase of LC3IL which mimicked the effect of HMGCS2 overexpression. Finally, HMGCS2 enhanced the antioxidant response. Collectively, HMGCS2 shares with ketone bodies common features in autophagic clearance of APP and CTFs, suggesting that ketone bodies play an important role in HMGCS2 regulation of the autophagy.

"To assess the role of single-photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography (SPECT-CT) for the identification of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in patients with early stage (T1-T2) oral cancer and a clinically negative neck (cN0). In addition to planar lymphoscintigraphy, SPECT-CT was performed in 66 consecutive patients with early stage oral cancer and a clinically negative neck. The addition of SPECT-CT to planar images was retrospectively analyzed for the number of additional SLNs, more precise localization of SLNs, and importance of anatomical information by a team consisting of a nuclear physician, surgeon, and investigator. Identification rate for both imaging modalities combined was 98% (65/66). SPECT-CT identified 15 additional SLNs in 14 patients (22%). In 2/15 (13%) of these additional SLNs, the only metastasis was found, resulting in an upstaging rate of 3% (2/65). In 20% of the patients with at least one positive SLN, the only positive SLN was detected due to the addition of SPECT-CT. SPECT-CT was considered to add important anatomical information in two patients (3%). In 5/65 (8%) of the patients initially scored SLNs on planar lymphoscintigrams were scored as non-SLNs when SPECT-CT was added. There were four false-negative SLN biopsy procedures in this cohort. The addition of SPECT-CT to planar lymphoscintigraphy is recommended for the identification of more (positive) SLNs and better topographical orientation for surgery in sentinel lymph node biopsy for early stage oral cancer.",14
"Differences in people's beliefs can substantially impact their interpretation of a series of events. In this functional MRI study, we manipulated subjects' beliefs, leading two groups of subjects to interpret the same narrative in different ways. We found that responses in higher-order brain areas-including the default-mode network, language areas, and subsets of the mirror neuron system-tended to be similar among people who shared the same interpretation, but different from those of people with an opposing interpretation. Furthermore, the difference in neural responses between the two groups at each moment was correlated with the magnitude of the difference in the interpretation of the narrative. This study demonstrates that brain responses to the same event tend to cluster together among people who share the same views.",62
"The paper presents direct measurement of in-cylinder friction from a single cylinder motocross race engine under motored conditions and compares the same with a new analytical predictive method. These conditions are encountered in piston-cylinder system with the application of cylinder deactivation (CDA) technology, which is a growing trend. The analytical method takes into account the various regions within instantaneous contact of compression ring-cylinder liner, including lubricant film rupture, cavitation zone and the subsequent lubricant film reformation. The analysis also includes the effect of boundary friction and lubricant rheology. The predictions and direct measurements of cyclic friction show good agreement and indicate dominance of viscous friction under the investigated engine running conditions. In particular, it is shown that the compression ring contribution to in-cycle friction is most pronounced in the region of high cylinder pressures because of combined Poiseuille friction and some boundary solid interactions. The combined experimental-analytical approach has not hitherto been reported in literature.",87
"Astronomy has a rich tradition of using color photography and imaging, for visualization in research as well as for sharing scientific discoveries in formal and informal education settings (i. e., for "" public outreach""). In the modern era, astronomical research has benefitted tremendously from electronic cameras that allow data and images to be generated and analyzed in a purely digital form with a level of precision that previously was not possible. Advances in image-processing software have also enabled color-composite images to be made in ways that are much more complex than with darkroom techniques, not only at optical wavelengths but across the electromagnetic spectrum. The Internet has made it possible to rapidly disseminate these images to eager audiences. Alongside these technological advances, there have been gains in understanding how to make images that are scientifically illustrative as well as aesthetically pleasing. Studies have also given insights on how the public interprets astronomical images and how that can be different than professional astronomers. An understanding of these differences will help in the creation of images that are meaningful to both groups. In this invited review, we discuss the techniques behind making color-composite images as well as examine the factors one should consider when doing so, whether for data visualization or public consumption. We also provide a brief history of astronomical imaging with a focus on the origins of the "" modern era"" during which distribution of highquality astronomical images to the public is a part of nearly every professional observatory's public outreach. We review relevant research into the expectations and misconceptions that often affect the public's interpretation of these images.",90
"The wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD) is used for temporary protection of patients deemed to be at high risk for sudden death (SCD) not yet meeting indications for the implantable defibrillator (ICD). To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and compliance of/to WCD use and subsequent medium-term outcome of patients in a single-center observational study. A total of 102 consecutive patients were fitted with the WCD from 2012 to 2015 and followed for a mean of 11 months (+/- 8 months). The most common clinical indication for WCD-prescription (63%) was a new diagnosis of severely impaired LV function (LVEF <= 35%). The median wear time of the WCD was 54 days with a daily use of 23 h. Appropriate WCD therapy occurred in four patients (seven shocks for VF, one shock for VT). An ICD was finally implanted in 56 patients (55%). Improvement in LV function was the most common reason not to implant an ICD (HR 0.37; 95% CI 0.19-0.73; p = 0.004). Two patients had inappropriate shocks from their WCD due to atrial fibrillation/flutter. Five patients fitted with an ICD after the end of WCD therapy suffered VT/VF episodes. After wearing the WCD, six patients died (five ICD recipients and one non-ICD recipient). WCD therapy was well accepted by patients and provided temporary protection against ventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients at risk for SCD. The WCD may help to avoid unnecessary ICD implantations in a significant proportion of patients.",111
"Impaired manual dexterity is a frequently reported disability in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and is increasingly prevalent with worsening disease. While various tests and patient-reported outcome measures are available, the Nine-Hole Peg Test (NHPT) is considered as a gold standard measure of manual dexterity and most frequently used in MS research and clinical practice. The MS Outcome Assessments Consortium (MSOAC) includes representatives from advocacy organizations, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), academic institutions, and industry partners along with persons living with MS. Among the MSOAC goals are acceptance and qualification by regulators of performance outcomes that are highly reliable and valid, practical, cost-effective, and meaningful to persons with MS. A critical step for these neuroperformance metrics is elucidation of clinically relevant benchmarks, well-defined degrees of disability, and gradients of change that are deemed clinically meaningful. This article addresses the NHPT, the proposed MSOAC measure for upper extremity function. We find that the NHPT is reliable within and between test sessions, discriminates between healthy subjects and MS patients with different levels of upper limb impairment, and shows high convergent validity with other manual dexterity as well as more comprehensive upper limb measures. Ecological validity is established by its relation to perceived upper limb use in daily life and perceived difficulty in performing activities of daily living. The NHPT is responsive to deterioration in longitudinal studies, and research suggests that a 20% change in test score is commonly used to define clinically meaningful worsening, a definition that needs further validation in all stages of the disease.",11
"Under investigation in this paper is a -dimensional variable-coefficient generalized shallow water wave equation. Bilinear forms, Backlund transformation and Lax pair are obtained based on the Bell polynomials and symbolic computation. One-, two- and three-soliton solutions are derived via the Hirota method. One-periodic wave solutions are obtained via the Hirota-Riemann method. Discussions indicate that the one-periodic wave solutions approach to the one-soliton solutions when . Propagation and interaction of the soliton solutions have been discussed graphically. We find that not the soliton amplitudes, but the velocities are related to the variable coefficients and . Phase shifts of the two-soliton solutions are the only differences to the superposition of two one-soliton solutions, so the amplitudes of the two-soliton solutions are equal to the sum of the corresponding two one-soliton solutions.",24
"This paper contains an extensive review of life cycle assessment (LCA) studies on greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from different material-based photovoltaic (PV) and working mechanism-based concentrating solar power (CSP) electricity generation systems. Statistical evaluation of the life cycle GHG emissions is conducted to assess the role of different PVs and CSPs in reducing GHG emissions. The widely-used parabolic trough and central receiver CSP electricity generation systems emitted approximately 50% more GHGs than the paraboloidal dish, solar chimney, and solar pond CSP electricity generation systems. The cadmium telluride PVs and solar pond CSPs contributed to minimum life cycle GHGs. Thin-film PVs are also suitable for wider implementation, due to their lower Energy Pay-Back Time (EPBT) periods, in addition to lower GHG emission, in comparison with c-Si PVs.",100
"Background: There are multiple etiologies responsible for infectious gastroenteritis causing acute diarrhea which are often under diagnosed. Also acute diarrhea is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality among children less than 5 years of age. Methods: In our study, fecal samples (n = 130) were collected from children (< 5 years) presenting with symptoms of acute diarrhea. Samples were screened for viral, bacterial, and parasitic etiologies. Rotavirus and Adenovirus were screened by immunochromatographic tests. Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (EPEC, EHEC, STEC, EAEC, O157, O111), Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., Vibrio cholera, Cryptosporidium spp., and Giardia spp. were detected by gene-specific polymerase chain reaction. Results: Escherichia coli was detected to be the major etiological agent (30.07%) followed by Rotavirus (26.15%), Shigella (23.84%), Adenovirus (4.61%), Cryptosporidium (3.07%), and Giardia (0.77%). Concurrent infections with two or more pathogens were observed in 44 of 130 (33.84%) cases with a predominant incidence particularly in < 2-year-old children (65.90%) compared to children of 2-5 years age group (34.09%). An overall result showed significantly higher detection rates among children with diarrhea in both combinations of two as well as three infections concurrently (p = 0.004915 and 0.03917, respectively). Conclusion: Suspecting possible multiple infectious etiologies and diagnosis of the right causative agent(s) can aid in a better pharmacological management of acute childhood diarrhea. It is hypothesized that in cases with concurrent infections the etiological agents might be complementing each other's strategies of pathogenesis resulting in severe diarrhea that could be studied better in experimental infections.",37
"Computing discrete geodesic distance over triangle meshes is one of the fundamental problems in computational geometry and computer graphics. In this problem, an effective window pruning strategy can significantly affect the actual running time. Due to its importance, we conduct an in-depth study of window pruning operations in this paper, and produce an exhaustive list of scenarios where one window can make another window partially or completely redundant. To identify a maximal number of redundant windows using such pairwise cross checking, we propose a set of procedures to synchronize local window propagation within the same triangle by simultaneously propagating a collection of windows from one triangle edge to its two opposite edges. On the basis of such synchronized window propagation, we design a new geodesic computation algorithm based on a triangle-oriented region growing scheme. Our geodesic algorithm can remove most of the redundant windows at the earliest possible stage, thus significantly reducing computational cost and memory usage at later stages. In addition, by adopting triangles instead of windows as the primitive in propagation management, our algorithm significantly cuts down the data management overhead. As a result, it runs 4-15 times faster than MMP and ICH algorithms, 2-4 times faster than FWP-MMP and FWP-CH algorithms, and also incurs the least memory usage.",79
"Human metabolism is a fundamental and important aspect of thermal comfort prediction. However, to date, most previous thermal comfort studies tended to treat metabolic rate as a constant value that only depends on activity level without consideration of ambient thermal conditions. In this paper, we explore the impacts of indoor thermal conditions on occupants' metabolic rate and try to describe such impacts in a straightforward way. Climate chamber experiments, including both physiological measurements and subjective questionnaires, were conducted at temperatures ranging from cold to hot with two clothing insulation levels. The results indicate that human metabolic rate can be significantly affected by thermal conditions such as ambient temperature and clothing insulation. The changing trend of metabolic rate can be expressed as a second-order polynomial equation with actual thermal sensations or other predicted values. Generally, a neutral thermal sensation corresponds to the lowest metabolic value, while the metabolic rate increases when thermal sensation departs from neutral to the cold or warm side. For instance, the metabolic rate at a sensation of 'cold' is 16.6% higher than it is in 'neutral' sensation. These findings, especially the modified equations describing metabolic rate changes, can serve as useful reference for future thermal comfort studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",32
"This paper aims to present an economic model characterized by a set of axioms that are consistent with the laws of thermodynamics. Two new axioms-weak G-disposability (i.e., weak directional disposability) and output essentiality-are introduced to satisfy the materials balance principle and the entropy law, respectively. The axiomatic production model is compared to other well-known production models that account for the joint production of good and bad outputs to illustrate the advantages of the new modeling approach.",88
"Ecological control line is a system innovation in the field of ecological environment protection in China and it has become as an important strategy of national ecological protection. Ten years have passed since the first ecological control line in Shenzhen was delimited in 2005. This study examines the connotations of ecological control line and the current study status in China and abroad, and then takes a brief description about the delimitation background and existing problems of the ecological control line in Shenzhen. The problem-solving strategy is gradually transforming from extensive management to refined management. This study proposes a differential ecological space management model that merges the space system, management system, and support system. The implementation paths include the following five aspects: delimiting ecological bottom lines to protect core ecological resources; formulating access systems for new construction projects to strictly control new construction; implementing construction land inventory reclamation assisted by market means; regulating boundary adjusting procedures and processes; and constructing ecological equity products by using multiple means to implement rights relief. Finally, this study illustrates the progress of the implementation and discusses the rigorousness and flexibility problems of ecological control line and calls for the promotion of the legislation. The management model and implementation paths proposed in this study have referential significance for developing countries and megacities to achieve ecological protection and sustainable development.

"This paper introduces a Smart Energy Management System capable of controlling energy and smart home devices to optimize the power consumption of several buildings individually and smooth consumption peaks by means of a central system. The proposed model consists of two main systems; the Energy Storage Units and the Central Energy Management System. The first ones are able to store energy, communicate with X10 devices and transmit information regarding household consumption. Finally, the Central System is in charge of controlling the Energy Storage Units, analyzing the information provided through data mining techniques and deciding the best operation strategy for each unit, so that they can smooth their load curves. The strategy consists of a set of semantic rules, based on sequential patterns, which aim to avoid peaks by shutting down low-priority X10 devices and using properly the energy stored.",92
"Introduction: Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (VVC) is a common medical health problem of adult women. It is most commonly caused by Candida albicans. But there is a change in fungal profile. Sabouraud's Dextrose Agar (SDA) is the most common culture medium used where mixed fungal infection may be missed. It can be detected easily by using chromogenic culture medium. Aim: To know the fungal profile of vulvovaginal candidiasis using Candida CHROMagar and antifungal susceptibility pattern in patients attending tertiary care hospital. Materials and Methods: Culture confirmed cases of VVC presented at Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), Puducherry, India, from July 2015 to December 2015 were included in the cross- sectional study. Two high vaginal swabs were collected and inoculated on SDA and Candida CHROMagar (Hi- Media, Mumbai, India). After overnight incubation the colonies were counted and colour of the colonies were recorded from Candida CHROMagar. Candida spp. were identified by sugar fermentation and assimilation tests and other conventional tests. Antifungal susceptibility tests were performed by the disc diffusion method using fluconazole (25 mu g) and voriconazole (1 mu g) as per the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI-M44-A2) guidelines. Results: A total of 50 culture confirmed (23.7%) cases were detected from 211 clinically suspected VVC cases. Candida glabrata (45.1%) was the most common isolate, followed by Candida tropicalis (23.5%), Candida albicans (17.6%), Candida krusei (9.8%) and Candida parapsilosis (3.9%). One mixed infection of C. glabrata and C. albicans was identified on Candida CHROMagar. Mixed fungal infection was observed in 2% of positive culture and 0.5% of VVC cases. The antifungal susceptibility testing revealed that 15.7% and 9.8% isolates of Candida spp. were resistant and Susceptible Dose Dependent (S-DD) respectively to fluconazole. The increase resistant against fluconazole was because of increased isolation of C. glabrata strains. All strains of Candida spp. were susceptible to voriconazole. Conclusion: C. glabrata was the most common causative agent of VVC in a tertiary care hospital. Chromogenic culture medium facilitates detection of mixed fungal infection. In vitro susceptibility testing should be used to guide the treatment especially in cases of non-albicans Candidiasis.",126
"Third generation wireless systems are expected to provide wide-area wireless Internet and multimedia services including multiparty conferencing based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Satellite UNITS (S-UMTS) constitutes a promising alternative for the provision of these types of multiparty conferencing services due to its wide area coverage properties. However, supporting multiparty conferencing over S-UMTS is a challenging task due to the more complicated signalling involved compared to point-to-point sessions, and also due to the more adverse channel condition and long round trip delay encountered over the satellite radio links. This paper describes the end-to-end signalling flow for conferencing creation over S-UMTS and investigates its performance over the satellite radio interface. The variations of the Radio Link Control (RLC) parameters and retransmission options on the overall conference creation performance are also examined.",54
"Background. Improvement of postural control in persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) is an important target for neurorehabilitation. Although PwMS are able to improve postural performance with training, the neural underpinnings of these improvements are poorly understood. Objective. To understand the neural underpinnings of postural motor learning in PwMS. Methods. Supraspinal white matter structural connectivity in PwMS was correlated with improvements in postural performance (balancing on an oscillating surface over 25 trials) and retention of improvements (24 hours later). Results. Improvement in postural performance was directly correlated to microstructural integrity of white matter tracts, measured as radial diffusivity, in the corpus callosum, posterior parieto-sensorimotor fibers and the brainstem in PwMS. Within the corpus callosum, the genu and midbody (fibers connecting the prefrontal and primary motor cortices, respectively) were most strongly correlated to improvements in postural control. Twenty-four-hour retention was not correlated to radial diffusivity. Conclusion. PwMS who exhibited poorer white matter tract integrity connecting the cortical hemispheres via the corpus callosum showed the most difficulty learning to control balance on an unstable surface. Prediction of improvements in postural control through training (ie, motor learning) via structural imaging of the brain may allow for identification of individuals who are particularly well suited for postural rehabilitation interventions.",11
Presented is a feed-forward controller that coordinates engine fueling with a purge event to reduce air-fuel ratio excursions. The controller employs a linear parameter-varying model to estimate the necessary changes in fuel pulse-width based on a hydrocarbon sensor located in the purge line. Synchronization between the purge fuel vapor arrival at the intake manifold and the fueling command is realized using a transport delay model. The proposed controller is experimentally validated on a Ford 5.4-L port injected engine and a 3.6-L EcoBoost engine. Significant reductions in air-fuel ratio excursions are achieved during the steady-state engine operating conditions associated with highway conditions.,87
"A miniature thermoacoustic stirling engine was simulated and designed, having overall size of length 0.65 m and height of 0.22 in. The acoustic field generated in this miniature system has been described and analyzed. Some efforts had been paid to coupling and matching, and a miniature thermoacoustic engine and some extra experimental components have been constructed. Analysis and experimental results showed that to obtain better performance of the engine, the diameter of the resonance tube must be chosen appropriately according to the looped tube dimension and the input heating power. It provided an effective way to miniaturize the thermoacoustic stirling heat engine. The experimental results showed that the engine had low onset temperature and high pressure amplitude and ratio. With the filling helium gas of 2 MPa and heating power of 637 W, the maximal peak to peak pressure amplitude and pressure ratio reached 2.2 bar and 1.116, respectively, which was able to drive a refrigerator, a heat pump or a linear electrical generator. The operating frequency of the engine was steady at 282 Hz. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",52
"In the present study, the method of slurry coating process was used to fabricate functionally graded thermal barrier coating (FG-TBC) for turbocharger application. An automatic film applicator was used for the coating in an attempt to minimize the production cost of ceramic thermal barrier coatings. Yttria stabilized zirconia ceramic and nickel metal powders were mixed in appropriate proportion and produced a functionally graded material mixture. A slurry based coating method was used for the fabrication of the FG-TBC. The coating compositions of 30 wt% Yttria Stabilized Zirconia and 70 wt% Nickel, 55 wt% Yttria Stabilized Zirconia and 45 wt% Nickel as well as 75 wt% Yttria Stabilized Zirconia and 25 wt% Nickel were used in depositing the first, second and third layers of the functionally graded thermal barrier coating on the substrate respectively. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscope and X-ray Diffraction were used to study and evaluate the integrity and reliability of the coating produced. The results have indicated the sustainability and suitability of the method adopted in the study with regards to the production of good and quality functionally graded thermal barrier coating with no spallation problem and having good adherence to the substrate.

"Objective: This exploratory study provided a proof of concept of a new procedure using multivariate electroencephalographic (EEG) topographic markers of cortical connectivity to discriminate normal elderly (Nold) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) individuals. Method: The new procedure was tested on an existing database formed by resting state eyes-closed EEG data (19 exploring electrodes of 10-20 system referenced to linked-ear reference electrodes) recorded in 42 AD patients with dementia (age: 65.9 years +/- 8.5 standard deviation, SD) and 42 Nold non-consanguineous caregivers (age: 70.6 years +/- 8.5 SD). In this procedure, spectral EEG coherence estimated reciprocal functional connectivity while non-normalized directed transfer function (NDTF) estimated effective connectivity. Principal component analysis and computation of Mahalanobis distance integrated and combined these EEG topographic markers of cortical connectivity. The area under receiver operating curve (AUC) indexed the classification accuracy. Results: A good classification of Nold and AD individuals was obtained by combining the EEG markers derived from NDTF and coherence (AUC = 86%, sensitivity = 0.85, specificity = 0.70). Conclusion: These encouraging results motivate a cross-validation study of the new procedure in ageand education-matched Nold, stable and progressing mild cognitive impairment individuals, and de novo AD patients with dementia. Significance: If cross- validated, the new procedure will provide cheap, broadly available, repeatable over time, and entirely non-invasive EEG topographic markers reflecting abnormal cortical connectivity in AD patients diagnosed by direct or indirect measurement of cerebral amyloid beta and hyperphosphorylated tau peptides.

"Chondrogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is known to be regulated by a number of environmental factors, including local oxygen levels. The hypothesis of this study is that the response of MSCs to hypoxia is dependent on the physical and chemical characteristics of the substrate used. The objective of this study was to explore how different modifications to polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds influenced the response of MSCs to hypoxia. PCL, PCL-hyaluronic acid (HA), and PCL-Bioglass (R) (BG) scaffolds were seeded with MSCs derived from bone marrow and cultured for 35 days under normoxic or low oxygen conditions, and the resulting biochemical properties of the MSC laden construct were assessed. Low oxygen tension has a positive effect over cell proliferation and macromolecules biosynthesis. Furthermore, hypoxia enhanced the distribution of collagen and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) deposition through the scaffold. On the other hand, MSCs displayed certain material dependent responses to hypoxia. Low oxygen tension had a positive effect on cell proliferation in BG and HA scaffolds, but only a positive effect on GAGs synthesis in PCL and HA scaffolds. In conclusion, hypoxia increased cell viability and expression of chondrogenic markers but the cell response was modulated by the type of scaffold used. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",15
"Objective:The monitoring of septic shock induced immunosuppression has been proposed to identify patients who could benefit from specific immunoadjuvant therapies. Among potential biomarkers to monitor immunological status, functional testing remains the gold standard because it directly measures the capacity of a cell population to respond to an immune challenge. We investigated a new approach in intracellular staining for flow cytometry to measure tumor necrosis factor (iTNF) produced in vitro by monocytes in response to lipopolysaccharide.Design, Setting, Subjects, and Interventions:Observational study in intensive care unit and immunology laboratory of a university medical center. Sixteen septic shock patients and eight control subjects were included.Main Results:Monocyte iTNF was determined by flow cytometry in whole blood and completed in 2.5h according to a no-wash, no centrifuge procedure. Lipopolysaccharide challenge induced a tremendous expression of iTNF that was statistically more pronounced in controls than in patients. This was observed when results were expressed as medians of fluorescence intensity (median: 16.1 [IQR: 14.5-19.1] vs. 5 [4.0-8.0], P=0.0001) or as percentages of positive cells (99.7 [99.6-99.8] vs. 85 [74-97], P=0.0001). iTNF expression was correlated to monocyte HLA-DR expression in patients and controls.Conclusions:These preliminary results illustrate the feasibility of immune functional testing on a routine manner in septic shock patients. They now deserve to be widely assessed and validated in various intensive care unit conditions. This could be a major step to characterize the rapidly changing immune response overtime and thus permit personalized medicine.",33
"Ethnopharmacological relevance: Plukenetia volubilis L. (Euphorbiaceae) is a domesticated vine distributed from the high-altitude Andean rain forest to the lowlands of the Peruvian Amazon. Oil from the cold-pressed seeds, sold under the commercial name of Sacha Inchi Oil (SIO) is actually much in favour because it contains a high percentage of omega 3 and omega 6, and is hence used as a dietary supplement. SIO is also used traditionally for skin care, in order to maintain skin softness, and for the treatment of wounds, insect bites and skin infections, in a tropical context where the skin is frequently damaged. Aims of the study: This study was designed in order to verify whether the traditional use of SIO for skin care would have any impact on Staphylococcus aureus growth and skin adherence, as S. aureus is involved in many skin pathologies (impetigo, folliculitis, furuncles and subcutaneous abscesses) being one if the main pathogens that can be found on the skin. Therefore, our objective was to assess SIO bactericidal activity and interference with adherence to human skin explants and the keratinocyte cell line. Cytotoxicity on that cells was also determined. The activity of SIO was compared to coconut oil (CocO), which is widely used for skin care but has different unsaturated fatty acids contents. Materials and methods: Laboratory testing with certified oil, determined antibacterial activity against radio labelled S. aureus. Cytotoxic effects were measured with XTF on keratinocyte cells and with neutral red on human skin explants; phenol was used as cytotoxic control. Adherence assays were carried out by mixing H3-labelled S. aureus bacteria with keratinocyte cells and human skin explants, incubated with oils 2 h before (to determine the inhibition of adherence, assimilated to a preventive effect) or 2 h after the contact of the biological material with S. aureus (to assess the detachment of the bacteria, assimilated to a curative effect). Residual radioactivity measured after washings made it possible to determine the adherence intensity. Bactericidal effect was determined by colony counting on trypticase soy agar. Results: Laboratory assays showed that SIO and CocO, tested undiluted, were not cytotoxic on keratinocytes nor human explants and were not bactericidal neither. SIO was more active as antiadherent (preventive) than CocO on keratinocytes. There was no significant difference between detachment effects (curative) of both oils on keratinocytes but SIO was almost 5 times more active on the detachment of S. aureus from human skin explants. Conclusion: From that study it can be concluded that the use of SIO on dermal cells is safe and efficient in the inhibition of S. aureus adherence. Our results tend to support the traditional use of undiluted SIO in skin care. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",114
"Background: Recent evidence demonstrates the benefits of integrated agriculture and nutrition programs for children's health and nutrition outcomes. These programs may also improve mothers' nutrition and empowerment outcomes. However, evidence from rigorous evaluations is scarce. Objective: We examined impacts of Helen Keller International's 2-y enhanced-homestead food production (E-HFP) program in Burkina Faso on the secondary impact measures of mothers' nutrition and empowerment. Methods: We used a cluster-randomized controlled trial whereby 55 villages with 1767 mothers of young children were randomly assigned to 3 groups: 1) control, 2) E-HFP with the behavior change communication (BCC) strategy implemented by older women leaders, or 3) E-HFP with BCC implemented by health committee members. Data for the treatment groups were pooled for this analysis because no differences were found between the 2 groups in key mothers' outcomes. We used difference-in-differences (DID) estimates to assess impacts on mothers' dietary intake, diversity, body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)), prevalence of underweight (BMI <18.5), and empowerment. Results: The E-HFP program significantly increased mothers' intake of fruit (DID = 15.8 percentage points; P = 0.02) and marginally increased their intake of meat/poultry (DID = 7.5 percentage points; P = 0.08) and dietary diversity (DID = 0.3 points; P = 0.08). The prevalence of underweight was significantly reduced among mothers in treatment compared with control villages by 8.7 percentage points (P < 0.01). Although the changes in BMI did not differ between mothers in treatment and control villages, there was a marginally significant interaction (baseline underweight X change in BMI; P-interaction = 0.07), indicating that underweight mothers had a greater increase in BMI than did mothers who were not underweight. The E-HFP program also positively affected mothers' overall empowerment score (DID = 3.13 points out of 37 possible points; P < 0.01) and 3 components of empowerment: meeting with women (DID = 1.21 points out of 5 possible points; P < 0.01), purchasing decisions (DID = 0.86 points out of 8 possible points; P = 0.01), and health care decisions (DID = 0.24 points out of 2 possible points; P = 0.05). Conclusions: Helen Keller International's E-HFP program in Burkina Faso substantially improved mothers' nutrition and empowerment outcomes. These positive impacts benefit the mothers themselves and may also improve their ability to care for their children.",117
"Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are communities of cyanobacteria, algae, microfungi, lichens and bryophytes in varying proportions, which live within or immediately on top of the uppermost millimeters of the soil in arid and semiarid regions. As biocrusts are highly relevant for ecosystem processes like carbon, nitrogen, and water cycling, a correct characterization of their spatial distribution is required. Following this objective, considerable efforts have been devoted to the identification and mapping of biocrusts using remote sensing data, and several mapping indices have been developed. However, their transferability to different regions has only rarely been tested. In this study we investigated the transferability of two multispectral indices, i.e. the Crust Index (CI) and the Biological Soil Crust Index (BSCI), and two hyperspectral indices, i.e. the Continuum Removal Crust Identification Algorithm (CRCIA) and the Crust Development Index (CDI), in three sites dominated by biocrusts, but with differences in soil and vegetation composition. Whereas multispectral indices have been important and valuable tools for first approaches to map and classify biological soil crusts, hyperspectral data and indices developed for these allowed to classify biocrusts at much higher accuracy. While multispectral indices showed Kappa (kappa) values below 0.6, hyperspectral indices obtained good classification accuracy (kappa similar to 0.8) in both the study area where they had been developed and in the newly tested region. These results highlight the capability of hyperspectral sensors to identify specific absorption features related to photosynthetic pigments as chlorophyll and carotenoids, but also the limitation of multispectral information to discriminate between areas dominated by biocrusts, vegetation or bare soil. Based on these results we conclude that remote sensing offers an important and valid tool to map biocrusts. However, the spectral similarity between the main surface components of drylands and biocrusts demand for mapping indices based on hyperspectral information to correctly map areas dominated by biocrusts at ecosystem scale.

"Background: DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism involved in gene regulation, with alterations in DNA methylation in the nuclear genome being linked to numerous complex diseases. Mitochondrial DNA methylation is a phenomenon that is receiving ever-increasing interest, particularly in diseases characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction; however, most studies have been limited to the investigation of specific target regions. Analyses spanning the entire mitochondrial genome have been limited, potentially due to the amount of input DNA required. Further, mitochondrial genetic studies have been previously confounded by nuclear-mitochondrial pseudogenes. Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation Sequencing is a technique widely used to profile DNA methylation across the nuclear genome; however, reads mapped to mitochondrial DNA are often discarded. Here, we have developed an approach to control for nuclear-mitochondrial pseudogenes within Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation Sequencing data. We highlight the utility of this approach in identifying differences in mitochondrial DNA methylation across regions of the human brain and pre-mortem blood. Results: We were able to correlate mitochondrial DNA methylation patterns between the cortex, cerebellum and blood. We identified 74 nominally significant differentially methylated regions (p < 0.05) in the mitochondrial genome, between anatomically separate cortical regions and the cerebellum in matched samples (N = 3 matched donors). Further analysis identified eight significant differentially methylated regions between the total cortex and cerebellum after correcting for multiple testing. Using unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of the mitochondrial DNA methylome, we were able to identify tissue-specific patterns of mitochondrial DNA methylation between blood, cerebellum and cortex. Conclusions: Our study represents a comprehensive analysis of the mitochondrial methylome using pre-existing Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation Sequencing data to identify brain region-specific patterns of mitochondrial DNA methylation.",72
"Background: In addition to known concerns regarding antibiotic overuse, recent research indicates that excessive antibiotic use is associated with poorer long-term health. Given that rhinosinusitis is the leading condition accounting for antibiotic prescriptions in the ambulatory setting, we aimed to evaluate characteristics associated with greater antibiotic use in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Methods: Adult CRS patients enrolled in a prospective, multi-institutional, observational cohort study evaluating treatment outcomes were included in this analysis. Study participants were asked to report the number of days out of the previous 90 days that systemic antibiotics were taken for sinus disease. Patient demographics, disease characteristics, and measures of disease severity were evaluated. Results: A total of 561 patients from 4 institutions were included in the analysis, with mean antibiotic use of 17.4 +/- 22.4 out of the prior 90 days. No differences between antibiotic-use groups were found for objective measures of disease severity (computed tomography [CT], endoscopy, Brief Smell Identification Test [BSIT] scores), however, increased patient-reported symptom burden (22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test [SNOT-22], Rhinosinusitis Disability Index [RSDI]) was associated with more antibiotic use. Patients reporting the most antibiotic use were older (p = 0.004) but no ethnic or gender differences were seen. Comorbid diagnoses of allergy, asthma, diabetes, depression, or fibromyalgia were not associated with increased antibiotic use. In accordance with literature recommendations, CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) patients were less likely to have used antibiotics. Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) significantly decreased antibiotic use. Conclusion: Variability in antibiotic use in CRS appears to be driven by symptom burden, independent of objective measures of disease severity, patient demographics, and presence of comorbid disease. Clear guidelines are essential to define appropriate antibiotic use in CRS. (C) 2017 ARS-AAOA, LLC.",109
"N-(2-Hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymers were previously found to represent a versatile delivery platform for the early detection and intervention of orthopedic implant loosening. In this article, we evaluated the impact of different structural parameters of the HPMA copolymeric system (e.g., molecular weight (MW), drug content) to its pharmacokinetics and biodistribution (PK/BD) profile. Using I-125, Alexa Fluor 488, and IRDye 800 CW-labeled HPMA copolymer-dexamethasone (P-Dex) conjugates with different MW and dexamethasone (Dex) contents, we found the MW to be the predominant impact factor on the PK/BD profiles of P-Dex, with Dex content as a secondary impact factor. In gamma counter-based PK/BD studies, increased MW of P-Dex reduced elimination, leading to lower clearance, longer half-life, and higher systemic exposure (AUC and MRT). In the semiquantitative live animal optical imaging evaluation, the distribution of P-Dex to the peri-implant inflammatory lesion increased when MW was increased. This result was further confirmed by FACS analyses of cells isolated from peri-implant regions after systemic administration of Alexa Fluor 488-labeled P-Dex. Since the in vitro cell culture study suggested that the internalization of P-Dex by macrophages is generally independent of P-Dexs MW and Dex content, the impact of the MW and Dex content on its PK/BD profile was most likely exerted at physiological and pathophysiological levels rather than at the cellular level. In both gamma counter-based PK/BD analyses and semiquantitative optical imaging analyses, P-Dex with 6 wt % Dex content showed fast clearance. Dynamic light scattering analyses unexpectedly revealed significant molecular aggregation of P-Dex at this Dex content level. The underlining mechanisms of the aggregation and fast in vivo clearance of the P-Dex warrant further investigation.",23
"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs (18-24 nucleotides (nt)) that regulate gene expression. MiRNAs exist widely in animals, plants and humans, and play fundamental roles in many biological processes, such as growth, development, differentiation and reproduction, etc. MiRNA is believed to be involved in the regulation of nearly 30% of all human genes and its expression level is closely related to some major diseases of mankind. Thus, quantitive detection and expression analysis of miRNA are significant to the understanding of functional mechanism of miRNAs, the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and the development of the correlated gene drugs, etc. MiRNA detection is mostly based on the hybridization and amplification techniques of nucleic acids, which includs northern blotting technique, microarray, in situ hybridization, real-time reverse transcription PCR, isothermal rolling circle amplification and conjugated polymer-based miRNA detection. With the discovery of miRNA in different species and the thoroughly functional research of miRNA, the detection methods have been improved continuously and the new techniques, involving amplification, labeled probe and detection, have been developed successively. This paper summarizes the progress of miRNA detection, reviews the advantages and the disadvantages of all kinds of methods and prospects the miRNA detection trends.",38
"Hatred of terrorists is an obstacle to the implementation of effective counterterrorism policies-it invites indiscriminate retaliation, whereas many of the greatest successes in counterterrorism have come from understanding terrorists' personal and political motivations. Drawing from psychological research, traditional prejudice reduction strategies are generally not well suited to the task of reducing hatred of terrorists. Instead, in 2 studies, we explored education's potential ability to reduce extreme negative attitudes toward terrorists. Study 1 compared students in a college course on terrorism (treatment) with wait-listed students, measuring prosocial attitudes toward a hypothetical terrorist. Initially, all students reported extremely negative attitudes; however, at the end of the semester, treatment students' attitudes were significantly improved. Study 2 replicated the effect within a sample of treatment and control classes drawn from universities across the United States. The present work was part of an ongoing research project, focusing on foreign policy and the perceived threat of terrorism; thus classes did not explicitly aim to reduce prejudice, making the effect of treatment somewhat surprising. One possibility is that learning about terrorists ""crowds out"" the initial pejorative associations-that is, the label terrorism may ultimately call more information to mind, diluting its initial negative associative links. Alternatively, students may learn to challenge how the label terrorist is being applied. In either case, learning about terrorism can decrease the extreme negative reactions it evokes, which is desirable if one wishes to implement effective counterterrorism policies.",61
"In Asia, two wheelers are popular mode of transportation to a large group of people because of their relative affordability and ability to maneuver in heavy city traffic. However, the rate of fuel consumption and emission contribution by them, especially in urban areas need more attention to improve sustain ability of energy and air quality. Recently, plug-in hybrid technology has been emerged as one of the most promising alternatives in reducing petroleum consumption and emission. This paper presents the implementation of plug-in hybrid technology on a two wheeler by formulation of novel control strategy suitable for Indian city driving needs. Experimental investigations on hub motor and IC (internal combustion) engine has been carried out to fix the change-over speed in hybrid mode, followed by road test on prototype vehicle. The performance of prototype vehicle on IDC (Indian driving cycle) simulated road pattern and actual road driving, confirmed the change-over speed of vehicle in hybrid mode. The converted plug-in hybrid electric two wheeler also demonstrated the drive strategy adopted for higher energy efficiency up to 2.5 times. So, plug-in hybrid electric two wheelers show significant improvements in fuel economy by replacing petroleum fuel with electricity for portions of trip to achieve nations' energy security.

"Dynamic nature of mobile ad hoc networks combined with their lack of centralized infrastructure make security problem the most challenging issue in such networks. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a secure and efficient key management algorithm, able to satisfying the requirement of such networks and facing their specific characteristics. The proposed algorithm is a fully distributed ID-based system which is built based on elliptic curve cryptography. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm, that gives it the superiority in its field of research, is the improvement of the performance and the security strength together. The proposed algorithm is implemented with much lower communication and computation overhead in comparison with its literature works. It is also able to update the keys while it solves the key escrowing problem. It is analyzed analytically and compared with several recently proposed key management algorithms. The analysis shows the superiority of the proposed algorithm in comparison with others. Furthermore, NS2 simulator is used to do exhaustive simulations. Simulation scenarios are done for large scale networks, to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and also validate the analytical results. Results show that our algorithm could provide confidentiality, integrity, authentication and non-repudiation with order of magnitude less computation and communication overhead in comparison with former works.

"Several researchers around the world have studied gesture recognition, but most of the recent techniques fall in the curse of dimensionality and are not useful in real time environment. This study proposes a system for dynamic gesture recognition and prediction using an innovative feature extraction technique, called the Convexity Approach. The proposed method generates a smaller feature vector to describe the hand shape with a minimal amount of data. For dynamic gesture recognition and prediction, the system implements two independent modules based on Hidden Markov Models and Dynamic Time Warping. Two experiments, one for gesture recognition and another for prediction, are executed in two different datasets, the RPPDI Dynamic Gestures Dataset and the Cambridge Hand Data, and the results are showed and discussed.

"This study was aimed to describe changes of Disease-Modifying Treatments (DMT) in an Italian cohort of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and to identify predictors of therapeutic modifications. Patients with MS and treated with the first-line injectable DMT (interferons-IFNs or glatiramer) between 1/7/2009 and 31/10/2012 were selected from administrative databases of the MS Center of Cagliari (Sardinia, Italy). Socio-demographic, therapeutic, and clinical information was collected in the 6 months preceding the index date. All patients were followed for 36 months to evaluate therapeutic changes in terms of non-adherence, switch, temporary discontinuation, and permanent interruption. Predictors of changes were estimated by multivariable regression models. Data on 1698 patients were collected: glatiramer was prescribed in 27% of cases, IFN beta-1b in 22%, IFN beta-1a-im in 20%, IFN beta-1a-sc-44mcg in 19%, and IFN beta-1a-sc-22mcg in 12%. Non-adherence was observed in 25% of cases, therapeutic switch in 30%, discontinuation in 37%, and permanent interruption in 28%. The risk of non-adherence was higher for IFN beta-1b, compared with IFN beta-1a-im (adjOR = 1.73). Therapeutic switch occurred especially in patients recently diagnosed (each year from diagnosis causes a decrease of this risk adjHR = 0.97); the risk of discontinuation was higher with EDSS = 4-6 and 7-9 (adjHR = 1.52 and 4.42, respectively). The risk of permanent interruption increased with the augmentation of disability (adjHR = 1.67 and 5.43 for EDSS 4-6 and 7-9). This study mirrored a detailed framework of DMT prescription and identified factors related to changes in the MS therapy. These findings could support healthcare providers in the evaluation and maximization of benefits associated with a long-term DMT.",11
"Objective: The properties of self-renewal and division in spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) support spermatogenesis. There is a number of reported methods for in vitro SSC culture systems. The development of a culture system that effectively supports isolation and self-renewal of germline stem cells (GSCs) is of tremendous benefit for clinical trials, experimental research, and as potential treatment for male infertility. The current study aims to consider the cultivation and behavior of GSCs in a non-adherent culture system. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, we cultured testicular cells from neonatal mice in agarose coated plates in the presence of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) medium (CTRL group), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)+DMEM (10% group), and growth factor (G group) that contained 2% FBS, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Mouse spermatogonial stem-like colonies were isolated approximately 3 weeks after digestion of the testis tissue. After passages 2-3, the identity of the mouse spermatogonial stem-like cells was confirmed by immunocytochemistry, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and flow cytometry against the germ cell markers alpha 6, beta 1, c-Kit, Thy-1, c-Ret, Plzf, and Oct4. The statistical significance between mean values in different groups was determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: We observed spermatogonial stem-like colonies in the G and 10% groups, but not the CTRL group. Immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, and RT-PCR confirmed expressions of germ cell markers in these cells. In the spermatogonial stem-like cells, we observed a significant expression (P<0.05) of germ cell markers in the G and 10% groups versus the testis cells (T). Their proliferative and apoptotic activities were examined by Ki67 and PI/annexin V-FITC. Alkaline phosphatase assay showed that mouse spermatogonial stem-like colonies were partially positive. Conclusion: A non-adherent culture system could provide a favorable method for in vitro short-term culture of spermatogonial stem-like cell colonies.",37
"Resonate and Fire (R+F) models were introduced to account for many phenomena occurring in biological neurons showing sub-threshold oscillations of the membrane potential. In information technology, they are at the basis of Chaotic Spiking Oscillators (CSOs), exploitable in Pulse Coupled Neural Networks (PCNNs). This paper illustrates how the R+F paradigm can also be used for the testing of analog signal processing structures (and specifically filters), extending the Oscillation Based Test (OBT) framework. The rich dynamics of the R+F model is used to encode the block under test features and faults into pulse trains directly processable at the digital level. Means to achieve a precise characterization of firing times are provided and used for parametric testing. Considerations about the trade-off between testing times and accuracy are provided together with a practical example and simulation data. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",52
"Proteins are one of the most versatile modular assembling systems in nature. Experimentally, more than 110 000 protein structures have been identified and more are deposited every day in the Protein Data Bank. Such an enormous structural variety is to a first approximation controlled by the sequence of amino acids along the peptide chain of each protein. Understanding how the structural and functional properties of the target can be encoded in this sequence is the main objective of protein design. Unfortunately, rational protein design remains one of the major challenges across the disciplines of biology, physics and chemistry. The implications of solving this problem are enormous and branch into materials science, drug design, evolution and even cryptography. For instance, in the field of drug design an effective computational method to design protein-based ligands for biological targets such as viruses, bacteria or tumour cells, could give a significant boost to the development of new therapies with reduced side effects. In materials science, self-assembly is a highly desired property and soon artificial proteins could represent a new class of designable self-assembling materials. The scope of this review is to describe the state of the art in computational protein design methods and give the reader an outline of what developments could be expected in the near future.",57
"Two circuit solutions of a fully differential current-mode band-pass filter are presented in this paper. The main feature of these circuits is that the quality factor Q can be electronically adjusted independently of the natural frequency omega(0) via single active element, namely the digitally adjustable current amplifier (DACA). The Q-control is directly or indirectly proportional to the current gain of the DACA depending on the circuit structure used. The behavior of the proposed structures has been verified by Spice simulations.",52
"Background: Combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE) is increasingly acknowledged as a separate syndrome with distinct clinical, physiological and radiological characteristics. We sought to identify physiologic and radiographic indices that predict mortality in CPFE. Methods: Data on clinical characteristics, pulmonary function, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and treatment were compared between patients with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) plus emphysema (CPFE group) and those with IPF alone (IPF group). Composite physiologic index (CPI) and HRCT scores at diagnosis and during follow-up were assessed. Results: CPFE group (N = 87) was characterized by the predominance of males and smokers, who were less likely to have viral infection prior to the diagnosis, and display basal crackles, finger clubbing and wheeze, as compared to that in the IPF group (N = 105). HRCT and CPI scores increased over time in both groups. Moreover, CPFE group had a poorer prognosis, lower 5-year survival rate (43.42 % vs. 65.56 %; P= 5-point increase in CPI score per year were predictors of mortality in the CPFE group (hazard ratio [HR]: 10.29, 95 % Confidence Interval [CI]: 2.69-39.42 and HR: 21.60, 95 % CI: 7.28-64.16, respectively). Conclusion: Patients with CPFE were predominantly male and smokers and exhibited distinct clinical, physiological and radiographic characteristics. They had a poorer prognosis than IPF. PAH and >= 5-point increase in CPI score per year were predictors of mortality in these patients. Future studies are needed to identify the optimal treatment approach to CPFE.",3
"Apart from being able to support the bulk of student activity in suitable disciplines such as computer programming, Web-based educational systems have the potential to yield valuable insights into student behavior. Through the use of educational analytics, we can dispense with preconceptions of how students consume and reuse course material. In this paper, we examine the speed at which students employ concepts which they are being taught during a semester. To show the wider utility of this data, we present a basic classification system for early detection of poor performers and show how it can be improved by including data on when students use a concept for the first time. Using our improved classifier, we can achieve an accuracy of 85% in predicting poor performers prior to the completion of the course.",40

"PurposeMental Health First Aid (MHFA), an early intervention training program for general audiences, has been promoted as a means for improving population-level behavioral health (BH) in rural communities by encouraging treatment-seeking. This study examined MHFA's appropriateness and impacts in rural contexts. MethodsWe used a mixed-methods approach to study MHFA trainings conducted from November 2012 through September 2013 in rural communities across the country. Data Sources: (a) posttraining questionnaires completed by 44,273 MHFA participants at 2,651 rural and urban trainings in 50 US states; (b) administrative data on these trainings; and (c) interviews with 16 key informants who had taught, sponsored, or participated in rural MHFA. Measure of Rurality: Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes. Analyses: Chi-square tests were conducted on questionnaire data. Structural, descriptive, and pattern coding techniques were used to analyze interview data. FindingsMHFA appears aligned with some key rural needs. MHFA may help to reduce unmet need for BH treatment in rural communities by raising awareness of BH issues and mitigating stigma, thereby promoting appropriate treatment-seeking. However, rural infrastructure deficits may limit some communities' ability to meet new demand generated by MHFA. MHFA may help motivate rural communities to develop initiatives for strengthening infrastructure, but additional tools and consultation may be needed. ConclusionsThis study provides preliminary evidence that MHFA holds promise for improving rural BH. MHFA alone cannot compensate for weaknesses in rural BH infrastructure.",125
"This paper proposes a new hybrid metaheuristique algorithm based on the hybridization of Biogeography-based optimization with the Differential Evolution for solving the optimal power flow problem with emission control. The biogeography-based optimization (BBO) algorithm is strongly influenced by equilibrium theory of island biogeography, mainly through two steps: Migration and Mutation. Differential Evolution (DE) is one of the best Evolutionary Algorithms for global optimization. The hybridization of these two methods is used to overcome traps of local optimal solutions and problems of time consumption. The objective of this paper is to minimize the total fuel cost of generation, total emission, total real power loss and also maintain an acceptable system performance in terms of limits on generator real power, bus voltages and power flow of transmission lines. In the present work, BBO/DE has been applied to solve the optimal power flow problems on IEEE 30-bus test system and the Algerian electrical network 114 bus. The results obtained from this method show better performances compared with DE, BBO and other well known metaheuristique and evolutionary optimization methods.",50
"This study addresses the relationship between various family forms and the level of cognitive and non-cognitive skills among 15- to 16-year-old students. We measure cognitive skills using standardized scores in mathematics; non-cognitive abilities are captured by a composite measure of internal locus of control related to mathematics. A particular focus lies on father absence although we also examine the role played by co-residence with siblings and grandparents. We use cross-nationally comparable data on students participating in the Programme for International Student Assessment's release for 2012. By mapping inequalities by family forms across 33 developed countries, this study provides robust cross-country comparable evidence on the relationship of household structure with both cognitive and non-cognitive skills. The study produces three key results: first, the absence of fathers from the household as well as co-residence with grandparents is associated with adverse outcomes for children in virtually all developed countries. Second, this is generally true in terms of both cognitive and non-cognitive skills, although the disadvantage connected to both family forms is notably stronger in the former than in the latter domain. Finally, there is marked cross-national diversity in the effects associated with the presence in the household of siblings and especially grandparents which furthermore differs across the two outcomes considered.",125
"Although patients with lower urinary tract symptoms constitute a large and still growing population, understanding of bladder detrusor muscle physiology remains limited. Understanding the interactions between the detrusor smooth muscle cells and other bladder cell types (e.g. interstitial cells, IC) that may significantly contribute to coordinating and modulating detrusor contractions represents a considerable challenge. Computer modeling could help to elucidate some properties that are difficult to address experimentally; therefore, we developed in silico models of detrusor smooth muscle cell and interstitial cells, coupled through gap junctions. The models include all of the major ion conductances and transporters described in smooth muscle cell and interstitial cells in the literature. The model of normal detrusor muscle (smooth muscle cell and interstitial cells coupled through gap junctions) completely reproduced the experimental results obtained with detrusor strips in the presence of several pharmacological interventions (ryanodine, caffeine, nimodipine), whereas the model of smooth muscle cell alone (without interstitial cells) failed to reproduce the experimental results. Next, a model of overactive bladder, a highly prevalent clinical condition in both men and women with increasing incidence at older ages, was produced by modifying several processes as reported previously: a reduction of Ca2+-release through ryanodine receptors and a reduction of Ca2+-dependent K+-conductance with augmented gap junctional coupling. This model was also able to reproduce the pharmacological modulation of overactive bladder. In conclusion, a model of bladder detrusor muscle was developed that reproduced experimental results obtained in both normal and overactive bladder preparations. The results indicate that the non-smooth muscle cells of the detrusor (interstitial cells) contribute significantly to the contractile behavior of bladder detrusor muscle and should not be neglected. The model suggests that reduced Ca2+-release through ryanodine receptors and Ca2+-dependent K+-conductance together with augmented gap junctional coupling might play a major role in overactive bladder pathogenesis.",17
"Model-Based Development has become an industry wide standard paradigm. As an open source alternative, Scilab/Xcos is being widely employed as a hybrid dynamic systems modeling tool. With the increasing efficiency in implementation using graphical model development and code generation, the modeling and simulation community is struggling with assuring quality as well as maintainability and extendibility. Refactoring is defined as an evolutionary modernization activity where, most of the time, the structure of the artifact is changed to alter its quality characteristics, while keeping its behavior unchanged. It has been widely established as a technique for textual programming languages to improve the code structure and quality. While refactoring is also regarded as one of the key practices of model engineering, the methodologies and approaches for model refactoring are still under development. Architecture-Driven Modernization (ADM) has been introduced by the software engineering community as a model-based approach to software modernization, in which the implicit information that lies in software artifacts is extracted to models and model transformations are applied for modernization tasks. Regarding refactoring as a low level modernization task, the practices from ADM are adaptable. Accordingly, this paper proposes a model-based approach for model refactoring in order to come up with more efficient and effective model refactoring methodology that is accessible and extendable by modelers. Like other graphical modeling tools, Scilab/Xcos also possesses a formalized model specification conforming to its implicit metamodel. Rather than proposing another metamodel for knowledge extraction, this pragmatic approach proposes to conduct in place model-to-model transformations for refactoring employing the Scilab/Xcos model specification. To construct a structured model-based approach, the implicit Scilab/Xcos metamodel is explicitly presented utilizing ECORE as a meta-metamodel. Then a practical model transformation approach is established based on Scilab scripting. A Scilab toolset is provided to the modeler for in-place model-to-model transformations. Using a sample case study, it is demonstrated that proposed model transformation functions in Scilab provide a valuable refactoring tool.",123
"Background/Purpose: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are accepted as the gold standard for assessing the effectiveness of clinical interventions but are rarely reported in pediatric surgery. Have RCTs submitted to the British Association of Paediatric Surgeons (BAPS) Annual Congress during the last 5 years been adequately designed and large enough to produce a valid result? Methods: Abstracts accepted by the Annual BAPS Congress meetings between 1996 and 2000 were examined in collaboration with a senior health services researcher. The quality of the design, methodology, statistical analysis and conclusions, and the adequacy of the sample size were assessed for all identifiable clinical RCTs. Results: From 760 accepted abstracts, there were only 9 RCTs (1%) of clinical interventions. In only 4 trials was the relevant primary end-point specified at the outset of the study, and none documented the method of randomization. Only one abstract mentioned blinding with respect to the intervention or outcome measure. Sample sizes were inadequate to detect even large clinical differences. To date, only one of these RCTs has been published in an English-language, peer-reviewed journal. Conclusions: Clear guidelines exist for the conduct of RCTs, yet compliance with these standards was rarely documented in abstracts of pediatric surgical RCTs presented at BAPS. Sample sizes were inadequate. RCTs in pediatric surgery are difficult to perform, but the specialty would benefit from well-designed, carefully conducted, multicentre, clinical RCTs to advance evidence-based practice.

"Intensive economic and shipping activities in Singapore Strait have caused Singapore coastal waters to be under high risk of water pollution. A nested three-dimensional unstructured-grid SUNTANS model is applied to Singapore coastal waters to simulate flow and pollutant transport. The small domain (similar to 50 m resolution) Singapore coastal model is nested within a large domain (similar to 200 m resolution) regional model. The nested model is able to predict water surface elevations and velocities with high R-2 values of 0.96 and 0.91, respectively. Model results delineate the characteristics of circulation pattern in Singapore coastal waters during the Northeast and Southwest monsoons. The pollutants are modeled as passive tracers, and are released at six key sailing locations Points 1-6 in Singapore coastal waters and are named as Passive Tracers 1-6, respectively. Our results show that the rate of dispersionis twice as large for the Northeast monsoon compared to the Southwest monsoon due to differences in large-scale monsoons and small-scale local winds. The volume averaged concentration (VAC) diminishes faster and the local flushing time is shorter during the Northeast monsoon than the Southwest monsoon. Dispersion coefficients K and the VAC decreasing rate are maximum for Tracers 2 and 3 with shortest local flushing time due to the strong surrounding currents and abrupt bathymetry changes near Senang and St. John Islands. Dispersion coefficients K and the VAC decreasing rate are minimum for Tracer 1 due to weak currents induced by the semi-enclosed coastline near Tuas. It is found that both the lateral dispersion coefficient K-y and the compound dispersion coefficient K obey a ""4/3-law"", which defines a linear correlation between dispersion coefficients and 4/3-power of selected length scale.

"Reverse unknown protocol's hidden behavior has played an important role in the field of network security. The proposed work takes the captured messages and the binary code that implement the protocol both as the studied object. Dynamic Taint Analysis combined with Static Analysis is used for protocol analyzing. Firstly, monitor and analyze the process of protocol program parses the message in the virtual platform HiddenDisc prototype system developed by ourselves, record the protocol's public behavior, then based on our proposed Hidden Behavior Perception and Mining algorithm, static analyze the protocol's hidden behavior trigger conditions and hidden behavior instruction sequences. According to the hidden behavior trigger conditions, new protocol messages with the sensitive information are generated, and the hidden behaviors are executed by dynamic triggering. HiddenDisc prototype system can sense, trigger and analyze the protocol's hidden behaviors. According to the statistical analysis results, we propose the evaluation method of Protocol Execution Security. The experimental results show that the present method can accurately mining the protocol's hidden behaviors, and can evaluate unknown protocol's execution security.",46
"We have put into practice the flipped classroom as a way of utilizing e-learning contents in our computer-programming course since 2013. The main feature of this practice is to use most of the time usually dedicated to lecture for practicing by assigning the students the e-learning materials as preparation before the class. We gave the students homework to learn vocabularies and grammar of the C programming language. This decreased the time a teacher spent lecturing and the students were assigned applied-problems to make practical software in addition to conventional basic problems in training. Our goal is to maintain the students' motivation to learn the computer programming through the sense of accomplishment that each student obtains by finishing practical assignments in the training. We confirmed the effectiveness of this approach by comparing examination scores between last year and this year, and putting questionnaires to the students. Additionally, we analyzed the learning situation of the students who were week in programming. The results are shown in this paper.",40
"Research suggests that humans have an attentional bias for the rapid detection of emotionally valenced stimuli, and that such a bias might be shaped by clinical psychological states. The current research extends this work to examine the relation between body dissatisfaction and an attentional bias for thin/idealized body shapes. Across two experiments, undergraduates completed a gender-consistent body dissatisfaction measure, and a dot-probe paradigm to measure attentional biases for thin versus heavy bodies. Results indicated that men (n = 21) and women (n = 18) show an attentional bias for bodies that correspond to their own gender (Experiment 1), and that high body dissatisfaction among men (n = 69) and women (n = 89) predicts an attentional bias for thin same-gender bodies after controlling for body mass index (BMI) (Experiment 2). This research provides a new direction for studying the attentional and cognitive underpinnings of the relation between body dissatisfaction and eating disorders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Background.-Migraine is a common cause of headache in childhood. Several studies have investigated the association between migraine and atopic diseases, mostly in the adult population. Objective.-This study aimed to investigate this association in children. Methods.-A case-control study was conducted across 3 European tertiary care hospitals between June 2014 and August 2014. Cases (n = 229) were children aged 6-18 years consulting for a migraine episode. Controls in the same age range (n = 406) were consulting for a minor injury and did not have a history of recurrent headache. Logistic regression analyses tested the effect of atopic diseases and anti-allergic therapies on occurrence of migraine. Results.-Children with migraine were more likely to have persistent asthma compared to absence of asthma (odds ratio [OR]: 4.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.04-10.24) and less likely to have been treated by inhaled or nasal corticosteroid (OR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.15-0.76) or antihistamine therapy (OR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.18-0.60). The median number of monthly migraine episodes was higher in children with persistent asthma (3; interquartile [IQR]: 1-4; range: 0.5-10) compared to children with intermittent asthma (2; IQR: 1-3; range: 0.1-4) or non-asthmatic children (2; IQR: 1-3; range: 0.1-12) (P<.01). Conclusion.-Persistent childhood asthma was associated with increased risk of migraine and higher frequency of migraine attacks. History of anti-asthmatic or anti-allergic therapies was associated with decreased risk of migraine in children and adolescents. The role of these therapies on the pathogenesis and occurrence of migraine needs to be further elucidated because of the huge potential impact in terms of public health.",109
"The present study examined the moderating effect of cigarette smoking status on the relation between anxiety sensitivity (fear of the expected negative consequences of anxiety and bodily sensations) and hazardous alcohol consumption, sexual compulsivity, and suicidality. A series of multiple hierarchical regressions were used to test the proposed hypothesis among a sample of 94 persons living with HIV/AIDS in the USA (64.5 % male, M (age) = 48.3, SD = 7.5). Fifty-seven percent of the participants (n = 54) reported past-month smoking. The results indicated that those who reported smoking and had higher anxiety sensitivity demonstrated the highest rates of hazardous alcohol use, sexual compulsivity, and suicidality. Simple slope analyses indicated that anxiety sensitivity was associated with higher rates of hazardous alcohol use, sexual compulsivity, and suicidality among individuals who reported past-month smoking, but not among individuals who did not smoke. The present results suggest that smoking status moderates the relation between anxiety sensitivity and hazardous alcohol use, sexual compulsivity, and suicidality among persons living with HIV/AIDS. These data add to a growing literature, suggesting that smoking has a negative impact among persons living with HIV/AIDS, which extends beyond physical health problems to a variety of clinically significant behavioral health sequelae.",132
"Background: A major challenge of bioinformatics in the era of precision medicine is to identify the molecular biomarkers for complex diseases. It is a general expectation that these biomarkers or signatures have not only strong discrimination ability, but also readable interpretations in a biological sense. Generally, the conventional expressionbased or network-based methods mainly capture differential genes or differential networks as biomarkers, however, such biomarkers only focus on phenotypic discrimination and usually have less biological or functional interpretation. Meanwhile, the conventional function-based methods could consider the biomarkers corresponding to certain biological functions or pathways, but ignore the differential information of genes, i. e., disregard the active degree of particular genes involved in particular functions, thereby resulting in less discriminative ability on phenotypes. Hence, it is strongly demanded to develop elaborate computational methods to directly identify functional network biomarkers with both discriminative power on disease states and readable interpretation on biological functions. Results: In this paper, we present a new computational framework based on an integer programming model, named as Comparative Network Stratification (CNS), to extract functional or interpretable network biomarkers, which are of strongly discriminative power on disease states and also readable interpretation on biological functions. In addition, CNS can not only recognize the pathogen biological functions disregarded by traditional Expression-based/ Networkbased methods, but also uncover the active network-structures underlying such dysregulated functions underestimated by traditional Function-based methods. To validate the effectiveness, we have compared CNS with five state-of-the-art methods, i. e. GSVA, Pathifier, stSVM, frSVM and AEP on four datasets of different complex diseases. The results show that CNS can enhance the discriminative power of network biomarkers, and further provide biologically interpretable information or disease pathogenic mechanism of these biomarkers. A case study on type 1 diabetes (T1D) demonstrates that CNS can identify many dysfunctional genes and networks previously disregarded by conventional approaches. Conclusion: Therefore, CNS is actually a powerful bioinformatics tool, which can identify functional or interpretable network biomarkers with both discriminative power on disease states and readable interpretation on biological functions. CNS was implemented as a Matlab package, which is available at http://www.sysbio.ac.cn/cb/chenlab/images/ CNSpackage_0.1.rar.",42
"This paper presents the design of an innovative device that applies dynamic mechanical load to human knee joints. Dynamic loading is employed by applying cyclic and periodic force on a target area. The repeated force loading was considered to be an effective modality for repair and rehabilitation of long bones that are subject to ailments like fractures, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, etc. The proposed device design builds on the knowledge gained in previous animal and mechanical studies. It employs a modified slider-crank linkage mechanism actuated by a brushless Direct Current (DC) motor and provides uniform and cyclic force. The functionality of the device was simulated in a software environment and the structural integrity was analyzed using a finite element method for the prototype construction. The device is controlled by a microcontroller that is programmed to provide the desired loading force at a predetermined frequency and for a specific duration. The device was successfully tested in various experiments for its usability and full functionality. The results reveal that the device works according to the requirements of force magnitude and operational frequency. This device is considered ready to be used for a clinical study to examine whether controlled knee-loading could be an effective regimen for treating the stated bone-related ailments.",51
"Phosphatidylethanolamine is one of the most abundant phospholipids whose major amounts are formed by phosphatidylserine decarboxylases (PO). Here we provide a comprehensive description of different types of PSDs in the different kingdoms of life. In eukaryotes, type I PSDs are mitochondrial enzymes, whereas other PSDs are localized to other cellular compartments. We describe the role of mitochondrial Psd1 proteins, their function, enzymology, biogenesis, assembly into mitochondria and their contribution to phospholipid homeostasis in much detail. We also discuss briefly the cellular physiology and the enzymology of Psd2. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Lipids of Mitochondria edited by Guenther Daum.

"A hybrid solar-biomass fluidized bed drying system was designed, evaluated and developed. The system was comprised of a fluidized bed, a solar collector, and a biomass furnace. This solar-assisted fluidized bed dryer integrated biomass furnace was used to investigated the drying kinetics of paddy. The average temperature of the air drying were 61 and 78 degrees C. The paddy's moisture content was dried to 14% from 20% (wet basis) with a mass flow rate of 0.125 kg/s. The performance of the fluidized bed drying system was assessed base on energy and exergy analyses. The specific energy consumption (SEC), solar fractions, biomass fractions, thermal and exergy efficiencies were obtained. The SEC and drying times were lower in hybrid solar-biomass fluidized bed drying system compared to solar dryers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",100
"Political and economical changes from the few past years had significant influence over almost all countries economical life. High-developed countries react after these changes in marketing by using high-performance working methods and by raising investments in researching fields. The world competitive manufactures attention in the last years is on the competitive and environment-friendly products development. For that there has been adopted the concept of integrated manufacturing as a strategy, for achieving shorter time to market, reduced development costs, and high quality products.

"The digital low dropout regulator (D-LDO) has drawn significant attention recently for its low-voltage operation and process scalability. However, the tradeoff between current efficiency and transient response speed has limited its applications. In this brief, a coarse-fine-tuning technique with burst-mode operation is proposed to the D-LDO. Once the voltage undershoot/overshoot is detected, the coarse tuning quickly finds out the coarse control word in which the load current should be located, with large power MOS strength and high sampling frequency for a fixed time. Then, the fine-tuning, with reduced power MOS strength and sampling frequency, regulates the D-LDO to the desired output voltage and takes over the steady-state operation for high accuracy and current efficiency. The proposed D-LDO is verified in a 65-nm CMOS process with a 0.01-mm(2) active area. The measured voltage undershoot and overshoot are 55 and 47 mV, respectively, with load steps of 2 to 100 mA with a 20-ns edge time. The quiescent current is 82 mu A, with a 0.43-ps figure of merit achieved. Moreover, the reference tracking speed is 1.5 V/mu s.",48
"Objective: Symptoms of sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) have been considered a potential subset of symptoms of ADHD, predominantly inattentive presentation (ADHD-I), or as a separate but related symptom dimension. We sought to characterize the relationships between SCT and both internalizing symptoms and executive functioning in adults with ADHD. Method: One hundred two adults diagnosed with ADHD completed clinical interviews and clinical rating scales. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to ascertain the independent predictive power of SCT symptoms for executive dysfunction after considering ADHD inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms and internalizing symptoms. Results: SCT was correlated with ADHD inattentive symptoms and dimensional measures of depression and anxiety symptoms, but not with clinical diagnosis of depression or anxiety disorder. SCT was independently predictive of executive function deficits over and above the effects of internalizing and ADHD symptoms. Conclusion: SCT in adults is associated with internalizing symptoms, ADHD inattentive symptoms, and, independently, with executive function deficits, particularly organization and problem solving.

"Task allocation problems have traditionally focused on cost optimization. However, more and more attention is being given to cases in which cost should not always be the sole or major consideration. In this paper we study a fair task allocation problem in transportation where an optimal allocation not only has low cost but more importantly, it distributes tasks as even as possible among heterogeneous participants who have different capacities and costs to execute tasks. To tackle this fair minimum cost allocation problem we analyze and solve it in two parts using two novel polynomial-time algorithms. We show that despite the new fairness criterion, the proposed algorithms can solve the fair minimum cost allocation problem optimally in polynomial-time. In addition, we conduct an extensive set of experiments to investigate the trade-off between cost minimization and fairness. Our experimental results demonstrate the benefit of factoring fairness into task allocation. Among the majority of test instances, fairness comes with a very small price in terms of cost.

"Applications of advanced control algorithms are important in the refrigeration field to achieve low-energy costs and accurate set-point tracking. However, the designing and tuning of control systems depend on dynamic mathematical models. Approaches like analytical modeling can be time-consuming because they usually lead to a large number of differential equations with unknown parameters. In this work, the application of system identification with the fast recursive orthogonal least square (FROLS) algorithm is proposed as an alternative to analytical modeling to develop a process dynamic model. The evaporating temperature (EVT), condensing temperature (CDT) and useful superheat (USH) are the outputs of interest for this system; covariance analysis of the candidate inputs shows that the model should be single-input-single-output (SISO). Good simulation results are obtained with two different validation data, with average output errors of 0.0343 (EVT model), 0.0079 (CDT model) and 0.1578 (USH model) for one of the datasets, showing that this algorithm is a valid alternative for modeling refrigeration systems.",49
"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Tobacco use remains the single most important preventable cause of cancer and is responsible for 80% of all cases of lung cancer. Implementation of tobacco control measures, including preventing initiation and treating dependence, are pivotal to address the lung cancer epidemic.

Evidence and guidelines on how to implement these strategies exist and present an opportunity for nurses to make a difference in reducing suffering and preventing deaths from lung cancer.",104
"To identify genes expression in Chenopodium album exposed to NaCl stress and screen ESTs related to salt stress, a subtractive suppression hybridization (SSH) library of C. album under salt stress was constructed in the present study. Random EST sequencing produced 825 high-quality ESTs with GenBank ID GE746311-GE747007, which had 301 bp of average size and were clustered into 88 contigs and 550 singletons. They were classified into 12 categories according to their function annotations. 635 ESTs (76.97%) showed similarities to gene sequences in the non-redundancy database, while 190 ESTs (23.03%) showed low or no similarities. The transcriptional profiles of 56 ESTs randomly selected from 347 unknown or novel ESTs of SSH library under varying NaCl concentration and at different time points were analyzed. The results indicated that a high proportion of tested ESTs were activated by salt stress. Four in 56 ESTs responded to NaCl were also enhanced in expression level when exposed to ABA and PEG stresses. The above four ESTs were validated by northern blotting which was consistent with the results of RT-PCR. The results suggested that genes corresponded to these ESTs might be involved in stress response or regulation. The complete sequences and detailed function of these ESTs need to be further studied.",38
"TP53 gene mutations occurring in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are associated with high-risk karyotypes including 17p abnormalities, monosomal and complex cytogenetics. TP53 mutations in these disorders portend rapid disease progression and resistance to conventional therapeutics. Notably, the size of the TP53 mutant clone as measured by mutation allele burden is directly linked to overall survival (OS) confirming the importance of p53 as a negative prognostic variable. In nucleolar stress-induced ribosomopathies, such as del(5q) MDS, disassociation of MDM2 and p53 results in p53 accumulation in erythroid precursors manifested as erythroid hypoplasia. P53 antagonism by lenalidomide or other therapeutics such as antisense oligonucleotides, repopulates erythroid precursors and enhances effective erythropoiesis. These findings demonstrate that p53 is an intriguing therapeutic target that is currently under investigation in MDS and AML. This study reviews molecular advances in understanding the role of p53 in MDS and AML, and explores potential therapeutic strategies in this era of personalized medicine.",14
"The increase in authorship of nuclear physics publications has been investigated using the large statistical samples. Large collections of bibliographical metadata represent a very powerful tool for understanding of the past, present, and, perhaps, future research trends. This has been accomplished with nuclear data mining of nuclear science references and the experimental nuclear reaction databases. The data analysis shows a strong anticorrelation between authorship increase of experimental papers and overall reduction of measurements due to closures of many small nuclear physics facilities. These findings suggest that article authorship is a very complex phenomenon, and presently-observed increase or ""inflation"" in authorship could be explained by the adaptation to the changing research environment, in addition to the evolving authorship rules that progressed over the years from very strict to lenient. The results of this study and their implications are discussed and conclusions presented.",112
"A potential consequence of chemotherapy is the destruction of oocytes, resulting in primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) in young patients; this often results in secondary amenorrhea and necessitates hormone replacement therapy. Regardless of the etiology of POI, the chance of pregnancy is low in this patient population. Given the extent to which oocyte depletion or dysfunction is variable, there is the possibility of spontaneous ovulation on hormone replacement therapy and subsequent pregnancy, however. If pregnancy is not desired, contraception always should be discussed. In most patients, the etiology of POI will not be known, but the treatment for all patients includes estrogen and progesterone therapy, which ensures the development of secondary sex characteristics, acquisition of peak bone mass, and promotion of uterine growth and maturation. Early diagnosis, patient education, and emotional support are important to mitigate long-term sequelae.",9
"Medicinal plants have been widely used for a long history. Exploration of pharmacologically active compounds from medicinal plants present a broad prevalent of application. By examining viral mRNA expression in GCRV-infected Ctenopharyngodon idella kidney (CIK) cells treated with thirty kinds of plant extracts, we identified Magnolia officinalis Rehd et Wils. was able to preferably suppress viral replication. Further studies demonstrated that the main ingredients of magnolia bark, namely, magnolol and honokiol presented protective pharmacological function when treated GCRV-infected CIK cells with a concentration of 2.00 mu g/ml and 1.25 mu g/ml, respectively. Furthermore, reverse transcript quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot showed that both magnolol and honokiol were efficient to restrain the replication of GCRV in CIK cells at non-toxic concentration (2.51 0.51 pg/ml for magnolol, and 3.18 +/- 0.61 mu g/ml for honokiol). Moreover, it was found that magnolol and honokiol promoted the expression of immune-related genes. Magnolol obviously significantly increased the expression of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor (IRF)7 rather than that of IRF3 in the GCRV-infected cells, leading to the activation of type I IFN (IFN-I). Simultaneously, magnolol drastically facilitated the expression of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, but failed to induce the molecules in nuclear factor (NF)-omicron B pathways. Differently, honokiol strikingly motivated not only the expression of IL-1 beta, but also those of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and NF-kappa B. Interestingly, though honokiol motivated the expression of IFN-beta promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1), IRF3 and IRF7, it failed to up-regulate the expression of IFN-I, indicating that honokiol enhanced the host innate antiviral response to GCRV infection via NF-kappa B pathways. Collectively, the present study revealed that magnolol and honokiol facilitated the expression of innate immune-related genes to strengthen the innate immune signaling responses to resist GCRV infection, which contributed to understanding the mechanisms by which small-molecule drugs possessed antiviral activities. In addition, these results lay a foundation for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral compounds in aquaculture industry. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",130
"Research summary: We use a variance decomposition methodology to assess the degree to which board chairs may influence their companies' performance. To isolate the board chair effect, we focus on firms in which the CEO and board chair positions are separated. Using a U.S. sample of 6,290 firm-year observations representing 1,828 board chairs in 308 different industries, our results indicate that the board chair effect is substantial at about nine percent. Drawing on resource dependency theory, we also theorize and show how this board chair effect is contingent on the task environment in which firms operate. Our results add to the literature examining the role and influence of board chairs and the context in which chairs may have a greater impact on performance.Managerial summary: Following institutional and regulatory changes, more firms are separating the CEO and board chair positions. With an increasing number of individuals separate from the CEO serving as board chairs, a critical question becomes: What influence do these separate board chairs have on firm performance? Prior research suggests that separate board chairs can provide important resourcesincluding advice and counsel, legitimacy, information linkages, and preferential access to external commitments and supportto their CEOs, other top managers, and overall firms. In turn, who the board chair is and the individual's ability (or lack thereof) to provide these resources may have a significant impact on firm performance. Offering support for this perspective, we find that separate board chairs explain nine percent of the variance in firm performance. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",66
"The adoption of quality assurance methods based on software process improvement models has been regarded as an important source of variability in software productivity. Some companies perceive that their implementation has prohibitive costs, whereas some authors identify in their use a way to comply with software development patterns and standards, produce economic value and lead to corporate performance improvement. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between quality maturity levels and labor productivity, using a data set containing 687 Brazilian software firms. We study here the relationship between labor productivity, as measured through the annual gross revenue per worker ratio, and quality levels, which were appraised from 2006 to 2012 according to two distinct software process improvement models: MPS.BR and CMMI. We perform independent statistical tests using appraisals carried out according to each of these models, consequently obtaining a data set with as many observations as possible, in order to seek strong support for our research. We first show that MPS.BR and CMMI appraised quality maturity levels are correlated, but we find no statistical evidence that they are related to higher labor productivity or productivity growth. On the contrary, we present evidence suggesting that average labor productivity is higher in software companies without appraised quality levels. Moreover, our analyses suggest that companies with appraised quality maturity levels are more or less productive depending on factors such as their business nature, main origin of capital and maintained quality level.",123
"Jumping to conclusions (JTC) distinguishes patients with schizophrenia from both healthy and psychiatric controls. JTC is typically assessed using the beads task, which, however, faces a number of limitations as to its interpretability and reliability. The present study set out to validate a new paradigm to assess JTC: the box task. We adopted a psychometric psychosis proneness approach and divided a large population sample into participants who scored high versus low on a scale tapping psychosis-like experiences. Participants performed a variant of the original beads task along with a new JTC task, the box task, with or without time pressure. The box task requires participants to infer which of two ball colors will be more prevalent in a matrix of boxes. The box task and the beads task were significantly correlated at a medium effect size, thus demonstrating criterion validity for the box task. As hypothesized, participants who scored high on psychosis-like experiences showed particularly strong JTC and a decreased decision threshold relative to low scorers, especially in the box task version with time pressure; in contrast, group differences in the beads tasks only achieved trend-wise significance. Mediation analyses showed that fewer draws to decisions were predicted by either a lower decision threshold or by higher initial probability estimates for the dominant item. The study establishes the criterion and construct validity of a new JTC task. Its advantages over the traditional beads task are better comprehensibility and usability; multiple parallel versions can be created thus raising reliability.",72
"The mitochondrial toxicity of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) is due to the inhibition of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymerase gamma (Pol gamma), resulting in a blockade of mtDNA replication and subsequent disruption of cellular energetics. Because mtDNA Pol gamma is not only involved in mtDNA replication but also responsible for mtDNA repair, we hypothesize that mitochondrial oxidative stress leads to changes in the balance between mtDNA repair and mutation following stavudine (d4T) treatment. However, the mechanisms underlying how changes in mtDNA base excision repair (mtBER) lead to mtDNA mutation remain unclear. To test this hypothesis, total mitochondrial repair capability, different steps of mtBER, mtDNA mutations in D-loop, and oxidative stress were all assessed in cultured HuH-7 human hepatoblast cells treated with d4T for 2 weeks. Assessment by denaturing Southern blotting and quantitative PCR revealed that d4T significantly reduced in vivo repair of H(2)O(2) damaged mtDNA in HuH-7 cells. d4T reduced total in vitro mtBER and DNA Pol gamma capability, but did not affect mtDNA oxoguanine glycosylase and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease activity in HuH-7 cells. In addition, d4T treatment is associated with a significant increase in the frequency of mtDNA mutations in HuH-7 cells. In conclusion, d4T treatment reduces mtBER and contributes mechanistically to NRTI-induced mtDNA mutation. These events may potentially be associated with some diseases linked to mtDNA mutation.

"Psychological science that examines racial and gender bias, primarily located within social psychology, has tended to discount the ways in which race and gender mutually construct each other. Lay conceptions of racial and gender discrimination tend to see racism as primarily afflicting men and sexism primarily afflicting White women, when in fact race and gender are interrelated and work together intersectionally. Ignoring women's experiences of racial discrimination produces androcentric conceptions of racisms-in other words, many definitions of racial discrimination are to some degree sexist (Goff et al., 2008). Similarly, privileging the experiences of White women produces narrow definitions of gender discrimination-in other words, many definitions of gender discrimination are to some degree racist, such that they serve to reinforce the current societal hierarchies. Psychological science sometimes appears to reflect such conceptions. The result is that the social science principally responsible for explaining individual-level biases has developed a body of research that can undervalue the experiences of non-White women (Goff et al., 2008). This article examines features of social psychological science and its research processes to answer a question suggested by this framing: is the current psychological understanding of racism, to some extent, sexist and the understanding of sexism, to some extent, racist? We argue here that the instruments that much of social psychological science uses to measure racial and gender discrimination may play a role in producing inaccurate understandings of racial and gender discrimination. We also present original experimental data to suggest that lay conceptions parallel social psychology's biases: with lay persons also assuming that racism is about Black men and sexism is about White women. 2 Finally, we provide some suggestions to increase the inclusivity of psychology's study of discrimination as well as reasons for optimism in this area.",63
"The chemokine (C-X3-C motif) ligand 1 (CX3CL1), also named fractalkine (FKN), has been implicated in psychiatric disorders and functions as a novel adipocytokine. However, no attention has been paid to the role of FKN in anorexia nervosa (AN). The current study was performed to explore FKN levels in AN to determine its role in the involvement of AN. A total of 96 girls aged 11-18years with AN (n=34), healthy controls (HC; n=32) and simple obesity (OB, n=30) were enrolled in the cross-sectional study. Blood samples were collected during the fasting state. Serum FKN concentrations were determined using ELISA. The skinfold thickness (TSF) of the biceps and triceps as well as mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC) were used to determine the nutritional status. Our results showed that serum FKN levels were significantly lower in the AN group than in the control and OB groups. After adjusting for body mass index (BMI), FKN concentrations in the AN group were statistically higher than in the HC and OB groups. Significant correlations between serum FKN and body weight, BMI, Cole index and serum insulin were observed. In addition, serum FKN levels were positively related to TSF and MAMC in all subjects. Serum FKN concentrations are attenuated in girls with AN compared with healthy adolescents and are positively related to nutritional status. The lower FKN levels may be regulated by nutrition status and response to starvation. After adjusting for BMI, higher FKN levels may reflect that persistent inflammation is present in patients with AN.",67
"Religion has an essential effect on the development of any society since it impacts religious norms and models of behaviour, establishes priorities and values, influences gender relations, predetermines gender roles, and influences the establishing of certain traditions, laws, and customs. This article is a review of the historic position of the Russian Orthodox Church - the dominant religion in Russia - its past and current status in Russia, and the issues relating to women in Russian socio-cultural and religious community. While there is a lack of research on the Russian Orthodox Church and its influence on Russians and, particularly, Russian women, the increased religiosity in Russia within the last decade requires us to study the Russian Orthodoxy and its impact on people's lives and its attitude to gender. This article provides a deep analysis of the impact of the Russian Orthodox Church on the image of women in Russia. It has been argued that Russian national character and heritage was formed by the Russian Orthodox Church and the existing gender stereotypes in Russia have been significantly impacted by the Russian Orthodox Church and have mainly been derived from the interpretation of the New Testament by the Russian Orthodoxy and its clergy. Particularly, gender roles and the perception of family, and marriage are understood to be in compliance with the values of the Russian Orthodox faith. For the faith the most important purpose of marriage is the birth and raising of children and the chief responsibility and duty of a woman is to care for her husband and children as these are considered as a way of the woman's service to society and to God.",77
"Clustering is one of the basic tasks in data mining and machine learning which aims at discovering hidden structure in the data. For many real-world applications, there often exist many different yet meaningful clusterings while most of existing clustering methods only produce a single clustering. To address this limitation, multiple clustering, which tries to generate clusterings that are high quality and different from each other, has emerged recently. In this paper, we propose a novel alternative clustering method that generates non-redundant multiple clusterings sequentially. The algorithm is built upon nonnegative matrix factorization, and we take advantage of the nonnegative property to enforce the non-redundancy. Specifically, we design a quadratic term to measure the redundancy between the reference clustering and the new clustering, and incorporate it into the objective. The optimization problem takes on a very simple form, and can be solved efficiently by multiplicative updating rules. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is comparable to or outperforms existing multiple clustering methods.",1
"This paper provides an in-depth understanding of social dynamics in the form of kinship ties in matrilineal societies. It unpacks gender roles and relationships at the community level to understand how social structures, created by the pattern of relations, enhance or hinder coping initiatives during lake recessions in the Lake Chilwa socio-ecological system. Using qualitative and quantitative methods including in-depth interviews, Focus Group Discussions (FGD) and household questionnaires, this paper provides insights into how people in the Lake Chilwa social-ecological system prepare for and cope with Lake Chilwa water recessions by capitalising on their social networks. The findings have shown that during lake recessions poor households in the Lake Chilwa socio-ecological system are cushioned by fellow households through lineage networks. There is strong tradition secured through kinship ties where the generic term 'mwambo wathu' (our tradition) embraces a group of formative norms enforced via a series of rules and rituals. Based in a matrilineal system, women have strong rights over land allocation and use in which the female sorority group 'mbumba' is very stable. There is a great deal of reciprocity and food redistribution among the households. This self-organization provides deeper meaning about how people assimilate the dynamics affecting their social and natural environments. Specifically the findings provide evidence on how households, communities and their livelihoods in Africa are reconstructed as natural resources fluctuate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"Social stress modifies the activity of brain areas involved in the rewarding effects of psychostimulants, inducing neuroadaptations in the dopaminergic mesolimbic system and modifying the sensitivity of dopamine receptors. In the present study we evaluated the effect of the dopamine D-1-and D-2 -like receptor antagonists (SCH23390 and raclopride, respectively) on the short-time effects of acute social defeat (ASD). Male OF1 mice were"" socially defeated before each conditioning session of the conditioned place preference (CPP) induced by 1 mg/kg or 25 mg/kg of cocaine plus the corresponding dopamine antagonist. A final experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of the dopamine antagonists on the CPP induced by 3 mg/kg of cocaine with or without a stress experience. Mice exposed to ASD showed an increase in reinstatement of the conditioned reinforcing effects of cocaine that was blocked by all of the dopamine receptor antagonists. Blockade of dopamine D2-like receptors with raclopride specifically prevented the effects of stress without affecting the rewarding properties of cocaine. However, SCH23390 inhibited cocaine-induced preference in the control groups and even induced aversion in defeated mice conditioned with the lower dose of cocaine. Moreover, the lowest dose of SCH23390 blocked the rewarding effects of 3 mg/kg of cocaine-induced CPP. Our results confirm that the dopamine D2 receptor is involved in the short-term effects of ASD on the rewarding effects of cocaine. The dopamine D1 receptor is clearly involved in the rewarding effects of cocaine, but its role in the effects of ASD remains to be demonstrated.",104
"Biliary adenofibroma is a rare primary hepatic neoplasm, recognized in the World Health Organization classification, although only 14 cases have been reported to date. This series includes extended follow-up from 2 of the early case reports and 4 novel cases. Clinical history and histology were reviewed in all 6 cases. Tumor DNA was analyzed for point mutations by multiplex polymerase chain reaction and copy number alterations by array comparative genomic hybridization. The patients included 4 females and 2 males presenting between 46 and 83 years of age, with tumors ranging from 7 to 16 cm in diameter. The tumors had similar morphology, with tubules and cysts lined mainly by bland to mildly atypical cuboidal epithelium embedded in fibrous stroma. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction did not identify mutations in 4 tumors tested. Three tumors tested by array comparative genomic hybridization showed chromosomal copy number alterations, including 1 with amplifications of CCND1 and ERBB2. Three patients underwent resection with no recurrence at 21, 20, and 3 years of follow-up. One patient is alive after 14 months with no resection. Two patients with margin-positive resections had local recurrence at 1 and 6 years after surgery. No patient had distant metastasis. The distinct morphology and multiple clonal cytogenetic alterations in biliary adenofibromas indicate that the lesions are neoplastic. Amplifications of CCND1 and ERBB2 are not typical of benign neoplasms, and suggest that these tumors may have the ability to behave aggressively. However, the clinical outcomes in these patients suggest the neoplasms are only slowly progressive.",34
"The aim of this study was to investigate consultant genitourinary (GU) physicians' and health advisers' views regarding acceptability of patient-delivered partner therapy (PDPT) in the United Kingdom (UK). A postal questionnaire was sent to all consultant GU physicians and senior health advisers: 206 (65%) physician questionnaires and 153 (77%) health-adviser questionnaires were returned. One hundred and three (50%) physicians and 31 (22%) health advisers reported ever having used PDPT. Approximately one-third of professionals are strongly opposed to PDPT. However, the majority of both professional groups are cautiously prepared to consider PDPT, but only if there is no other option and only if a health professional first makes contact with the partner. Chief concern among health professionals is the legal status of PDPT in the UK. Here, the current General Medical Council (GMC) guidance on remote prescribing is helpful. The outcome of the Medical Research Council randomized controlled trial on accelerated partner therapy, which fits in with GMC guidance, is eagerly awaited as professionals would welcome evidence-based national guidance.",25
"Background: Rotator cuff muscle degeneration is an important parameter to consider when planning shoulder arthroplasty. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that rotator cuff muscle degeneration is correlated with scapulohumeral subluxation in patients planned for anatomical total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA). Materials and methods: We developed a semi-automated quantitative CT method to measure rotator cuff muscle degeneration, and retrospectively analyzed 107 preoperative shoulder CT scans of patients with primary osteoarthritis. On a standardized sagittal-oblique CT slice perpendicular to the scapular axis, two observers measured the cross-sectional areas of residual rotator cuff muscle tissues, normalized by the estimated area of healthy muscles. Muscle degeneration was quantified in a semi-automated manner, and divided into atrophy and fatty infiltration. Scapulohumeral subluxation was determined in 3D as the distance between the humeral head center and the glenoid surface center, projected on the same CT slice, and normalized by the humeral head radius. We tested all potential correlations between muscle degeneration and scapulohumeral subluxation. Results: Muscle degeneration, primarily due to atrophy, predominated in the supraspinatus; it varied from 0.8% to 88.8%. Scapulohumeral subluxation varied from 2.5% to 72.9%, and was mainly in a posterior and postero-superior orientation. There was a significant but weak correlation between the amount of subluxation and both supraspinatus (R = 0.207, A=0.032) and infraspinatus (R = 0.225, A=0.020) degeneration. Inter- and intra-observer reproducibility of muscle degeneration measurements were both excellent (ICCs range = 0.955-0.987 and 0.971-0.988, respectively). Conclusion: This new semi-automated CT method allows to quantitatively and reproducibly measure rotator cuff muscle degeneration in shoulders with primary osteoarthritis. Muscle degeneration is weakly correlated with scapulohumeral subluxation in patients planned for anatomical TSA. Level of evidence: Level IV. Type of study: Diagnostic retrospective study.

"Depression is a highly prevalent mental health problem and is a co-morbidity of other mental, physical, and behavioural disorders. The internet allows individuals who are depressed or caring for those who are depressed, to connect with others via online communities; however, the characteristics of these discussions have not yet been fully explored. This work aims to explore the textual cues of online communities interested in depression. A total of 5,000 posts were randomly selected from 24 online communities. Five subgroups of online communities were identified: Depression, Bipolar Disorder, Self-Harm, Grief/Bereavement, and Suicide. Psycholinguistic features and content topics were extracted from the posts and analysed. Machine learning techniques were used to discriminate the online conversations in the depression communities from the other subgroups. Topics and psycholinguistic features were found to be highly valid predictors of community subgroup. Clear discrimination between linguistic features and topics, alongside good predictive power is an important step in understanding social media and its use in mental health.",115
"Context: Bladder management in spina bifida patients relies on clean intermittent catheterization and oral antimuscarinics with a significant failure rate. The efficacy of intradetrusor injections of botulinum toxin has been confirmed in patients with spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis but not in patients with myelomeningocele.Objective: To conduct a systematic review of current evidence regarding the efficacy of intra-detrusor injections of Botulinum Toxin A (BTX-A) in spina bifida patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) refractory to antimuscarinics.Methods: A research has been conducted on Medline and Embase using the keywords: (spina bifida OR myelomeningocele OR dysraphism) AND toxin. The search strategy and studies selection were performed using the PICOS method according to the PRISMA statement.Result: Twelve published series were included (n=293 patients). All patients were <18 years old. There was no randomized study comparing BTX-A versus placebo and most studies had no control group. Most studies reported a clinical and urodynamic improvement with resolution of incontinence in 32-100% of patients, a decrease in maximum detrusor pressure from 32 to 54%, an increase of maximum cystometric capacity from 27 to 162%, and an improvement in bladder compliance of 28-176%. Two studies suggested lower efficacy in patients with low compliance bladder compared to those with isolated detrusor overactivity.Conclusion: Intradetrusor injections of BTX-A could be effective in children with spina bifida but this assumption is not supported by high level of evidence studies. There is no data available in adult patients. Neurourol. Urodynam. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",17
"Understanding basic concepts of electronics and computer programming allows researchers to get the most out of the equipment found in their laboratories. Although a number of platforms have been specifically designed for the general public and are supported by a vast array of on-line tutorials, this subject is not normally included in university chemistry curricula. Aiming to provide the basic concepts of hardware and software, this article is focused on the design and use of a simple module to control a series of PDMS-based valves. The module is based on a low-cost microprocessor (Teensy) and open-source software (Arduino). The microvalves were fabricated using thin sheets of PDMS and patterned using CO2 laser engraving, providing a simple and efficient way to fabricate devices without the traditional photolithographic process or facilities. Synchronization of valve control enabled the development of two simple devices to perform injection (1.6 +/- 0.4 mu L/stroke) and mixing of different solutions. Furthermore, a practical demonstration of the utility of this system for microscale chemical sample handling and analysis was achieved performing an on-chip acid-base titration, followed by conductivity detection with an open-source low-cost detection system. Overall, the system provided a very reproducible (98%) platform to perform fluid delivery at the microfluidic scale.",40
"This study explored the role of fibulin-4 in osteosarcoma progression and the possible signaling pathway involved. Fibulin-4 mRNA and protein expression in normal tissue, benign fibrous dysplasia, osteosarcoma, osteosarcoma cell lines, the normal osteoblastic cell line hFOB, and different invasive subclones were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or immunocytochemistry (ICC) and real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (real-time qRT-PCR). Using in vitro functional assays, we analyzed the invasive and proliferative abilities of different osteosarcoma cell lines and subclones with differing invasive potential. To assess the role of fibulin-4 in the invasion and metastasis of osteosarcoma cells, lentiviral vectors with fibulin-4 small hairpin RNA (shRNA) and pLVX-fibulin-4 were constructed and used to infect the highly invasive and low invasive subclones and osteosarcoma cell lines. The effects of fibulin-4 knockdown and upregulation on the biological behavior of osteosarcoma cells were investigated by functional in vitro and in vivo assays. The results revealed that fibulin-4 expression was upregulated in osteosarcoma, and was positively correlated with low differentiation, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis. Fibulin-4 was also found to be over-expressed in highly invasive cell lines and in the highly invasive subclones. Fibulin-4 could promote osteosarcoma cell invasion and metastasis by inducing EMT via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that fibulin-4 is a promoter of osteosarcoma development and progression, and suggest a novel therapeutic target for future studies.",37
"Pervious paving (PPS) model rigs have been used in laboratory-based experiments to determine the impact of a glyphosate-containing herbicide (GCH) on the ability of the PPS to retain and biodegrade pollutants. Using three concentrations of GCH (7200, 720, and 72mgL(-1)) and used engine oil, it was found that hydrocarbon in the effluent increased with time, and with increasing GCH concentration. Turbidity increased and pH decreased with time, with the highest application of GCH declining by a whole pH unit to become slightly acidic. For Zn, Cu, and Pb, values for the lowest concentration of GCH, whilst slightly higher than the control mirrored its temporal trend and the highest concentration of GCH decreased with time. For the medium GCH concentration, however, Zn and Pb increased toward the end of the monitoring period. Dissolution experiments appeared to confirm speculation that the surfactant in the GCH may be forming an emulsion with the oil facilitating the release of metals associated with the oil. Particulate-associated pollutants possibly released from the aggregate may be desorbed as the pH declined in the PPS rig. This raises concerns for receiving water quality, particularly with UK legislation encouraging the use of sustainable drainage systems and therefore PPS.",93
"A novel variational Bayesian mixture of experts model for robust regression of bifurcating and piece-wise continuous processes is introduced. The mixture of experts model is a powerful model which probabilistically splits the input space allowing different models to operate in the separate regions. However, current methods have no fail-safe against outliers. In this paper, a robust mixture of experts model is proposed which consists of Student-t mixture models at the gates and Student-t distributed experts, trained via Bayesian inference. The Student-t distribution has heavier tails than the Gaussian distribution, and so it is more robust to outliers, noise and non normality in the data. Using both simulated data and real data obtained from the Z24 bridge this robust mixture of experts performs better than its Gaussian counterpart when outliers are present. In particular, it provides robustness to outliers in two forms: unbiased parameter regression models, and robustness to overfitting/complex models.",49
"Spreading depolarizations occur spontaneously and frequently in injured human brain. They propagate slowly through injured tissue often cycling around a local area of damage. Tissue recovery after an spreading depolarization requires greatly augmented energy utilisation to normalise ionic gradients from a virtually complete loss of membrane potential. In the injured brain, this is difficult because local blood flow is often low and unreactive. In this study, we use a new variant of microdialysis, continuous on-line microdialysis, to observe the effects of spreading depolarizations on brain metabolism. The neurochemical changes are dynamic and take place on the timescale of the passage of an spreading depolarization past the microdialysis probe. Dialysate potassium levels provide an ionic correlate of cellular depolarization and show a clear transient increase. Dialysate glucose levels reflect a balance between local tissue glucose supply and utilisation. These show a clear transient decrease of variable magnitude and duration. Dialysate lactate levels indicate non-oxidative metabolism of glucose and show a transient increase. Preliminary data suggest that the transient changes recover more slowly after the passage of a sequence of multiple spreading depolarizations giving rise to a decrease in basal dialysate glucose and an increase in basal dialysate potassium and lactate levels.",69
"Trees, and their derivative products, have been used by societies around the world for thousands of years. Contemporary construction of tall buildings from timber, in whole or in part, suggests a growing interest in the potential for building with wood at a scale not previously attainable. As wood is the only significant building material that is grown, we have a natural inclination that building in wood is good for the environment. But under what conditions is this really the case? The environmental benefits of using timber are not straightforward; although it is a natural product, a large amount of energy is used to dry and process it. Much of this can come from the biomass of the tree itself, but that requires investment in plant, which is not always possible in an industry that is widely distributed among many small producers. And what should we build with wood? Are skyscrapers in timber a good use of this natural resource, or are there other aspects of civil and structural engineering, or large-scale infrastructure, that would be a better use of wood? Here, we consider a holistic picture ranging in scale from the science of the cell wall to the engineering and global policies that could maximise forestry and timber construction as a boon to both people and the planet.",31
"This paper focuses on the analysis of the electrical network loadability through the power flow model extended to consider the Secondary Voltage Control. Unlike the conventional power flow, the number of power flow variables is increased, keeping constant the number of equations. The application of Newton's method to solve this set of nonlinear equations requires the solution of an under-determined linear system at each iteration. This brings flexibility to obtain operational solutions taking into account performance indexes related to either the iterative process or the power system operation. This so-called extended power flow method has been computationally implemented and tests have been performed considering different loadability and initial solutions. The IEEE 118-bus test system is used to illustrate the application of the proposed methodology.",50
"First introduced to Egypt in 2006, H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza has resulted in the death of millions of birds and caused over 350 infections and at least 117 deaths in humans. After a decade of viral circulation, outbreaks continue to occur and diffusion mechanisms between poultry farms remain unclear. Using landscape genetics techniques, we identify the distance models most strongly correlated with the genetic relatedness of the viruses, suggesting the most likely methods of viral diffusion within Egyptian poultry. Using 73 viral genetic sequences obtained from infected birds throughout northern Egypt between 2009 and 2015, we calculated the genetic dissimilarity between H5N1 viruses for all eight gene segments. Spatial correlation was evaluated using Mantel tests and correlograms and multiple regression of distance matrices within causal modeling and relative support frameworks. These tests examine spatial patterns of genetic relatedness, and compare different models of distance. Four models were evaluated: Euclidean distance, road network distance, road network distance via intervening markets, and a least-cost path model designed to approximate wild waterbird travel using niche modeling and circuit theory. Samples from backyard farms were most strongly correlated with least cost path distances. Samples from commercial farms were most strongly correlated with road network distances. Results were largely consistent across gene segments. Results suggest wild birds play an important role in viral diffusion between backyard farms, while commercial farms experience human-mediated diffusion. These results can inform avian influenza surveillance and intervention strategies in Egypt. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights",34
"Owing to the limitation of fossil fuels and high consumption and pollution for transportation, the vehicle industry is looking for other sources of energy. A fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle (FCHEV) could be a suitable solution considering the state of the art of main components. This paper presents the simulation of powertrains for FCHEVs in order to dimension the fuel cell (FC) as primary source of energy and to investigate the power flows during both motoring and recuperative braking. For this purpose a Matlab/Simulink (R) model has been built up which can be used for a wide range of applications. The results of simulation show which is the best powertrain configuration for two-wheeled vehicles in three different cases: a bike in which the traction force is provided by both electric motor and the pedaling of the cyclist, a bike in which the traction force is provided only by an electric motor without pedaling and a motorcycle for 2 passengers. Specifically, the consumption, the state of charge (SOC) of battery and the amount of energy generated by each source of energy have been monitored. The model validation was done by comparison between the obtained results and scientific articles in the literature.",53
"A company produces prefabricated stirrup cages for the reinforcement of concrete. The process consists of straightening, cutting and twin bending of coiled steel re-bars, in a custom produced machine. The punch of the cutting system failed repeatedly. Its cutting edges lose their functionality much earlier than expected. Two representative pieces were analyzed. The study included visual inspection, chemical analysis, hardness and micro-hardness measurements. Optical metallographic examination on representative samples was carried out. The fracture areas were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the crack initiation and propagation were discussed. The punches failed by chipping wear mechanism due to low-cycle fatigue. Their repeating failures provoked by faulty machine design. Problem solving suggestions are proposed. In addition, alternatives related to material selection are provided in order to reduce crack susceptibility, in an economical way. Moreover, conclusions and recommendations can be useful, resulting in higher productivity of prefabricated stirrup cages. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",85
"Psoriasis has been intensively studied recently and numerous risk-associated variants within 44 susceptibility loci have been discovered. Estimates suggest that the genetic contribution to PsA (psoriatic arthritis) may be higher than PsV (psoriasis vulgaris) yet most work has been done on the latter due to its greater population prevalence. To test whether variants in the PsV-associated loci are also related to PsA, we performed a candidate loci association study in Chinese population. Genotyping was performed by MassARRAY platform (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA). 50 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with reported evidences for association with psoriasis were genotyped in 465 PsA cases and 421 healthy controls collected from Chinese population. Data handling, quality control and association analysis were performed using PLINK software (v. 1.07). SNPs in 5q33.3, 1p36 and 1q21.3 showed convincing evidence of association (rs7709212, P = 4.82 x 10(-5), rs7536201, P = 3.89 x 10(-4), rs1886734 P = 6.81 x 10(-4), respectively). IL12B, RUNX3 and LCE were candidate genes in these regions. The combination of SNPs rs1886734 and rs7709212 was the best predictive model for PsA as compared to the control in test for gene-gene interaction. In conclusion, we assessed 36 non-HLA psoriasis susceptibility loci in PsA cohort, confirmed the association of three loci with PsA, these findings may help in developing possible genetic markers to predict PsA.",22
"Planar shape interpolation is a classic problem in computer graphics. We present a novel shape interpolation method that blends C-infinity planar harmonic mappings represented in closed-form. The intermediate mappings in the blending are guaranteed to be locally injective C-infinity harmonic mappings, with conformal and isometric distortion bounded by that of the input mappings. The key to the success of our method is the fact that the blended differentials of our interpolated mapping have a simple closed-form expression, so they can be evaluated with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy. Moreover, in contrast to previous approaches, these differentials are integrable, and result in an actual mapping without further modification. Our algorithm is embarrassingly parallel and is orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art methods due to its simplicity, yet it still produces mappings that are superior to those of existing techniques due to its guaranteed bounds on geometric distortion.",79

"Worrying is a key concept in describing the complex relationship between anxiety and cognitive control. On the one hand, cognitive control processes might underlie the specific tendency to engage in worrying (i.e., trait worry), conceptualized as a future-oriented mental problem-solving activity. On the other hand, the general tendency to experience the signs and symptoms of anxiety (i.e., trait anxiety) is suggested to impair cognitive control because worrisome thoughts interfere with task-relevant processing. Based on these opposing tendencies, we predicted that the effect of the two related constructs, trait anxiety and trait worry, might cancel out one another. In statistics, such instances have been termed suppressor situations. In four experiments, we found evidence for such a suppressor situation: When their shared variance was controlled, trait worry was positively whereas trait anxiety was negatively related to performance in a memory task requiring strategic, effortful retrieval. We also showed that these opposing effects are related to temporal context reinstatement. Our results suggest that trait worry and trait anxiety possess unique sources of variance, which differently relate to performance in memory tasks requiring cognitive control.",81
"Purpose The aim of this study was to investigate the risk of falls and fractures among older adults receiving atypical antipsychotics. Methods An emulation analysis of a previously published study was performed using the US Truven MarketScan Medicare Supplemental database (MDCR). In addition, modified analyses were implemented to evaluate alternative confounding control strategies that (1) included all covariates used to fit propensity score models in outcome models and (2) required patients to have a mental health condition diagnosis and a health care visit within 90 days prior to the index date. Findings The MDCR emulation analyses yielded similar results as the previous study. For the previous study and our emulation analysis, the results were: nonvertebral osteoporotic fractures (odds ratio [OR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.41-1.60; and OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.37-1.63, respectively), hip fractures (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.53-1.81; and OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.43-1.77, respectively), any fracture (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.24-1.34; and OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.23-1.41, respectively), and falls (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.47-1.61; and OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.11-1.89, respectively). However, in modified analyses, no associations were significant. The primary change that resulted in the attenuation of associations was the requirement for patients to have a mental health condition diagnosis and a health care visit prior to the index date. Conclusions Our MDCR emulation analysis yielded similar results as a previous study; however, in modified analyses, the associations between fractures and falls and atypical antipsychotics were no longer significant. The contrast of results between the emulation and modified analyses may be due to the analytic approach used to compare patients (and potential confounding by indication). Further research is warranted to evaluate these associations.",72
"Background: While opiate substitution therapy and injecting equipment provision (IEP) have reduced blood-borne viruses (BBV) among people who inject drugs (PWID), some PWID continue to share injecting equipment and acquire BBV. Psychosocial interventions that address risk behaviours could reduce BBV transmission among PWID. Methods: A pragmatic, two-armed randomised controlled, open feasibility study of PWID attending drug treatment or IEP in four UK regions. Ninety-nine PWID were randomly allocated to receive a three-session manualised psychosocial group intervention and BBV transmission information booklet plus treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 52) or information booklet plus TAU (n = 47). The intervention was developed from evidence-based literature, qualitative interviews with PWID, key stakeholder consultations, and expert opinion. Recruitment rates, retention in treatment, followup completion rates and health economic data completion measured feasibility. Results: Fifty-six percent (99/176) of eligible PWID were recruited. More participants attended at least one intervention session in London (10/16; 63%) and North Wales (7/13; 54%) than in Glasgow (3/12; 25%) and York (0/11). Participants who attended no sessions (n = 32) compared to those attending at least one (n = 20) session were more likely to be homeless (56 vs 25%, p = 0.044), injected drugs for a greater number of days (median 25 vs 6.5, p = 0.019) and used a greater number of needles from an IEP in the last month (median 31 vs 20, p = 0.056). No adverse events were reported. 45.5% (45/99) were followed up 1 month post-intervention. Feedback forms confirmed that the intervention was acceptable to both intervention facilitators and participants who attended it. Follow-up attendance was associated with fewer days of injecting in the last month (median 14 vs 27, p = 0.030) and fewer injections of cocaine (13 vs 30%, p = 0.063). Analysis of the questionnaires identified several service use questionnaire categories that could be excluded from the assessment battery in a full-randomised controlled trial. Conclusions: Findings should be interpreted with caution due to small sample sizes. A future definitive RCT of the psychosocial intervention is not feasible. The complex needs of some PWID may have limited their engagement in the intervention. More flexible delivery methods may have greater reach.",130
"Recent developments in understanding the role of bile acids (BAs) as signalling molecules in human metabolism and inflammation have opened new avenues in the field of hepatology research. BAs are no longer considered as simple molecules helping in fat digestion but as agents with real therapeutic value in treating complex autoimmune and metabolic liver diseases. BAs and their receptors such as farnesoid X receptor, transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor 5 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor have been identified as novel targets for drug development. Some of these novel pharmaceuticals are already in clinical evaluation with the most advanced drugs having reached phase III trials. Chronic liver diseases such as primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, for which there is no or limited pharmacotherapy, are most likely to gain from these developments. In this review we discuss recent and the most relevant basic and clinical research findings related to BAs and their implications for novel therapy for chronic liver diseases.",32
"The present article reviews the biotechnological research in Zingiber montanum (Koenig) Link ex A. Dietr. (cassumunar ginger). Studies on biotechnological interventions in this plant were focused mainly on the application of tissue culture techniques. Recently, attentions are being drawn towards the genomic studies which mostly aimed at establishing the genetic relationship of different gene pools. The present review summarizes the various aspects of tissue culture protocol for in vitro micropropagation, in vitro microrhizome induction, in vitro conservation technology and molecular biology studies of this medicinal plant. This review will help in further research of this plant in areas related to tissue culture for propagation and increased production of important secondary metabolites, phylogenetic analysis and genetic engineering. Moreover, it will offer an insight into crop improvement and breeding programs of this important underutilized medicinal plant for improved yield and quality of secondary metabolites.",30
"High work stress has been consistently associated with disturbed autonomic balance, specifically, lowered vagal cardiac control and increased sympathetic activity, which may lead to increased cardiovascular risk. Stress management procedures have been proposed to reduce autonomic dysfunctions related to work stress in different categories of workers exposed to heightened work demands, while a limited number of studies addressed this issue in managers. The present study was aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) biofeedback (BF) intervention on psychological and physiological outcomes, in managers with high-level work responsibilities. Thirty-one managers leading outstanding private or public companies were randomly assigned to either a RSA-BF training (RSA-BF; N = 16) or a control group (N = 15). The RSA-BF training consisted of five weekly 45 min sessions, designed to increase RSA, whereas controls had to provide a daily stress diary once a week. After the training, managers in both groups reported reduced heart rate at rest, lower anxiety levels and improvement in health-related quality of life. More importantly, managers in the RSA-BF group showed increased vagal control (as indexed by increased RSA), decreased sympathetic arousal (as indexed by reduced skin conductance and systolic blood pressure) and lower emotional interferences, compared to managers in the control group. Results from this study showed that RSA-BF training was effective in improving cardiac autonomic balance at rest. Moreover, findings from this study underline the effectiveness of biofeedback in reducing psychophysiological negative outcomes associated with stress in managers.",29
"Programming for beginners is becoming increasingly more difficult to understand since most innovative tools immediately throw students into an environment where they must build everything in a program from nothing with inconsequential programming skills and little knowledge of programming concepts. As programming based careers are rising in demand, it is important to help the beginner programmers bridge the gap between understanding a program and developing one. Robot Chronicle offers a solution to this dilemma through a different approach than common state machines such as Scratch, Alice, Playmaker, and Code Spells and introduces the basic concepts of programming through a puzzle-based video game.",40
"To examine six chronic diseases and all-cause mortality among immigrants to Israel from areas contaminated by the Chernobyl accident. The medical data were obtained from the two largest HMOs in Israel. In the assessment of chronic diseases, individuals were divided into three groups: less exposed (n = 480), more exposed (n = 359), and liquidators (n = 45) and in the mortality analysis, into two groups: less exposed (n = 792) and more exposed (n = 590). Compared to the less exposed, adults from the more exposed group had increased odds of respiratory disorders (OR = 2.34, 95% CI 1.21, 4.54) and elevated odds, with borderline significance, of ischemic heart disease (OR = 2.01, 95% CI 0.97, 4.20). In addition, the liquidators had increased odds of hypertension compared to the less exposed (OR = 2.64, 95% CI 1.24, 5.64). The Cox proportional-hazards model indicated no difference in the ratio of all-cause mortality between the exposed groups during the follow up period. Our study, conducted approximately two decades after the accident, suggests that exposure to radionuclides may be associated with increased odds of respiratory disorders and hypertension.",129
"Loosely coupled applications composed of a potentially very large number (from tens of thousands to even billions) of tasks are commonly used in high-throughput computing and many-task computing paradigms. To efficiently execute large-scale computations which can exceed the capability in a single type of computing resources within expected time, we should be able to effectively integrate resources from heterogeneous distributed computing (HDC) systems such as clusters, grids, and clouds. In this paper, we quantitatively analyze the performance of three different real scientific applications consisting of many tasks on top of HDC systems based on a partnership of distributed computing clusters, grids, and clouds to understand the application and resource characteristics, and show practical issues that normal scientific users can face during the course of leveraging these systems. Our experimental study shows that the performance of a loosely coupled application can be significantly affected by the characteristics of a HDC system, along with hardware specification of a node, and their impacts on the performance can vary widely depending on the resource usage pattern of each application. We then devise a preference-based scheduling algorithm that can reflect characteristics and resource usage patterns of various loosely coupled applications running on top of HDC systems from our experimental study. Our preference-based scheduling algorithm can allocate the resources from different HDC systems to loosely coupled applications based on the preferences of the applications for the HDC systems. We evaluate the overall system performance over various preference types, using trace-based simulations, which can be determined based on different factors such as CPU specifications and application throughputs. Our simulation results demonstrate the importance of understanding the application and resource characteristics on effective scheduling of loosely coupled applications on the HDC systems.",2
Detection of DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) traffic is of great importance for the availability protection of services and other information and communication resources.

Simulation results of developed model showed accuracy of 95.6% in classification of pre-defined classes of traffic.,46
"In this paper a low power and low output ripple regulator is designed with teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) for radio frequency identification applications. In order to decrease the power consumption the voltage of regulator sub-blocks is supplied from elementary stages. In the proposed operational amplifier employed to the regulator, adaptive biasing is used and bandgap reference of the regulator is totally designed by MOSFET. To optimize the proposed regulator after modeling the regulator with the help of neural network, TLBO algorithm is used. The outputs of TLBO are output voltage, ripple value and power consumption. By using this algorithm the output voltage is 0.8 V with 2.78 mV ripple and power consumption. Also the quiescent current of this design is decreased to 290 nA. The chip area of the layout design in Cadence software is about . The operation frequency of this circuit is 960 MHz and the simulation is done in CMOS technology.",60
"The purpose of this study is to evaluate if locus of control (LOC) predicts various quality of life (QOL) and mental well-being measures among terminally ill cancer patients at the time of palliative care consult. Multi-site analysis of patients with advanced cancer being seen as new patients in a Palliative and Supportive Care outpatient clinic. Patients completed the following surveys: locus of control (LOC) scale, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-General (FACT-G), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual (FACIT-Sp), Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), and Herth Hope Index (HHI). Regression models were created to examine the effect of LOC upon QOL, symptoms, and other measures of mental well-being. These models adjusted for the effect of age, gender, race, partnership status, education, and months since diagnosis as potential confounders. This study enrolled 100 patients. After adjusting for site, race, and partnership status, higher levels of LOC chance predicted decreased QOL (FACT-G) (p < 0.01). Higher levels of LOC chance also correlated with increased depression and anxiety (p < 0.01) and decreased meaning/peace and faith (p < 0.01). Additionally, higher levels of LOC chance predicted decreased hope (HHI) (p < 0.001). Terminally ill cancer patients with a high LOC chance may be at risk for decreased physical and mental well-being at the end of life. Efforts should be made to identify these patients and design interventions to increase their feeling of control over the situation in order to improve physical and mental well-being at the end of life.",69
"Objectives: To estimate the rates of hospitalizations in patients within 12 months after the first rituximab administration. Methods: Patients who received rituximab between 2001 and 2008 for either benign or malignant conditions were identified from Texas Medicare files. The hospitalization rates for these patients with any diagnoses that might represent toxicity were then compared in the 12 months before and after the first infusion of rituximab. Dose-response analyses were performed on the basis of the number of doses received in the 8 weeks after initiating rituximab and also using the cumulative number of doses as a time-dependent covariate. Results: In all, 2623 patients received rituximab as a single agent for malignant indications and 1124 received it for benign indications. Overall inpatient admission rates did not differ significantly between the 12 months before and after rituximab initiation in patients with benign or malignant conditions. Those with malignant conditions had higher rates of hospitalizations for cardiovascular, infectious, pulmonary, and neurological diagnoses after rituximab initiation. In those with nonmalignant conditions, the only increase was in hospitalizations for infections. Neither group of patients showed any clear dose-response relationships with any toxicity. Conclusions: The increased hospitalizations for potential toxicities seen in patients with malignant disease were presumably because of the underlying disease process and not rituximab. Rituximab does not appear to be associated with hospitalizations for serious toxicity within 12 months after the first infusion, with the possible exception of infection.",8
"Robots are capable of navigating and performing tasks in a wide range of environments. Yet, there is no systematic research on the relationship between robot and environments. In this paper, the intention is to place in context the importance of co-consideration of environments and robots for creating an intelligent living environment. As such, we develop a framework linking both robots and environments. The framework consists of (1) the robot-inclusiveness which measures how inclusive the environment for the robot is, (2) a taxonomy which classifies robot-environment interaction into five categories, (3) five design criteria and guidelines which support the design and evaluation of autonomous robotic systems in indoor and outdoor environments.

"Background: Eotaxin/CCL11 plays an important role in asthma. It acts through the chemokine receptor CCR3 expressed on hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells in the lung. Objective: To determine whether eotaxin/CCL11 modulates lung and bronchial fibroblast properties and thereby might contribute to airway remodeling. Methods: CCR3 expression was characterized on a lung fibroblast line (MRC-5; flow cytometry, fluorescent microscopy, RT-PCR, and Northern blotting), on primary bronchial fibroblasts (flow cytometry), and on fibroblasts in human lung tissue (confocal laser microscopy). The effects of eotaxin/CCL11 on lung fibroblast migration (Boyden chamber), proliferation (tritiated thymidine incorporation), a-smooth muscle actin expression (ELISA), 3-dimensional collagen gel contraction (floating gel), pro-alpha 1(I) collagen mRNA (Northern blotting), total collagen synthesis (tritiated proline incorporation), matrix metalloproteinase activity (gelatin zymography), and TGF-beta(1) release (ELISA) were evaluated. The contribution of eotaxin/CCL11/CCR3 binding on lung fibroblasts was also investigated by neutralizing experiments. Results: CCR3 is constitutively expressed in cultured lung and primary bronchial fibroblasts and colocalizes with specific surface markers for human fibroblasts in lung tissue. Eotaxin/CCL11 selectively modulates fibroblast activities by increasing their proliferation, matrix metalloproteinase 2 activity, and collagen synthesis but not their differentiation into myofibroblasts, contractility in collagen gel, or TGF-beta(1) release. Eotaxin/CCL11 enhances migration of lung fibroblasts in response to nonspecific chemoattractants, and this effect is completely inhibited by anti-CCR3-neutralizing antibodies. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that eotaxin/CCL11 has a direct and selective profibrogenic effect on lung and bronchial fibroblasts, providing a novel mechanism whereby eotaxin/CCL11 can participate in airway remodeling in asthma.",38
"Despite similar emotional deficiencies, primary psychopathic individuals can be situated on a continuum that spans from controlled to disinhibited. The constructs on which primary psychopaths are found to diverge, such as self-control, cognitive flexibility, and executive functioning, are crucially regulated by dopamine (DA). As such, the goal of this review is to examine which specific alterations in the mesa-cortico-limbic DA system and corresponding genes (e.g., TH, DAT, COMT, DRD2, DRD4) might bias development towards a more controlled or disinhibited expression of primary psychopathy. Based on empirical data, it is argued that primary psychopathy is generally related to a higher tonic and population activity of striatal DA neurons and lower levels of D2-type DA receptors in meso-cortico-limbic projections, which may boost motivational drive towards incentive-laden goals, dampen punishment sensitivity, and increase future reward-expectancy. However, increasingly higher levels of DA activity in the striatum (moderate versus pathological elevations), lower levels of DA functionality in the prefrontal cortex, and higher D1-to-D2-type receptor ratios in meso-cortico-limbic projections may lead to increasingly disinhibited and impetuous phenotypes of primary psychopathy. Finally, in order to provide a more coherent view on etiological mechanisms, we discuss interactions between DA and serotonin that are relevant for primary psychopathy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

When lepidopteran larvae are infected by a large quantity of pathogens or parasitized by nonadaptive parasitoids hemocytes in the hemocoel will encapsulate these foreign invaders Cellular encapsulation requires hemocytes particularly plasmatocytes to change their states from nonadhesive spherical cells into adhesive spreading cells However It is unclear how the changes of plasmatocytes are regulated Here we report that the integrin beta 1 subunit from hemocytes of Ostrinia furnacalis (Ofint beta 1) plays an important role in regulating the spreading of plasmatocytes The full length cDNA sequence (4477 bp) of Ofint beta 1 was cloned from hemocytes Phylogenetic analysis showed that Ofint beta 1 belonged to the integrin beta PS family of Drosophila melanogaster with highest sequence identity (78 7%) to the beta-integrin of Pseudoplusia includens Structural analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence indicated that Ofint beta 1 had similar functional domains to known beta-integrins in other lepidopteran insects RT-PCR Northern blotting Western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses showed that OfINT beta 1 was expressed mainly in hemocytes especially in plasmatocytes and weakly in fat body Malpighian tubes and epidermis After hemocytes had spread onto slides fewer antibodies to OfINT beta 1 bound to the surface of plasmatocytes Furthermore anti-OfINT beta 1 serum clearly inhibited the spreading of plasmatocytes Together these results indicate that OfINT beta 1 may play an important role in regulating the spreading of plasmatocytes (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved,38
"Nearly a half million infants in the United States are born preterm or with low birth weight each year. Providing women who have had a prior adverse birth outcome with access to family planning can help reduce the incidence of subsequent high-risk pregnancies and adverse outcomes. One effective option to prevent unintended pregnancy for women with a prior adverse birth outcome who either do not use contraception consistently or whose contraception fails is emergency contraception (EC). The purpose of our study was to understand willingness to use EC among African-American women who recently had an adverse birth outcome. The Healthy Births Healthy Communities (HBHC) Interconceptional Care Project (ICCP) targeted high-risk African-American women from two low-income Chicago neighborhoods who recently had an adverse birth outcome. The aim of HBHC ICCP was to improve participants' future birth outcomes by providing medical and social services and helping women to clarify their reproductive life goals. Information about participants' pregnancy intentions and willingness to use EC was measured in an interview shortly after enrollment into the study. Over 90 % of the 131 women in our study either did not want to become pregnant or did not know if they wanted to become pregnant within the next 2 years. These women had 4.4 times higher odds of reporting willingness to use EC as compared to women who reported a desire to become pregnant within the next 2 years (75.6 vs. 50.0 %, respectively; AOR: 4.4; 95 % CI 1.1, 17.6). EC is an essential part of the reproductive toolkit for women at high risk of adverse birth outcomes who are not intending pregnancy, along with reproductive life planning and use of effective contraception.",124
"Shape alignment or estimation under occlusion is one of the most challenging tasks in computer vision field. Most previous works treat occlusion as noises or part models, which usually lead to low accuracy or inefficiencies. This paper proposes an efficient and accurate regression-based algorithm for face alignment. In this framework, local and global regressions are iteratively used to train a series of random forests in a cascaded manner. In training and testing process, each step consists of two layers. In the first layer, a set of highly discriminative local features are extracted from local regions according to locality principle. The regression forests are trained for each facial landmark independently using those local features. Then the leaf node of the regression tree is encoded by histogram statistic method and the final shape is estimated by a linear regression matrix. In the second layer, our proposed global features are generated. Then we use those features to train a random fern to keep the global shape constraints. Experiments show that our method has a high speed, but same or slightly lower accuracy than state of the art methods under occlusion condition. In order to gain a higher accuracy we use multi-random shape for initialization, which may slightly reduce the calculation efficiency as a trade-off.",0
"The big temperature rising is the principle problem that constrains the application of the permanent magnet synchronous motors with high power density in more-electric aircrafts and all-electric aircrafts. This paper proposed a novel conception of a hybrid temperature control method using phase change material for the permanent magnet synchronous motors. The design models of a hybrid cooling casing in cylinder-shape were developed, and a prototype case optimized with paraffin as the phase change material was built. A set of experimental equipment was constructed to verify the thermal managing performance of the hybrid cooling method. The impacts of different heat loads and various working duty cycles on the cooling effectiveness of the casing were analyzed experimentally and parametrically. Results indicate that the hybrid temperature control method performs well in extending the duration of work time and decreasing the temperature rising of the motor, and the design models developed in this paper could be suitable in designing other parallel systems.

"We discuss the modeling of dielectric responses of electromagnetically excited networks which are composed of a mixture of capacitors and resistors. Such networks can be employed as lumped-parameter circuits to model the response of composite materials containing conductive and insulating grains. The dynamics of the excited network systems are studied using a state space model derived from a randomized incidence matrix. Time and frequency domain responses from synthetic data sets generated from state space models are analyzed for the purpose of estimating the fraction of capacitors in the network. Good results were obtained by using either the time-domain response to a pulse excitation or impedance data at selected frequencies. A chemometric framework based on a Successive Projections Algorithm (SPA) enables the construction of multiple linear regression (MLR) models which can efficiently determine the ratio of conductive to insulating components in composite material samples. The proposed method avoids restrictions commonly associated with Archie's law, the application of percolation theory or Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts models and is applicable to experimental results generated by either time domain transient spectrometers or continuous-wave instruments. Furthermore, it is quite generic and applicable to tomography, acoustics as well as other spectroscopies such as nuclear magnetic resonance, electron paramagnetic resonance and, therefore, should be of general interest across the dielectrics community.",45
"Folktales serve a descriptive, as well as prescriptive role, by consistently depicting societal and cultural norms. Sexist portrayals sanction the marginality of Bukusu women, particularly when these reflect prevailing gender roles and expectations. However, contests over identity and representation are as ancient as (unwritten) history. The analysis of tales From Our Mothers' Hearths: Bukusu Folktales and Proverbs, offers a wide range of role models for women; some of which depict female agency in exacting circumstances (Florence, N., 2005. From our Mothers' Hearths: Bukusu Folktales and Proverbs. NJ: Africa World Pres/The Red Sea Press). Further, females as narrators, protagonists, and the primary audience act as both curator and creators of culture.",77
"Purpose of reviewTechnological innovations, including text messaging, smart phone applications, and electronic monitoring devices, aimed at improving asthma controller adherence are being rapidly introduced both into clinical care and directly marketed to patients. This review analyzes recent clinical trials implementing these interventions, with a focus on their benefits and shortcomings.Recent findingsPoor medication adherence continues to exert significant morbidity on patients with asthma. Objective, real-time measures to monitor adherence can overcome the limitations of prior methods, including self-report and prescription refills. Technological advances, especially those incorporating reminder systems, have demonstrated improved controller adherence. The increased adherence in these trials has not translated into consistent clinical improvement, including reducing hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and asthma exacerbations, possibly secondary to study design and poor inhalation technique.SummaryNovel monitoring and reminder technology can augment patient medication adherence and provide clues to management before escalating therapy. Further studies are needed to investigate the overarching clinical impact of this technology, especially as it grows into routine clinical practice.",109
"Genetically engineered crops with insecticidal toxins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) have been planted in the world for two decades, aiming to control some major insect pests. While the Bt-crop strategy has been generally successful, a potential risk is the evolution of insect resistance to Bt crops. Modeling has been one of the main approaches to assessing the risk. To date, however, the importance of spatial heterogeneity in small-holder farm systems has not been adequately addressed. To address the question we developed and analyzed a spatially explicit model of insect population dynamics and genetics in which the proportion of Bt crops (PBt) is spatially heterogeneous (HD) or homogeneous (UD). We found that in both single- and two-locus models, the time it takes for insect to evolve regional resistance (TTR) varies among different HD patterns. The TTR could differ considerably between the case of HD and that of UD, depending on both spatial and non-spatial conditions. Under some conditions, regional evolution of resistance was much faster in the case of HD than in the case of UD. The difference between the two cases was caused by gene spread from hotspots of resistant alleles where the local PBt is much higher than average. Our results suggest that the spatial heterogeneity of PBt may significantly affect the speed of regional resistance and therefore is an important factor that should be taken into account for quantitative predictions as well as for design of resistance management strategies.

"Age is a critical factor in the prevalence of tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease. To observe how an aging phenotype interacts with and affects the pathological intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau, the tauopathy mouse model pR5 (expressing P301L mutant human tau) was back-crossed more than ten times onto a senescence-accelerated SAMP8 background to establish the new strain, SApT. Unlike SAMP8 mice, pR5 mice are characterized by a robust tau pathology particularly in the amygdala and hippocampus. Analysis of age-matched SApT mice revealed that pathological tau phosphorylation was increased in these brain regions compared to those in the parental pR5 strain. Moreover, as revealed by immunohistochemistry, phosphorylation of critical tau phospho-epitopes (P-Ser202/P-Ser205 and P-Ser235) was significantly increased in the amygdala of SApT mice in an age-dependent manner, suggesting an age-associated effect of tau phosphorylation. Anxiety tests revealed that the older cohort of SApT mice (10months vs. 8months) exhibited a behavioural pattern similar to that observed for age-matched tau transgenic pR5 mice and not the SAMP8 parental mice. Learning and memory, however, appeared to be governed by the accelerated aging background of the SAMP8 strain, as at both ages investigated, SAMP8 and SApT mice showed a decreased learning capacity compared to pR5 mice. We therefore conclude that accelerated aging exacerbates pathological tau phosphorylation, leading to changes in normal behaviour. These findings further suggest that SApT mice may be a useful novel model in which to study the role of a complex geriatric phenotype in tauopathy.",106
"Despite an improved understanding of disease biology and the use of multi-agent chemotherapy, the long-term survival of adults with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) ranges from 35% to 50%. Management of patients with relapsed B-ALL, a group characterized by dismal outcomes, poses a clinical challenge. To address this unmet need, novel therapeutics are being investigated in the setting of relapsed B-ALL with encouraging results. CD22 is an important B-cell antigen expressed in 80-90% of B-ALL cases. CD22 undergoes constitutive endocytosis with antibody ligation, making it an attractive biologic target for immunoconjugates. Inotuzumab ozogamicin (IO), a CD22-targeted antibody-drug conjugate demonstrated impressive single agent activity even among heavily pretreated relapsed B-ALL patients. A recent randomized phase III clinical trial demonstrates superiority of IO over standard of care chemotherapy as first- or second-line salvage therapy for relapsed B-ALL. In this review, we summarize the preclinical and clinical data available to date using IO in relapsed B-ALL.",7
"With the uptake of distance learning (DL), which has actually been marginal for most academics, teaching contexts, traditional power structures and relationships have been transformed, leaving lecturers potentially disenfranchised. Institutional and cultural change is vital, particularly changes concerning academic roles. The advent of DL has caused role ambiguity; however published literature related to academic roles is confusing and lacks clear guidance. For academics involved in post graduate clinical education, information is even more incomplete. Using a framework of communities, this study is a direct response to these concerns. The aim was to systematically and critically evaluate the implementation of clinical DL in an effort to improve practice. Maintaining a practitioner inquiry methodology, this study investigated the development and delivery of a new DL module. Data collection consisted of documentary analysis of meetings, interviews with staff and students, student evaluations and analytics. Data analysis incorporated both quantitative and qualitative methods to triangulate the research findings. New competencies for academics emerged, including leadership and management. Barriers to staff progress included: ambiguity in roles, lack of leadership and unpreparedness for responsibilities, time, and workload. Student barriers included: time, fear, relevance of learning, isolation and increased autonomy. Explicit planning, organisational support and working within communities were requisite to create a 'sustaining' technology. This study contributes to educational practice on two levels. Firstly, by striving for rigour, it demonstrates that practitioner inquiry is a legitimate research approach that is accessible and valuable to teachers. Secondly, it adds to useful and applied knowledge concerning DL practice. Avoiding traditional workload assumptions that are erroneous and inaccurate, this study provides new models of organisational roles and responsibilities. The results challenge the evolutionary nature of academia, suggesting working in communities and new competencies are required whilst traditional roles and culture must be redefined.",66
"Objectives:The aim of the survey was to gain understanding of women's usage patterns and attitudes towards emergency contraception (i.e., the morning after pill') and to gain insight into the role and attitudes of pharmacists as providers of emergency contraception.Methods:As part of the International Emergency Contraception Research Initiative, approximately 6500 women (15-49 years) and nearly 500 pharmacists from 14 countries in Western, Central and Eastern Europe, and Central Asia completed questionnaires via web-based interrogation or computer-assisted/paper-assisted personal interviews.Results:Common to almost all countries and cultures was that, while awareness of emergency contraception was high (84% of respondents, except in Kazakhstan), usage was generally low (4-18%). In Austria, the Czech Republic, Spain, and the UK, better underlying protection with hormonal contraceptives or male condoms would have meant less need for emergency contraception. In Bulgaria, Lithuania, Romania, and Russia, greater dependence on less reliable contraceptive methods such as calendar+withdrawal was associated with higher use of the emergency contraceptive pill (11-18%) but also with higher abortion rates (19-21%). Overt rejection of emergency contraception in the event of an accident was low, except in countries (e.g., Austria, Poland) where the misperception that it acts as an abortifacient was common. Except for Bulgaria, pharmacists elsewhere tended to have limited knowledge and moralistic attitudes towards emergency contraception.Conclusions:Improved educational efforts, probably country-specific, are required to increase the use of highly effective methods of regular contraception and overcome barriers to acceptance of emergency contraception as a suitable postcoital solution to avoid unwanted pregnancy or abortion.",124
"The synthesis of feruloyl soy glycerides was demonstrated on a pilot-scale (1 metric ton/year) in a continuous, four-column series, packed-bed, enzymatic bioreactor (herein referred to as the bioreactor). Ethyl ferulate and soybean oil were combined and converted at 3.5 kg/d over Candida antarctica lipase B immobilized on an acrylic resin (Novozym 435) at 60 degrees C. The ethyl ferulate/soybean oil substrate was fed through the four, packed-bed, enzyme columns in series with each column fitted with a recirculation pump, which improved conversion and throughput compared to smaller, batch bioreactor systems. The synthesis was carried out over 4.5 months with a single charge of enzyme to produce over 450 kg of feruloyl soy glycerides at 65% conversion. The stability of the feruloyl soy glycerides was determined by comparing the total ferulate concentration (UV absorbance), free radical scavenging (antioxidant) capacity, total acid value (hydrolysis), and Lovibond color of samples produced in 2009 to samples produced in 2015. The feruloyl soy glycerides showed no appreciable loss of UV absorbing (lambda(max) 325 nm) or rapid antioxidant capacity (50% reduction of initial radical concentration <5 min) after six years of storage. Feruloyl soy glycerides were shown to be hygroscopic over six years, but did not show any appreciable difference in total acid number due to hydrolysis or change in color. The successful pilot-scale synthesis and long term efficacy and stability of feruloyl soy glycerides was critical for the adoption of feruloyl soy glycerides as broad range UV absorbing and antoxidant ingredient by the cosmetic and skin care industries.

"The aim of this study is to analyze the relationships between maladaptive use of Internet and mobile phone and various imbalances in social skills, stress management, self' esteem and life satisfaction, and to explore differences in such uses/abuses according to socio demographic variables, such as gender and age. To do this, using a two-stage sampling of convenience with intra-group randomized downsampling, was selected 200 students (104 boys and 96 girls) aged between 12 and 17 years (M=14.34; DT = 1.637) enrolled in several secondary schools in Principado de Asturias (Spain). According to the results, it has been found that the imbalances in stress management skills predict the most likely to misuse in both technologies. Also, difficulties in managing stress and lack of communication skills, predict problematic uses of Internet -related compulsive habits, self control problems and conflicts generated by feelings. It was confirmed that girls and older adolescents suffer more problems related to mobile phone use problematic. The implications of such problematic uses are discussed and abounds in the desirability of promoting prevention and psychosocial intervention.

"Background: Low testosterone, acute and chronic stress and hypercoagulation are all associated with hypertension and hypertension-related diseases. The interaction between these factors and future risk for coronary artery disease in Africans has not been fully elucidated. In this study, associations of testosterone, acute cardiovascular and coagulation stress responses with fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor in African and Caucasian men in a South African cohort were investigated. Methods: Cardiovascular variables were studied by means of beat-to-beat and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Fasting serum-, salivary testosterone and citrate coagulation markers were obtained from venous blood samples. Acute mental stress responses were evoked with the Stroop test. Results: The African group demonstrated a higher cardiovascular risk compared to Caucasianmen with elevated blood pressure, low-grade inflammation, chronic hyperglycemia (HbA1c), lower testosterone levels, and elevated vonWillebrand factor (VWF) and fibrinogen levels. Blunted testosterone acutemental stress responses were demonstrated in African males. In multiple regression analyses, higher circulating levels of fibrinogen and VWF in Africans were associated with a low T environment (R-2 0.24-0.28; p <= 0.01), but only circulating fibrinogen in Caucasians. Regarding endothelial function, a low testosterone environment and a profile of augmented alpha-adrenergic acute mental stress responses (diastolic BP, D-dimer and testosterone) were associated with circulating VWF levels in Africans (Adj R-2 0.24; p < 0.05). Conclusions: An interdependence between acute mental stress, salivary testosterone, D-dimer and vascular responses existed in African males in their association with circulating VWF but no interdependence of the independent variables occurred with fibrinogen levels.

"This study aimed to identify and analyze the prevalence of physical and psychological family violence in a sample of children and adolescents with different categories of disabilities in a hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This was a cross-sectional observational study based on application of the Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scale in a sample of 270 parents or guardians. Prevalence was 83.7% for psychological aggression and 84.4% for physical maltreatment, while 96.5% of the children and adolescents with disabilities that suffered physical punishment were also victims of psychological aggression ( p < 0.01) and 100% of those who suffered severe physical maltreatment also suffered psychological aggression ( p = 0.01). Children and adolescents with disabilities showed increased risk of suffering family violence compared to those without disabilities. In conclusion, there is a need for greater awareness-raising and training of health teams for detection and notification of child abuse, and efforts should be made to support these families.",76
"BACKGROUND: Benign episodic unilateral mydriasis is one cause of anisocoria. This phenomenon is thought to be related to an imbalance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. There is a documented association with migraines, but asymptomatic cases have also been reported. A challenge with all cases is the level of investigation required to exclude more sinister causes of nervous system dysfunction. In a dynamic flight environment, additional considerations need to be made, such as varying light levels and use of night vision devices. CASE REPORT: A 27-yr-old woman on deployment to Afghanistan as a flight nurse presented to the role one clinic with right-sided mydriasis.The patient denied headache or any history of migraines. A dilated right pupil that was reactive to light was found on exam. Symptoms and exam findings resolved shortly after initial presentation. We consulted an ophthalmologist who requested patient transfer for review. He made a diagnosis of benign episodic unilateral mydriasis. DISCUSSION: There are a variety of causes for anisocoria. A thorough history and examination are required to avoid unnecessary investigations that may not be locally available in the more austere deployed military settings. From an operational perspective, the decision needs to be made regarding the maintenance of flight status. Consideration needs to be given to patient care capability when treating a flight nurse. In cases of rapid resolution such as this, removal from operational status is not reasonable should a clinician be confident of the diagnosis.",127
"In this work, we introduce an approach to nonlinear model predictive based on the so-called state dependent Riccati equation, SDRE. In this approach, the model is first cast in a form similar to the linear state space representation. Then the algebraic Riccati equation is constructed based on a similarity with the linear quadratic regulator to obtain stable NMPC. The method requires the solution of the Riccati equation at each sampling period. Simulation results are quite encourageing.",58
"Serotonin (5-HT) production and expression of 5-HT receptors (5-HTRs) occur early during prenatal development. Recent evidence suggests that, in addition to its classical role as a neurotransmitter, 5-HT regulates neuronal connectivity during mammalian development by modulating cell migration and neuronal cytoarchitecture. Given the variety of 5-HTRs, researchers have had difficulty clarifying the specific role of each receptor subtype in brain development. Signalling mediated by the G-protein-coupled 5-HT1AR and 5-HT7R, however, has been associated with neuronal plasticity. Thus, we hypothesized that 5-HT promotes neurite outgrowth through 5-HT1AR and 5-HT7R. The involvement of 5-HT1AR and 5-HT7R in the morphology of rat hippocampal neurons was evaluated by treating primary cultures at 2 days in vitro with 5-HT and specific antagonists for 5-HT1AR and 5-HT7R (WAY100635 and SB269970, respectively). The stimulation of hippocampal neurons with 100 nM 5-HT for 24 hr produced no effect on either the number or the length of primary neurites. Nonetheless, after 5HT(7)R was blocked, the addition of 5-HT increased the number of primary neurites, suggesting that 5HT(7)R could inhibit neuritogenesis. In contrast, 5-HT induced secondary neurite outgrowth, an effect inhibited by 1 mu M WAY-100635 or SB269970. These results suggest that both serotonergic receptors participate in secondary neurite outgrowth. We conclude that 5-HT1AR and 5-HT7R regulate neuronal morphology in primary hippocampal cultures by promoting secondary neurite outgrowth. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",75
"Oxygen plays a key role in stem cell biology as a signaling molecule and as an indicator of cell energy metabolism. Quantification of cellular oxygen kinetics, i.e. the determination of specific oxygen uptake rates (sOURs), is routinely used to understand metabolic shifts. However current methods to determine sOUR in adherent cell cultures rely on cell sampling, which impacts on cellular phenotype. We present real-time monitoring of cell growth from phase contrast microscopy images, and of respiration using optical sensors for dissolved oxygen. Time-course data for bulk and peri-cellular oxygen concentrations obtained for Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and mouse embryonic stem cell (mESCs) cultures successfully demonstrated this non-invasive and label-free approach. Additionally, we confirmed non-invasive detection of cellular responses to rapidly changing culture conditions by exposing the cells to mitochondrial inhibiting and uncoupling agents. For the CHO and mESCs, sOUR values between 8 and 60 amol cell(-1) s(-1), and 5 and 35 amol cell(-1) s(-1) were obtained, respectively. These values compare favorably with literature data. The capability to monitor oxygen tensions, cell growth, and sOUR, of adherent stem cell cultures, non-invasively and in real time, will be of significant benefit for future studies in stem cell biology and stem cell-based therapies.",31
"Background and Objectives: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic progressive inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, representing the primary cause of non-traumatic disability in young adults. Cognitive dysfunction can affect patients at any time during the disease process and might alter the six core functional domains. Social cognition is a multi-component construct that includes the theory of mind, empathy and social perception of emotions from facial, bodily and vocal cues. Deficits in this cognitive faculty might have a drastic impact on interpersonal relationships and quality of life (QoL). Although exhaustive data exist for non-social cognitive functions in MS, only a little attention has been paid for social cognition. The objectives of the present work are to reappraise the definition and anatomy of social cognition and evaluate the integrity of this domain across MS studies. We will put special emphasis on neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies concerning social cognitive performance in MS. Methods:Studies were selected in conformity with PRISMA guidelines. We looked for computerized databases (PubMed, Medline, and Scopus) that index peer-reviewed journals to identify published reports in English and French languages that mention social cognition and multiple sclerosis, regardless of publication year. We combined keywords as follows: (facial emotion or facial expression or emotional facial expressions or theory of mind or social cognition or empathy or affective prosody) AND multiple sclerosis AND (MRI or functional MRI or positron emission tomography or functional imaging or structural imaging). We also scanned references from articles aiming to get additional relevant studies. Results: In total, 26 studies matched the abovementioned criteria (26 neuropsychological studies including five neuroimaging studies). Available data support the presence of social cognitive deficits even at early stages of MS. The increase in disease burden along with the multiple disconnection syndrome resulting from gray and white matters pathology might exceed the threshold for cerebral tolerance and can manifest as deficits in social cognition. Admitting the impact of the latter on patients' social functioning, a thorough screening for such deficits is crucial to improving patients' QoL.",62
"There is accumulating evidence that bumetanide, which has been used over decades as a potent loop diuretic, also exerts effects on brain disorders, including autism, neonatal seizures, and epilepsy, which are not related to its effects on the kidney but rather mediated by inhibition of the neuronal Na-K-C1 cotransporter isoform NKCC1. However, following systemic administration, brain levels of bumetanide are typically below those needed to inhibit NKCC1, which critically limits its clinical use for treating brain disorders. Recently, active efflux transport at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) has been suggested as a process involved in the low brain:plasma ratio of bumetanide, but it is presently not clear which transporters are involved. Understanding the processes explaining the poor brain penetration of bumetanide is needed for developing strategies to improve the brain delivery of this drug. In the present study, we administered probenecid and more selective inhibitors of active transport carriers at the BBB directly into the brain of mice to minimize the contribution of peripheral effects on the brain penetration of bumetanide. Furthermore, in vitro experiments with mouse organic anion transporter 3 (Oat3)-overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary cells were performed to study the interaction of bumetanide, bumetanide derivatives, and several known inhibitors of Oats on Oat3-mediated transport. The in vivo experiments demonstrated that the uptake and efflux of bumetanide at the BBB is much more complex than previously thought. It seems that both restricted passive diffusion and active efflux transport, mediated by Oat3 but also organic anion-transporting polypeptide (Oatp) Oatpla4 and multidrug resistance protein 4 explain the extremely low brain concentrations that are achieved after systemic administration of bumetanide, limiting the use of this drug for targeting abnormal expression of neuronal NKCC1 in brain diseases.

"Background: Studies in small groups of patients indicated that splenic volume (SV) may be decreased in patients with celiac disease (CD), refractory CD (RCD) type II and enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL). Objective: The objective of this article is to evaluate SV in a large cohort of uncomplicated CD, RCD II and EATL patients and healthy controls. Methods: The retrospective cohort consisted of 77 uncomplicated CD (of whom 39 in remission), 29 RCD II, 24 EATL and 12 patients with both RCD II and EATL. The control group included 149 healthy living kidney donors. SV was determined on computed tomography. Results: The median SV in the uncomplicated CD group was significantly larger than in controls (202 cm(3) (interquartile range (IQR): 154-275) versus 183 cm(3) (IQR: 140-232), p=0.02). After correction for body surface area, age and gender, the ratio of SV in uncomplicated CD versus controls was 1.28 (95% confidence interval: 1.20-1.36; p<0.001). The median SV in RCD II patients (118 cm(3) (IQR 83-181)) was smaller than the median SV in the control group (p<0.001). Conclusion: This study demonstrates large inter-individual variation in SV. SV is enlarged in uncomplicated CD. The small SV in RCD II may be of clinical relevance considering the immune-compromised status of these patients.",7
"Body image disturbances are a prominent feature of eating disorders (EDs). Our aim was to test and evaluate a computerized assessment of body image (CABI), to compare the body image disturbances in different ED types, and to assess the factors affecting body image. The body image of 22 individuals undergoing inpatient treatment with restricting anorexia nervosa (AN-R), 22 with binge/purge AN (AN-B/P), 20 with bulimia nervosa (BN), and 41 healthy controls was assessed using the Contour Drawing Rating Scale (CDRS), the CABI, which simulated the participants' self-image in different levels of weight changes, and the Eating Disorder Inventory-2-Body Dissatisfaction (EDI-2-BD) scale. Severity of depression and anxiety was also assessed. Significant differences were found among the three scales assessing body image, although most of their dimensions differentiated between patients with EDs and controls. Our findings support the use of the CABI in the comparison of body image disturbances in patients with EDs vs. controls. Moreover, the use of different assessment tools allows for a better understanding of the differences in body image disturbances in different ED types.",67
"The, Smart Cities"" topic has recently become the topic number one in the agenda of both national and international research and development projects. This paper has been written with motivation to present various ideas of experts and professionals from an academic environment that represent different scientific fields of work such as telecommunications, control engineering, traffic engineering, information and communication technologies, etc. The authors believe that using the case of the University of Zilina (UNIZA) the multidisciplinary and synergic character of the topic may be emphasized sufficiently. Therefore a special content form of the paper has been used, based on the ""question-answer"" pattern. Traditionally prepared papers usually follow one of two possible lines: integration dimension - from research mono-thematically oriented on one technology only up to the fully integrated approach, or socio-technical dimension-from solution of purely technical problems up to the socio-technical perspectives and position of a human in the whole chain. This paper aims to raise a set of key questions representing the most urgent problems of today's smart city agenda and answers to them.",55
"Background: There is a growing global acknowledgement that improving child survival rates is no longer sufficient. Emphasis is shifting to the improvement of health and developmental trajectories in early childhood. Screening and measurement of these trajectories in low and middle income countries is difficult, however, as they currently rely on developmental tests standardised among populations of children growing up in resource rich environments. Methods: This paper presents a comparison of one such tool adapted for use with children living in Southern Africa to children from the United States, Norway, Korea and Spain. The Ages and Stages Questionnaire version 3 (ASQ-3) was adapted and administered to 853 children living in South Africa and Zambia. Results: Children in southern Africa were found to perform significantly better than children from other countries early in life, especially in the domains of communication, gross motor and fine motor skills. By the age of five, children in southern Africa were performing significantly worse than their peers in the domains of fine motor and problem-solving. Conclusion: The results indicate the applicability of the ASQ-3 in southern Africa and point to the importance of early interventions to protect the early good development of African children in order to promote positive life trajectories.",81
"In this work, we designed a Visitor Counting Machine (VCM) in terms of power efficient circuit using family of three different IO Standards which are LVTTL, Mobile DDR, HSUL_12. These three different IO Standards are compared with each other on the basis of Clock power, Logic power, Signal power, IOs, Leakage power and Total power consumption to search the most power efficient one. In order to find the most efficient circuitry, we collected the data of power consumption of these three IO standards and then compare them. We have analysed our circuitry at different frequencies of 0.1GHz, 1GHz, 10GHz & 100GHz. In our experiment, there is 99.27% power saving when 0.1GHz is used in place of 100GHz using Mobile DDR and we also concluded that when we replace LVTTL by HSUL at 10GHz Frequency, power saving of 96.10% is achieved. To design this energy efficient Visitor Counting Machine, we are using Verilog as HDL, Xilinx ISE 14.2 simulator with Artix-7 FPGA.",85
"There has been limited investigation of volume and shape difference in subcortical structures in children with ADHD and a paucity of examination of the influence of sex on these findings. The objective of this study was to examine morphology (volume and shape) of subcortical structures and their association with emotion dysregulation (ED) in girls and boys with ADHD as compared to their typically-developing (TD) counterparts. Participants included 218 children ages 8-12 years old with and without DSM-W ADHD. Structural magnetic resonance images were obtained, and shape analyses were conducted using large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM). Compared to TD boys, boys with ADHD showed reduced volumes in the bilateral globus pallidus and amygdala. There were no volumetric differences in any structure between ADHD and TD girls. Shape analysis revealed localized compressions within the globus pallidus, putamen and amygdala in ADHD boys relative to TD boys, as well as significant correlations between increased ED and unique subregion expansion in right globus pallidus, putamen, and right amygdala. Our findings suggest a sexually dimorphic pattern of differences in subcortical structures in children with ADHD compared to TD children, and a possible neurobiological mechanism by which boys with ADHD demonstrate increased difficulties with ED.",115
"The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the integration of a MOF thin film on electrostatically actuated microstructures to realize a switch triggered by gas and a sensing algorithm based on amplitude tracking. The devices are based on the nonlinear response of micromachined clamped-clamped beams. The microbeams are coated with a metal-organic framework (MOF), namely HKUST-1, to achieve high sensitivity. The softening and hardening nonlinear behaviors of the microbeams are exploited to demonstrate the ideas. For gas sensing, an amplitude-based tracking algorithm is developed to quantify the captured quantity of gas. Then, a MEMS switch triggered by gas using the nonlinear response of the microbeam is demonstrated. Noise analysis is conducted, which shows that the switch has high stability against thermal noise. The proposed switch is promising for delivering binary sensing information, and also can be used directly to activate useful functionalities, such as alarming.",51
"Purpose of reviewMultiple disease processes, including neoplasia, trauma, and medication side-effects, necessitate segmental resection and subsequent reconstruction of the mandible. As surgical techniques have advanced, several technologies have been developed with the potential to significantly transform a surgeon's approach to the restoration of mandibular continuity. The purpose of this review is to highlight many of these relatively newer tools and discuss their evolving role in mandibular reconstruction.Recent findingsSeveral contemporary studies have documented the application of different approaches and modifications to mandibular reconstruction - including computer-aided design or computer-aided modeling, contemporary plating systems, osseointegrated implants, and various modifications to existing osseocutaneous free tissue transfer options - and have reported relatively high success rates.SummaryIn discussing these reports, we present a survey of current and developing technologies in the field of mandibular reconstruction and aim to provide sufficient context for the gradual integration of these techniques into practice.",82
"Both nature and daylight have been found to positively influence health. These findings were, however, found in two separate research domains. This paper presents an overview of effects found for daylight and nature on health and the health-related concepts stress, mood, and executive functioning and self-regulation. Because of the overlap in effects found and the co-occurrence of both phenomena, the paper points to the need to consider daylight factors when investigating effects of nature and vice versa. Furthermore, the existence of possibly shared underlying mechanisms is discussed and the need to unify the research paradigms and dependent variables used between the two research fields. Last, in view of the beneficial effects of both phenomena on health, our objective is to raise awareness amongst the general public, designers, and health practitioners to use these naturally available phenomena to their full potential.",71
"Ependymomas represent 10% of pediatric brain tumors. In the recent WHO 2016 classification, pathology is enriched by localization and molecular biology. Whatever the age, total removal by one or several looks when required remains a major prognostic factor. In children, focal radiation remains a standard, while the role of chemotherapy is matter of randomized studies. In infants, front line chemotherapy is the standard. Inclusion in the SIOP ependymoma II protocol is encouraged. In case of relapse, further surgery and radiation are advised, while inclusion in innovative trials including re-irradiation, and phase I-II should be encouraged. A better understanding of underlying mechanisms of ependymoma cell will provide in the close future, the key to use targeted therapies at time of relapse, and very soon as first line therapy for some subgroups of patients.",30
"Renewable energy projects in Korea have two avenues that provide subsidies to increase their financial viability. Feed-in-Tariffs (FITs) offer cost based prices for renewable electricity to compete with conventional energy producers. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) issues certified emission reduction (CER) credits that generate additional revenues, enhancing renewable projects' return on investment. This study investigated how these subsidies impact the financial returns on Korea's CDM projects. An investment analysis was performed on four cases including solar, hydropower, wind and landfill gas projects. Revenues from electricity sales, FITs and CERs were compared using financial indicators to measure their relative contributions on profitability. Results indicate that CDM is partial towards large scale projects with high emission reductions. Moreover, conflicts with FIT schemes can deter small scale, capital intensive projects from pursuing registration. The analysis highlights CDM's bias for particular project types, which is in part due to its impartiality towards carbon credit prices. It also reveals that Korea, a key benefactor of CDM, is susceptible to such biases, as demonstrated by the disproportionate distribution of issued CERs. Improving incentives for bundled, small scale projects, CER price differentiation, and excluding domestic subsidies during additionality testing are proposed as possible reforms.",43
"Planar graph navigation is an important problem with significant implications to both point location in geometric data structures and routing in networks. However, whilst a number of algorithms and existence proofs have been proposed, very little analysis is available for the properties of the paths generated and the computational resources required to generate them under a random distribution hypothesis for the input. In this paper we analyse a new deterministic planar navigation algorithm with constant spanning ratio (w.r.t the Euclidean distance) which follows vertex adjacencies in the Delaunay triangulation. We call this strategy cone walk. We prove that given n uniform points in a smooth convex domain of unit area, and for any start point z and query point q; cone walk applied to z and q will access at most O(vertical bar zq vertical bar root n + log(7) n) sites with complexity O(vertical bar zq vertical bar root n log log n + log(7) n) with probability tending to 1 as n goes to infinity. We additionally show that in this model, cone walk is (log(3+xi) n)-memoryless with high probability for any pair of start and query point in the domain, for any positive xi. We take special care throughout to ensure our bounds are valid even when the query points are arbitrarily close to the border. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",41
"New imaging techniques enable visualizing and analyzing a multitude of unknown phenomena in many areas of science at high spatio-temporal resolution. The rapidly growing amount of image data, however, can hardly be analyzed manually and, thus, future research has to focus on automated image analysis methods that allow one to reliably extract the desired information from large-scale multidimensional image data. Starting with infrastructural challenges, we present new software tools, validation benchmarks and processing strategies that help coping with large-scale image data. The presented methods are illustrated on typical problems observed in developmental biology that can be answered, e.g., by using time-resolved 3D microscopy images.",101
