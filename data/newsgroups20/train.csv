Dear NettersI want to send EMG-signals from a running person to a computer. Each signal is 4KHz wide and there is up to 30 of them on eachrunning person. The signal is only to be sent over a few hundred meters. It seems to me that the frequency intended for this use isabout 150MHz and about 440MHz.To make the transmitters as light as possible I suppose it will be best the to send the signals in an analog form. As this application is rather specialized I do not expect to be able to buy the exact transmitter-units i need.On the other hand I imagine that I can buy the receiver somewhere. I need a multichannel (up to 30 channels) receiver or 30 complete  receivers in some rack system where one can add as many receivers as needed in the particular case.DO ANYBODY KNOW IF THERE IS EXISTING SUCH RECEIVER SYSTEM ON THE MARKET?,4

In comparison, in the United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall decreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in gonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of this disease from 1985 through 1992.      In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department of Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992, reported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively (Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics (15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases with race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% of all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by age groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or equal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all reported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the largest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age group-specific rate (639 per 100,000).      Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver metropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the state (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area occurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods considered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity.      When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among men in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in the Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits by males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases diagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised 94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among self-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992, respectively).      Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO, university hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted to determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased 23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the fourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning).      From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and Hispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993increased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado increased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992, the gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for whites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000) (Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from 1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases increased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups. Reported by: KA Gershman, MD, JM Finn, NE Spencer, MSPH, STD/AIDS Program; RE Hoffman, MD, State Epidemiologist, Colorado Dept of Health. JM Douglas, MD, Denver Dept of Health and Hospitals. Surveillance and Information Systems Br, Div of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center for Prevention Svcs, CDC. Editorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992 may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH surveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea cases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact. However, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning laboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population.      One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a recent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs (2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area coincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires further assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) -- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs, and gang affiliation.      The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the national health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective 19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for gonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at greatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race-specific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as socioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors.      In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado, interventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting partner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at increased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black males); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993announcements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in schools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted primarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to perform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational interventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of members of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders and health-care providers.

Child safety seats and safety belts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50 states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety belts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by an estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major cause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for those aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In addition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to use restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between adult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints for the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC analyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this study.      Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to 18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based, random-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury Control and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499 (26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent was asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for that child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in this analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than consistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up). Data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates and confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined by p values of less than 0.05.      Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six (Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no law requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse of safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a safety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993laws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use. The analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law requiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law (no-law states).      Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not consistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and adult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square test) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus 43.2%, respectively).      High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than consistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported high rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age (range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for adults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child-occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% for 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of consistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult safety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age groups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year).      Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded that in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition, higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with increased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated with increased adult safety-belt use (8). Reported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC. Editorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit other risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater risk for motor-vehicle injury (10).      Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with child restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such programs should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve low-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are directed at parents with young children.      Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In addition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993they become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment, those who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do not have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and safety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the highest rate of fatal crashes (5).

SURVEILLANCE FOR AND COMPARISON OF BIRTH DEFECT PREVALENCES                               IN TWO GEOGRAPHIC                         AREAS -- UNITED STATES, 1983-88      Problem/Condition: CDC and some states have developed surveillance systems to monitor the birth prevalence of major defects.      Reporting Period Covered: This report covers birth defects surveillance in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, and selected jurisdictions in California for the years 1983-1988.      Description of System: The California Birth Defects Monitoring Program and the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program are two population-based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods. The prevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983-1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan Atlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race, sex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression.      Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal alcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the kidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general diagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand limb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these defects are relatively easy to diagnose.      Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However, the reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be related to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene pool, or random variation.      Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several collaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in the birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on the impact of prenatal diagnosis.

INFLUENZA -- UNITED STATES, 1988-89     Problem/Condition: CDC monitors the emergence and spread of new influenza virus variants and the impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality annually from October through May.      Reporting Period Covered: This report covers U.S. influenza surveillance conducted from October 1988 through May 1989.      Description of System: Weekly reports from the vital statistics offices of 121 cities provided an index of influenza's impact on mortality; 58 WHO collaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza viruses; weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and territorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians. Nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received throughout the year.      Results: During the 1988-89 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1) and B viruses were identified in the United States with essentially equal frequency overall, although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted over the course of the season. Throughout the season increases in the indices of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were similar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of identified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype increased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the 1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were reported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza A(H1N1).      Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of influenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A.      Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced throughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make informed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual surveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates for inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons. Authors: Louisa E.

Copyright 1993, The University of Arizona                 High Tech Assisted Reproductive TechnologiesFollowing the birth of the first in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) baby in 1978, a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been developed that include IVF-ET, gamete intrafallopian tube transfer (GIFT), embryo cryopreservation (freezing) and gamete micromanipulation. Together, these technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive technology (ART) procedures. Ovulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility management. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to proceed with one of the ART procedures. Therefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility service at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in ART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients in the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the traditional therapies. The following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our Center, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the realistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are: o in vitro o fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube   transfer o (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation. This article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed towards improved success of these technologies.

This technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization. There are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by other centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and hemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ hybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit sex-linked disorders. The considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth of affected children.

In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our Assisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of unfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and the culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred to the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being processed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993assisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to perform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically stimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo lupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs obtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia, we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our Infertility Unit, with the patient sedated.       Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal deficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male factor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall success rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per cycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 IVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate.      Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well recognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous ovarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle attempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant of conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an Assisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of traditional therapies.      The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not been clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs available for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; and 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our Center, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may be impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently, the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy.      GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room, usually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian tube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization occurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF, with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for transfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in HICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26Volume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993which there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility and/or idiopathic infertility.         The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990 indicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained with the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36 percent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might expect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our program we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while substantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the patient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing a procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing general anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs, and the developmental competency of resultant embryos.      The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial environment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between January 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT cycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent.      Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when embryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos. This procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for success at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated by the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from both a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys.      Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new, is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but who have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in combination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10 percent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the procedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under the coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm through enzymatic digestion.      Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 percent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm. Therefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to establish conception.

"There is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today'sLA Times (Thursday April 15, 1993, p. D1).  I thought I'd post it tostir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it bysaying that I largely agree that the ""Space Age"" in the romantic senseof several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space stationmiss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, ""What's New"" -the weekly physics update we get here on the net - it's clear that theromance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation ofmatter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (withits spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing thingspeople are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, Ithink, the romance some people still have with space is a matter ofnostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our ""mindchildren"" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); butI think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting aboutwhat we can do *now*.

To be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologiesfor telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probeswould be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver ofscientific and industrial innovation is now dead......Before the change in administrations, it would have been foolish towrite an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressivelysupported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billionto build space station Freedom alone.Even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspokenpublic champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that muchof the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescopeto the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressivelyimplemented did not seem to matter much.Political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherentvision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollarspace budgets.Indeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apolloera is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space explorationwith programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  ......While the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded DanielGoldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration, it seems clear that space exploration is not beingpositioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America'stechnological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - beenslashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration championsits competitiveness agenda.......",6

"Archive-name: atheism/introductionAlt-atheism-archive-name: introductionLast-modified: 5 April 1993Version: 1.2-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----                          An Introduction to Atheism                       by mathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk>This article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism.  Whilst Ihave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, youshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  Iwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; somerelevant books are listed in a companion article.To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this articleas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All thequestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been croppedup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some otherfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questionsposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflectquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christianswho proselytize on alt.atheism.So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such asChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divinebeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of itmay not.""What is atheism?""Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former isoften referred to as the ""weak atheist"" position, and the latter as ""strongatheism"".It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  ""Weakatheism"" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  ""Strongatheism"" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do notfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are ""strong atheists"".Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit theiratheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than makingflat-out denials.""But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?""Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believeit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent tobelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true ornot.  Which brings us to agnosticism.""What is agnosticism then?""The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of theMetaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone whodisclaimed (""strong"") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of thingsmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know forsure whether God exists.Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming thatyou can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the factthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many peopleuse agnosticism to mean ""weak atheism"", and use the word ""atheism"" only whenreferring to ""strong atheism"".Beware also that because the word ""atheist"" has so many shades of meaning, itis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say forsure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn'tthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find outabout the universe.""So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?""There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why aparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religionsis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible thatsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because theysee no evidence that God exists.""But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?""There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it isquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger thanall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objectsobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarlywell-defined is a matter for debate.However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provablyimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence ofGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible toshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing inquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalidmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thingmight be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search isoften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largestprimes, because we can prove that they don't exist.Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not existunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most ofthe time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusivelyprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot betested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be toprove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes bydefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of Godexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to covervarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst itmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may bepossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religiousbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God describedby any present-day religion exists.In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is veryclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently differentthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind ofGod are not really applicable.""But what if God is essentially non-detectable?""If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interactionmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must bedetectable.If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that hedoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would arguethat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of noimportance whether he exists or not.If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.Surely he should still be detectable today?Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientificallyverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive someeffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish himfrom all the other things that don't exist?""OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but isn't it still a religious belief?""One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is ""theredefinition game"".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:Person A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points outthat it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in thestatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  Hethen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed toit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an ""agreed fact"", butuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscureredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seento be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.The point of this digression is that the answer to the question ""Isn'tatheism a religious belief?"" depends crucially upon what is meant by""religious"".  ""Religion"" is generally characterized by belief in a superhumancontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith andworship.[ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not  ""religion"" according to such a definition. ]Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is itcategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of""religious"" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects ofhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as ""religious"" as well -- such asscience, politics, and watching TV.""OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is still just an act of faith, like religion is?""Firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something oneactually believes in.Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions tomake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheiststry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject toquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generallyassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These arethe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called""acts of faith"", then almost everything we know must be said to be based onacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts offaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic asreligious followers when claiming that something is ""certain"".  This is not ageneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant tostate with certainty that the universe exists.Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.Sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheismhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, aseven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (orthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.""If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?""It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either ""for"" or""against"", ""friend"" or ""enemy"".  The truth is not so clear-cut.Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,it can be said to be ""anti-religion"".  However, when religious believersspeak of atheists being ""anti-religious"" they usually mean that the atheistshave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.Most atheists take a ""live and let live"" attitude.  Unless questioned, theywill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Ofcourse, this may be in part because atheism is not ""socially acceptable"" inmany countries.A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to ""convert"" otherswhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made littleimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.(To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separationof church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free toworship as they wished.  The institution of ""state atheism"" came about whenStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches inorder to gain complete power over the population.)Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they seereligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned thatchurch and state should remain separate.""But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state, surely that's the same as state atheism?""The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shallnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, itmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense ofanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious innature.Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  Forexample, religious believers have historically been responsible forencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizationscampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded asreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheistsare quite happy to see them have their say.""What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people pray?""Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do thingsthat those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer inschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that theyneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief meansthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will beacceptable to all those present at any public event.Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonableto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without othermotives.""You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't atheists object to the religious charities?""There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists cancontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, forthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary workfor charities founded on a theistic basis.Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about inconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everydaymatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to sayself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular setof religious beliefs.To ""weak"" atheists, building a hospital to say ""I do not believe in God"" is arather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say ""Today is not mybirthday"".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.""You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?""Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt toforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those peoplechoose to call themselves atheists.It's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as abacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On theother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to theexpectations of others.On the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion arebacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to goalong with a group rather than act or think independently.""How do atheists differ from religious people?""They don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer aVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (ManyBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copyof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!Whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists withoutrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour andappearance.""Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?""That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of courseatheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when onetalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (""right"") and unacceptable(""wrong"") behaviour within society.Humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they mustco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage mostatheists from ""anti-social"" or ""immoral"" behaviour, purely for the purposesof self-preservation.Many atheists behave in a ""moral"" or ""compassionate"" way simply because theyfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they carewhat happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.Naturally, there are some people who behave ""immorally"" and try to useatheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people whobehave ""immorally"" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify theiractions.  For example:  ""Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,   be honor and glory forever and ever.""The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992by Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,Wisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is areligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior   deteriorated after ""born again"" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents   said they had driven intoxicated before being ""born again,"" 12% had done   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex   before salvation; 5% after.                                [""Freethought Today"", September 1991, p. 12.]So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moralbehaviour.""Is there such a thing as atheist morality?""If you mean ""Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?"", then theanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about moralitywhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.If you mean ""Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?"", then the answeris no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a personwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same ""moral rules"" as theists,but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created byhumans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, ratherthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.""Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?""A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of theatheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work forthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatiblewith what they observed around them.Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they areunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent timestudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They havemade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.This decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of thatindividual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choiceof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the onlychoice that person can honestly make.""But don't atheists want to believe in God?""Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Manyof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the""Big Brother"" figure might be.Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Shouldone believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks ofsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting tobelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.""But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are unwilling in their souls to see!""Many, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explainedabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that Godexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.Of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming thatall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.Comments such as ""Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly""are likely to be viewed as patronizing.Certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it isvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they arebeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are notwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate isfutile.""Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?""Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think givesmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their livescount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on otherpeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life topolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.It is a natural human tendency to look for ""meaning"" or ""purpose"" in randomevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that ""life"" is the sort of thingthat has a ""meaning"".To put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actuallya sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking ""What is themeaning of life?"" is as silly as asking ""What is the meaning of a cup ofcoffee?"".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.""So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?""There are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.Or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but sowhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, orshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?In the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists areunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely becauseit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and considerthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's justhard luck.""Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?""The short answer is ""No, do you?""Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered manyarguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they havefound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.Thousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof ofthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikelyto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.""So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments apply?""No, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism isthe sceptical ""default position"" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheismis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefsbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,but to everyone else.""What sort of harm?""Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's notjust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.Imagine how that effort could be better spent.Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instancesof ill people being ""healed"" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicinesprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have diedbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.It is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- andcondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in manythird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather thanallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a differentreligion.""Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some sort of excuse.""What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hardto tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, allconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fightand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REALChristian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like theCatholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?In the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone whocalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify hisactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christiansare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely ifthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't bemuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he havemade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefsaren't a perversion of what your God intended?If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then whyshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?Sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murderedothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him aChristian.""Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.""That does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently muchharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicornsdon't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default thanit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, ""weak"" atheistswould argue that asserting nothing is better still.""Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?""Unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how ""correct""it is, or whether it ""works""; consider how many people believe in astrology,graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe ingods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows thepeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.Of course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even whenthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have startedas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves otherpurposes as well.""But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say something?""Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it'sworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort ofconcept of God in the Christian sense.Of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it'srather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.""What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that God exists?""For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one whodoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief isnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important torealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in thesame way that theists view their religious leaders.A famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, butwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Manyrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking onsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.""So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothing?""Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question hasproperties which have helped it so spread so far.The theory of memetics talks of ""memes"" -- sets of ideas which can propagatethemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists viewreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread byencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction bydiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressureto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Somereligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled byother memes.Of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated withsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because ofthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thingbecause of the number of people who have caught it.""Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?""There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just afew of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in somereligions.   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to   find it.   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.   Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.   It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change   yourself.   Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.   If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.   Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.and finally (and most importantly):   All beliefs should be open to question.Thanks for taking the time to read this article.mathew-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: 2.2iQCVAgUBK8AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY4g7ge8Mo5wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO7ltVtMVTu66Nz6sBbPw9QkbjArbY/S2sZ9NF5htdii0R6SsEyPl0R6/9bV9okE/qnihqnzXE8pGvLt7tlez4EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT54yQqGb4HARbOEHDcrTe2atmPq0Z4hSSPpAU==q2V5-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----",0
"[stuff deleted]Ah, clarification by obfuscation.Actually, the words ""A well regulated Milita, being necessary to thesecurity of a free state"" is a present participle, used as anadjective to modify 'militia', which is followed by the main clause ofthe sentence, the subject being 'the right', the verb 'shall'.  Itasserts that the right to keep and bear arms is essential formaintaining a milita.  The sentence doesn't restrict the right, orstate or imply possession of the right by anyone or anything otherthan the people.  All it does is make a positive statement regarding aright of the people. The PEOPLE, as in you and me, as in the First,Fourth, Ninth, Tenth, as well as the Second amendment.The existence of this right is assumed - it is not granted by theamendment.

"Someone sent me this FAQ by E-mail and I post my response here.[I'm not enforcing the inclusion limits on this FAQ because mostof our readers probably haven't seen it.  --clh]Christ warns that anyone who ""breaks one of the least of thesecommandments *and* teaches otheres to do the same will be called least inthe kingdom of heaven"" (Matt. 5:19.  This FAQ is so full of error that Imust respond to it.  I hope that whoever maintains will remove from it thepartisan theology.1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom4:15 notes that ""where no law is, there is no transgression.""  Not onlydid sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before itwas revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promisewhich undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of thepeople, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised""what ever He says to do we will do.""  That is why the new covenant isbased on ""better promises"" (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the lawGod promised to ""put my laws in their minds and write them on theirhearts"" (Heb. 8:10).3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  TheSabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempthad been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have beeneven more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weeklySabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur atany time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was*added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).4.  Israel stands for God's people of all time.  That is why God *grafted*the Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, thecovenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promisesbelong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being borninto Israel is not enough ""For they are not all Israel, which are ofIsrael"" v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says ""if ye be Christ's, then are yeAbraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.""  All Christians areAbraham's seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not thecriterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on thepromise God made to all his people the Israelites.People would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbathcommandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates theceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Evenif you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagansun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed,sanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leadersagree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions insoc.religion.christian.bible-study).I do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what Godsays.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law,why is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is theSabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was importantenough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note thatthe message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law butfreed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then incourt I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives megrace, do I walk out of the court saying ""I can now go on speeding, for Iam now under grace?""  Being under grace I now drive within the speedlimit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 ""Di we then make void the law throughfaith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law.""  ""Wherefore the law isholy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good"" (Rom. 7:12).Do you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 showsthat the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul didnot go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot toAssos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate ""lay by him in store""with ""go to a worship service.""Wrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbathday of the moral law.Why would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different argumentswhich conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from aGod who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law couldnot be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of abroken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for lawbreaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not tofollow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin tomake false gods, to violate God's name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, tokill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weightwhen placed next to the word of God.Darius[It's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  Ithink Paul's comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) isprobably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doingwhat he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equallyaccept that those who ""esteem all days alike"" are similarly doingtheir best to honor the Lord.However I'd like to be clear that I do not think there's unambiguousproof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As Iindicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.The difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actuallyabout something else.  They both look like they are talking aboutnnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says ""and theygathered every Sunday for worship"".  We get various pieces ofinformation, but nothing aimed at answering this question.  Act 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish templeworship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously thetemple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example ofChristians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesn't tell uswhat day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius'confusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see noreason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when theBiblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies tome that this was a normal meeting.  It doesn't say they gathered tosee Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread,Paul talked about his upcoming travel.  But that's just not explicitenough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It saysthat on the first day they should set aside money for Paul'scollection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered speciallyto do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can't disprove it,but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would bewhen they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to doit in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day.So I think the most obvious reading of this is that ""on the first dayof every week"" simply means every time they gather for worship.  I think the reason we have only implications and not clear statementsis that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christianworship was.",7

"Yes, I do.    My argument is that the sole purpose of the death penalty is to  kill people.  That is it's primary (and I would argue only)  purpose.  To continue to kill people by a practice that has  almost no utility, especially when you know you will be killing  innocents, is unconscionable.  At the very least, the existence of the prison system and our  transportation system are based on their merits to society, not  their detriments.  We are willing to accept a few lost innocent  lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued  existence of these systems.  One has to stretch the evidence and  the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment.  Just in case I wasn't clear again:  We maintain a capital  punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides us with  no net positive gain.  Why?

"Unfortunatly, this seems to be how Christians are taught to think whenit comes to their religion. Some take it to the extreme and say thattheir religion is the ONLY one and if you don't accept their teachingsthen you won't be ""saved"". It takes quite a bit of arrogance to claimto know what God thinks/wants. Especially when it's based upon yourinterpretation of a book. The logic in the above statement is faultyin that it assumes two people with differing beliefs can't both becorrect. It's all about perception. No two people are exactly alike.No two people perceive everything in the same way. I believe thatthere is one truth. Call it God's truth, a universal truth, or call itwhat you will. I don't believe God presents this truth. I think it isjust there and it's up to you to look for and see it, through prayer,meditation, inspir- ation, dreams or whatever. Just because people mayperceive this truth differently, it doesn't mean one is wrong and theother is right. As an example, take the question, ""Is the glass halfempty or half full""?

I moved there fromNovosibirsk. My son entered the Baku Nautical School, and so I transferredto Azerbaijan. Later I met someone and married him, and now my name isArutunian, my husband's name . . .That there would be a massacre was not discussed openly, but there were hints and gibes, so to speak, at the Armenian people, and they were mocking the Russians, too. I was constantly aware of it at work, and not just this past year. I couldn't find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because I, I'll just say it, couldn't steal, couldn't deceive, and couldn't be involved in bribe-taking. And when I asked for decent working conditions they told me, ""Leave, don't keep the others from working, you aren't cut out for this kind of work."" And at work and around all the time I would hear gibes at the Armenians, like ""The Turks had it right, they killed them all--the waythey've multiplied here they're making it hard for us to live,"" and ""Things will be just fine if we get rid of them all."" ""No problem, the Turks will help,"" they say, ""if we ask them, they'll rid Armenia of Armenians in half an hour."" Well that's the way it all was, but I never thought, of course that it would spill over into a bloody tragedy, because you just couldn't imagine it. Here we've been living under the Soviet government for 70 years, and no one even considered such an idea possible.But I had been forming my own opinions, and in the presence of authoritative people I would often ask, ""Where is this all leading, do people really not seewhat kind of situation is emerging here. The Russians are fleeing Sumgait, there are very few of them left. Why is no one dealing with this, what's goingon?"" And when it all happened on the 27th and 28th, it became clear that everything had been arranged by someone, because what else are you to make of it if the First Secretary of the City Party Committee is marching ahead of thedemonstration with an Azerbaijani flag? I wouldn't be saying this now if I hadn't received personal confirmation from him later. Because when we were under guard in the SK club on the 1st, he came to the club, that Muslimzade. The women told me, ""There he is, there he is, that's Muslimzade."" I didn't believe the rumors that he had carried an Azerbaijani flag. I thought that they were just false rumors. I went over to him and said, ""Are you the First Secretary of our City Party Committee?"" He answers me, ""Yes."" And I ask him, ""Tell me, did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an Azerbaijani flag, and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs, I don't know exactly what they said, but there was mention of Armenian blood?"" And he tellsme, ""Yes, I was there, but I tried to dissuade them from it."" Then I asked himanother question: ""And where were you when they were burning and slaughtering us? And he said, ""I. . . We didn't know what to do, we didn't know, we didn't anticipate that that would happen in Sumgait.""Comrade Mamedov, the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijani SSR, answered the same question for me: ""No, we actually didn't anticipate the slaughter in Sumgait. At that time we were trying to contain the crowd of 45,000 in Baku that was preparing for a massacre."" Those are his exact words, the ones he said in the office of the Council of Ministers of theArmenian SSR.And now, about the events themselves. Of course it's painful to discuss them, because it may seem that it's not true to someone else. Various rumors concerning what happened are making the rounds: some are true, others aren't. But unfortunately there are more true ones than false, because it was so horrible: in our age, here in the space age, the age of science, the age ofprogress, I don't know, if someone had told me this story, if I were living inor around Moscow, I wouldn't have believed it. Why not? Because it was really a genocide, it was a massacre. That's genuinely what it was.For example, on that day, the 28th--I didn't know about the 27th because my husband and I were both sick, both of us had the flu, and we were in bed--on the 28th our neighbor comes to our place and says, ""You're in bed? You don't know anything about it? There was a demonstration in town, and after it they were overturning Armenian cars and burning them. They were looking into cars and asking, 'Are you an Armenian?' If they answered in Armenian, then they turned the car over and burned it."" This isn't made up, the wife of the SeniorInvestigator of the Baku Ministry of Internal Affairs told us. He was returning home from his dacha with his wife, Raisa Sevastyanova, she's my neighbor. She immediately came and told LIS that they had landed right in the middle of it, I don't know what to call it, the cavalcade of automobiles they were stopping. He answered in Azerbaijani, they let them go, but they made himhonk the horn, they were kicking up a fracas. We didn't even believe it, and I said, ""Certainly that didn't happen, how can that be?"" And she said, ""Muslimzade was leading the crowd, and the Sputnik store was completelysmashed because most of the salespeople there are Armenians. And when he saw that they had started breaking the glass in that store, he said, ""Don't break the shop windows, don't destroy state property, but do whatever else you want."" I didn't hear this with my own two ears, but it is a fact that the store wastorn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing Armenians although he's an Azerbaijani.While we were talking, all of a sudden right across from us . . . Sevastyanovais the first to look out the window and say, ""Look, there's a crowd out there."" And sure enough, when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had already started wrecking the neighboring building. There was an Armenian family there, a woman and two girls. They lived across from us. I'm sorry, I don't know the building number or the people's names, since we were in my husband's apartment, in Microdistrict 8, and I lived in Microdistrict No. 3. There was awful looting going on there at the time, the most hideous things were going on there then. One building there, ours, was attacked twice, once wasn't enough for them. They returned to the places where they hadn't finishedthe Armenians off. If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians, they beat the Azerbaijanis too. They also beat Russians, if it was Russians doing the hiding. Because there were Russians among them, they said so on television, there were people of various nationalities. But they didn't tell us why there were people of different nationalities. Because they wouldn't have touched the Azerbaijanis if they hadn't dared to stick up for the Armenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes.At the time I saw this from the window I was there, Sevastyanova was there, and so was my husband. We went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly off a balcony. All kinds of things, even a sofa. Then, when it was all down there, they burned it up. Then we saw the crowd, and they were all oohing. At first I couldn't figure out what was happening. And later I told my husband, ""Lendrush, l think they're beating someone out there."" And he answered, ""I don't know, could be."" Suddenly the crowd separated for a moment, and I saw it, and Raisa Sevastyanova saw it too. My husband had turned the other way, he didn't see it. I saw a naked girl with her hair down. They were dragging her. She kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her. She fell down, it was muddy there, and later other witnesses who saw it from their balconies told us, they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of blocks, as far as the mortgage bank, that's a good block and a half or two from here. I know this for sure because I saw it myself.Then the crowd rushed toward our building. We were standing there, and you canof course imagine what we were feeling. Were they going to kill us or not? AndI also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormentedthat woman, because I had just seen that.I asked my husband. I gave him an axe and said, ""You kill me first, and then let them do what they want with the corpse."" But our neighbors, it's true, defended us, they said, ""There aren't any Armenians in our entryway, go away, only Muslims live here."" Disaster missed us that time.But at two o'clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people, approximately, came back to our place. My husband was already asleep. He can sleep when he's upset about something, but I can't. I was standing, running from balcony to balcony. Our power was out, I don't remember for how long, but it was as though it had been deliberately turned off. There were no lights whatsoever, and I was glad, of course. I thought it was better that way. But then I look and the crowd is at our balcony. This was at 2:15 in the morning. The first time they were at our building it was 6:30, and now it was 2:15 in the morning. But I never thought that that old woman on the first floor, the Azerbaijani, was awake and watching out, there were human beings among them too. So she goes out with a pail of garbage, as though she needed to be takinggarbage out at two o'clock in the morning. She used it as a pretext and went toward those young people. They really were youngsters. From my balcony you could see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys. They spoke Azerbaijani. And when they came up to her she said, ""What do you want?"" And they answered, ""We want the Armenian family that lives here"" [pointing toward the second floor with their hands]. She says, ""I already told you, we don't have any Armenians here, now leave, do you hear, this is an old Muslim woman talking to you,"" and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk aroundher and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away. And so they seemed to listen to her. They were all very young, they started apologizing and left. That was the second time death was at our door.I forgot to mention about one other apartment, a man named Rubik lives there, I don't know him really, I knew his daughter, I mean I saw her around, but we really didn't know them. But I do know that that guy who lives on the fourth floor across from our entryway went to Chernobyl and worked there for eight months, to earn money. Can you imagine what that means? He risked his life to earn X amount of money in order to better his family. He bought new furniture and was getting ready to give his daughter's hand in marriage, but, alas,everything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels. They threw everything out the windows, and the rest we saw from our balcony: how the neighbors on the left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that hadn't already been smashed or taken. What is one to think of that? It means that the parents in those families were in on it too. Unfortunately I came to be of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been foreseen in advance: both the beating of the Armenians and the stripping of apartments. Something on the order of ""We'll move the Armenians out and take over their apartments.""I have worked honestly my whole life, you can check everything about me. I came as a patriot from China, waited for nights on end in front of the Consulate General of the USSR, I came to my homeland as a patriot because I knew that the Party and the Komsomol were holy things. But when I saw in Sumgait that there wasn't anything holy about them, that Party membership was bought, that Komsomol members joined only for personal gain, that there were no ideals, no ideas, God save me, everything was being bought and sold, I saw all of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did.I can't talk any more about it . . . the image of that beating . . . When Iwent out of my own apartment--they picked us up under Soviet Army guard, they had arrived from all over to suppress that gang--not only Armenians, but some Russian families and their children, too, came out of their apartments andjoined us, because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with the situation the way it was. And what's interesting is that when we left on the buses I rode and thought that at least one group of people, for sure people would basically rise to the situation, would have some compassion for the Armenians, would somehow understand the injustice of what was done. But having analyzed and weighed the whole thing, once I calmed down, having thought it all through, I came to a conclusion that is shared by many people. If a lot of Azerbaijanis didn't want their Armenian neighbors to be killed, and that basically depended on that Muslimzade--he said that he had wanted to calm them down--then is it possible that he didn't have people at hand to whomhe could whisper at the last minute, ""Go and announce it on television: Citizens of Sumgait! Take what you can into your hands, let's protect our neighbors from this massacre?"" Those crowds weren't such that there was no controlling them. Basically they were unarmed. They didn't have firearms, mostly they had knives, they had all kinds of metal parts, like armature shafts, sharpened at the ends, special rocks, different to a degree that we noticed them: there aren't rocks like those in Sumgait soils, they were brought from somewhere, as though it were all specially planned. So as I was saying, I weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend us, why wasn't it arranged? It means that the government didn't want to do it. When the crowd was moving from the City Party Committee to the Sputnik, what, there was no way of informing Baku? No, there was no way, it turns out!The crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict. I won't mention the things I didn't see myself, I'll only talk about the things I myself witnessed. They were in Microdistrict 8 beginning at 6 o'clock in the evening, when I saw themfrom the other building, and they were somewhere else until mid-night or one o'clock in the morning, because at 2:15 they came back to our building. Theyhadn't completely finished making their predatory rounds of Microdistrict 8. When they returned to our building I told my husband, ""Lendrush, now the police are probably going to come, my God, now the authorities are probably going to find out and come to our aid."" Well, alas, no, there were to be no authorities, not a single policeman, not a single fireman, not a single ambulance came while they were raging, as it turns out, as we later found out,beginning on the Might of the 27th. There were dead people, ruined apartments,and burned autos: one car near the bus station, it was burned and overturned, it was probably there about four days, everyone saw it and what went on in Block 45! Those who live there know, they saw from their balconies how they attacked the soldiers in the buses, how they beat those poor, unarmedsoldiers, and how on that square, I can't remember the name of it, where thereis that fork coming from the bus station, that intersection, now I'm upset andI can't think of the name . . . there's a tall building there, a 9-story, and from the balconies there people saw that butchery, when the poor soldiers, wearing only helmets, with shields and those unfortunate clubs, moved against that mob. And when they fell, those 12-to 14-year-old boys ran up and using stones, big heavy stones, beat them to death on their heads. Who could have guessed that something like that could happen in the Soviet Union and under the Soviet government? The upshot is that this republic has not been under Soviet control for a long time, but no one wanted to pay any attention or get involved.If you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that I tell thetruth, I've been struggling for truth for five years there already, the five years that I worked at the Azerbaijani railroad. Some people there considered me a demagogue, others who knows what; some think I'm an adventure seeker, andsome, a prankster. But I wanted everything to be right, I would becomeoutraged: how can this be, why is it people treat one another this way on a Soviet railroad, as though the Azerbaijani railroad were Azerbaijani property,or the property of some magnate, or some ""mafia"": If I want to, I'll get you out of here; If I want to, I'll get rid of you; If I want to, I'll do something else? And there's a black market price for everything, in the most brazen way: a coach to Moscow costs so much, a coach on a local train costs somuch. Once when I was complaining to the head of the conductor's pool, he had the nerve to tell me, maybe you won't even believe this, but this, I'm afraid,I heard with my own ears: ""Tatyana, just how long can you fight for somethingthat you know will never have any effect? You're alone against everyone, so instead why don't you give more money to the chief conductor, and everything will go fine for you."" I started to cry, turned, and left. What else could I do, where else could I go to complain? I realized that everything was useless.And the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to seeit. I filed a written complaint, and they ground it into dust, they destroyed it, I still have a copy, but what's the use? When the General Procuracy got involved with the investigation of the bloody Sumgait affair, in addition to the information about what I saw, what I was a witness to, I gave testimony about the mafia at the railroad. They accepted my petition, but I don't know if they're going to pursue it or not. Because, you'll excuse me, I no longer believe in the things I aspired to, the things I believed in before: It's all dead. They just spit on my soul, stomped on everything, physically, and most important, spiritually, because you can lose belongings, that's nonsense, thatall comes with time, but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in you--your beliefs--are destroyed, it can be very difficult to restore them...I want to tell of one incident. I just don't know, at the time I was in such astate that I didn't even take minor things into account. Here is an example.Of course, it's not a minor one. My neighbor, Raisa Sevastyanova, she has ason, Valery, who is in the 9th grade in a school in Microdistrict 8. A boy,Vitaly [Danielian], I don't know his last name, goes to school with him, orrather, went to school with him. I was just sitting in an apartment trying tomake a phone call to Moscow . . . Oh yes, and there's one important detail:When the massacre began, for two to three hours the phones weren't working in Armenian apartments, and later, in several Russian and Azerbaijani apartments.But the fact of the matter is that service was shut off, you could not call anywhere. Why? Again, it means it was all planned. How come service is cut offfor no reason? And the lights went off. And those brats were raging as theyliked They weren't afraid, they ran about freely, they that no one would slap their hands and no one would dare to stop them.  They knew it.Now I'm going to tell about the incident. So this little Vitaly, Vitalik, anArmenian boy, went to school with Valery; they were in the same class. According to what Valery and his neighbor pal said--at the time I was in thesame apartment as they were, I sat at the phone waiting for the call to be putthrough--a mob attacked the building where Vitalik lived. So Valery ran tohis mother and said, ""Mamma, please let me go to Vitalik's, what if they killhim? Maybe he's still alive, maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow.. . . He's a nice guy, we all like him, he's a good person, he's smart."" His mother wouldn't let him go. In tears, she says, ""Valery, you can't go because I am afraid."" He says, ""Mamma, we can get around the crowd. We'll just watch, just have a look."" They made it through. I don't know, I think Vitalik'sparents lived in Microdistrict No. 1, and when they got there, they made a superficial deduction. Knowing that balconies and doors were being broken everywhere, that you could see from the street which were the Armenian apartments in the building, they went here and there and looked, and saw that the windows were intact, and so they calmed down. But even though the windows in that apartment were not broken, everything inside was totally smashed, and Vitalik lay there with a broken skull, and his mother and father had already been murdered. Little Vitalik didn't even know they were dead. So two weeks ago, I don't know, he was in critical condition, no, maybe it was longer: we left Sumgait on March 20, spent some time in Moscow, and then we came to Yerevan. So it's been about a month already; it's so hard to keep all this straight. So Valery, the next day, when he found out that Vitalik's family hasbeen killed and Vitalik was ling in the Semashko Hospital in Baku, Valery andhis classmates got together and went to visit him. But they wouldn't admit them, telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in a coma. They cried and left, having also found out that the girl I saw being kicked and dragged was in that hospital too. As it turns out she was brought there in serious condition, but at least she was alive at the time . . .When we got to the SK club we would see first one friend and then another, throw ourselves into their arms and kiss them, because you had wondered if these friends were alive or not, if those friends were alive or not  . . . Andwhen you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived! Whenyou saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end.If you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book. A book of things it is even difficult to believe. And those two girls who were raped were entirely black and blue, the ones at the SK, they know I'm not lying, that girlfriend came up to one of them and said, ""What happened?"" and she bared her breasts, and they were completely covered in cigarette burns . . . those rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts. After something like that I don't know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it.Now . . . When we stayed at the military unit for a while, they provided,well, basic conditions for us there. The military unit is located in Nasosny,some six miles from Sumgait. And living there we met with a larger groupof people. There were about 1,600 people at the unit. You know, there was apoint when I couldn't even go outside because if you went outside you sawso much heartbreak around you. And when you hear the false rumors . . .Yes, by the way, false rumors were spread in Sumgait saying that the Armeniansaround Yerevan had destroyed Azerbaijani villages and razed them to the groundwith bulldozers. I didn't know whether to believe it or not. And people who don't know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge. But when I arrived in Armenia and was in Spitak, and in Spitak all those villages are not only intact, but at that time had even been protected just in case, they were guarded, they got better food than did the inhabitants of Spitak. Not a single person there died, and no one is planning to harm them. Around Yerevan all the villages are safe and unharmed, and the Armenians didn't attack anyone. But actually, after an evil of the magnitude suffered in Sumgait therecould have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. And I don'tknow why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are guilty, that it is they who organized it. Rumors like that are being spread inAzerbaijan. And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, they notonly perceive it with their minds, but with their hearts, too. To them it seems that the older person is telling the truth. For example, one says; ""Did you know that out of 31 people killed (by the way, originally they said 31 people, but later they found a 32nd), 30 were Azerbaijani and one was an Armenian?""Of course I'm upset, but it's utterly impossible to discuss such things andnot become upset. Sometimes l forget things, but I know I want to return tothe time when we were in the SK club across from the City Party Committee.When I saw Muslimzade in the SK club building I went to him to ask because I couldn't believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner. I alreadymentioned this, and if I repeat anything, please excuse me. I asked him, ""Why did you do that and why are you here now, why did you come here? To laugh at these women who are strewn about on the floor?"" The overcrowding there was tremendous, it was completely unsanitary, and several of the children werealready sick. It's true the troops tried to make it livable for us. They cooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food, but the thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at it everywhere, that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere. Plus they were never given any direct orders, they didn't know what they were authorizedto do and not to do. And it was only on March 8 at five o'clock in the eveningthat Krayev himself, the Lieutenant General, the City Commandant of Sumgait, was given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored personnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do, as his heart advised him, and relocate people to the military unit.But that's not what I want to talk about now. Muslimzade, characteristically, tried to get me out of the SK building and take me to the City PartyCommittee, which is across the square from the club. He took me by thehand and said, ""Citizen, don't worry, we'll go and have a talk in my office.I told him, ""No, after everything you've done, I don't believe one iota of what you say. If I go to the City Party Committee I'll disappear, and the traces of me will disappear too. Because you can't stand it when . . . "" Oh yes, and there was another interesting detail from that meeting. It was even very funny, although at the time I wasn't up to laughing. He was in a nice, expensive hat, and so as to put him to shame, so to speak, I said, ""Oh, why did you come here all duded up like a London dandy, you smell of good perfume,you're in your starched shirt, and you have your expensive hat on. You cameto ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor, who arealready getting sick, whose relatives have died. Did you come to laugh atthem?"" And the one who was accompanying him, an Azerbaijani, I don't know who he was or what his title was, he quickly snatched the hat off Muslimzade's head and hid it. Then I said, ""My God! We're not marauders. We're not you! We didn't come to you with the intention of stealing!"" ""Well kill me, kill me!"" Muslimzade says to me, ""But I'm not guilty . . . kill me, kill me, but I'm notguilty."" And I say, ""OK, fine, you're not guilty, have it your way. But give us an answer, we're asking you: Where were you when they were torturing and raping those poor women, when they were killing the children, burning things, carrying on outrageously, and wrecking all those apartments? Where were you then?"" ""You know, we didn't expect it, we did not know what to do, we didn't anticipate that something like that would happen in Sumgait."" I started laughing and said, ""It's truly funny."" He says, ""What could I do? We didn't know what to do."" And I say, ""I'm sorry, but it'll be ridiculous if I tell you: The First Secretary of the City Party Committee shouldn't march out in front with a banner; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross over his dead body. That's what you should have done. That's the way it was during the war. Not a single party committee secretary compromised himself;either he died or he led people into battle. And what did you do? You ran away, you left, you hid, you marched with a flag, because you were afraid, excuse my language, you feared for your own damned hide. And when we ask you, you tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done? That's right,"" I told him, ""the City party committee got confused, all the party committees got confused, the police got confused,. Baku got confused, they all lay in a faint for two weeks, and the gang ran the show with impunity. And if it weren't for the troops it wouldn't have been just two days, there wouldn't be a single Armenian left in Sumgait for sure, they would have finished their bloody affair, because they brazenly went up to some Russians, too, the ones who tried to say something to them, and they told them, 'As soon as we finish with the Armenians we'll come after you, too.""And by the way, there was a colonel, who took us to the military unit. He wasthe one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours laterarrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the  SK and took us tothe military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit. We asked him, ""What? How? What will come of us?"" He openly said, ""You know, for us the main thing now is to catch that gang. We'll finish that quickly. You'llstay at the military unit for the time being, and we'll decide later."" The General Procuracy of the USSR arrived, it consists of investigators from all cities. There were some from Stavropol, from everywhere, just everywhere, because the affair was truly frightful. About this, by the way, Comrade Katusev spoke;as everyone knows, he's the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR. When he gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit, by the way, he told us the honest truth, because he couldn't not say it, because he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen, and he said, ""There was Afghanistan; and it was bad, but Sumgait--it'shorrible! And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely punished, in accordance with our laws."" And that's a quote. Then one mother throws herself at him--her two sons had died before her very eyes--and says,""Who will return my sons? Who is going to punish the [culprits]?"" They tried to calm her down, and he said, ""In order for us to conduct a proper investigation, in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility, you must help us, because we don't know, maybe there was someone else in the gang who is now being concealed in homes, and maybe the neighbors know, maybe someone saw something. Don't be afraid, write about it in detail. So that you're not afraid . . . Everyone knows that many of you are afraid, having lived through such horrors, they think that if they write the whole truth about, let's say, their neighbor or someone else, that they will seek revenge later. We're going to do it like this: We're going to set up an urn and you can throw what you write in there. We don't need to know who wrote it. The names of the people who write won't be made public, but we need all theinformation. Let each and every one not be afraid, let each write what is necessary, who they saw in that gang, who made threats or shouted threatening gibes about the Armenians . . . You must describe all of these people and put the information into the urn.""Two soldiers and a major guarded the urn. And, sure enough, many people, people who didn't even want to write . . .I know one woman who asked me, she came up and said, ""You, as a Russian, the same thing won't happen to you as will happen to me. So please . . . I'll give you the information, and you please write it down for me."" So she was afraid, and there were a lot likeher . . . But later, after Katusev made his speech, she sat and wrote downeverything she knew. And we threw it all into the urn. Now we don't know if it will be of any use. For a factual picture will emerge from all that information. One person can lie, but thousands can't lie, thousands simply can't lie. You have to agree with that, a fact is a fact. Why, for example, should someone say that black is white if it is really black?   The First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the AzerbaijaniSSR, Mamedov, as I said, was in Yerevan. My husband and I were at the Council of Ministers of the Armenian SSR and found out that Mamedov was present, the one who had come to convince the people of Sumgait to  return to their previous dwellings, to their old apartments. We asked for a meeting with him, and it was granted. When we went to see him he tried to behave properly, very politely, delicately, but . . . when the truth was told right to his face and when I asked him some of the same questions I had asked Muslimzade, ""Where wereyou personally when they were beating us? Now you're trying to convince us to return, why didn't you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where it was all leading?"" he says, ""You're telling the truth. Let's not mince words. You've told me right to my face, and I'll tell you straight. I'll tell you the pure truth. I was gotten out of bed in the evening, the whole government was up, including me, and we were restraining a crowd of about 45,000 in Baku. But we never expected that in a city like Sumgait, with its fine international record, such a thing could happen. We expected it in Baku.""I say, ""So that means you expected it all the same? Why were you expecting it?"" And he says, ""You know, it just happened that way. We were expecting it in Baku, we were trying to restrain it, but in Sumgait . . . "" I say, ""Fine, you didn't know for the first three or four hours, but then you should have known. Why did no one help us?"" And he says, ""Well, OK, we didn't know what todo"" and things like that. Basically it was the same story I got from Muslimzade. Later, when he said, ""You go on back, the situation in Sumgait is favorable now, everything is fine, the Armenians are friendly with the Azerbaijanis . . . "" To this l answered, ""You know what . . . I'm speaking with you as a [member of a] neutral nation . . . I have never argued with Armenians or with Azerbaijanis and I was an eyewitness . . . You tell me, please, Comrade Mamedov, "" I asked him, ""What would you say about thishonestly, if you were being completely frank with us?"" Then he said, ""Yes, I admit that I am honestly ashamed, shame on the entire Azerbaijani nation, we have disgraced ourselves not only before the entire Soviet Union, but before the whole world. Because now the Voice of America and all the other foreign radio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors, too.""And I say, ""There's nothing to add to what really happened. I don't think it'spossible to add anything more awful."" He says, ""Yes, I agree with you, I understand your pain, it is truly an unfortunate occurrence."" I repeat that hesaid ""unfortunate occurrence."" And then he suddenly remembered himself, what he was saying--he had a pen in his hands, he was fidgeting with it nervously--and said, ""Oh, excuse me, a tragedy, really . . . "" I take this to mean that he really thinks it's an ""unfortunate occurrence."" ""And of course,"" he says, ""I understand that having gone through all this you can't return to Sumgait, but it's necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being tried."" And he even gave a detail, which, I don't know if it matters or not, that 160 policemen were being tried. Specifically in relation to that bloody affair.Yes, by the way, there is another good detail, how I was set up at work inBaku after the events. I went to an undergarment plant, there was an Azerbaijani working there, and suddenly she tells me, ""What, they didn'tnail your husband? They screwed up."" I was floored, I hadn't imagined thatanyone in Baku, too, could say something like that. Well after that I went upto see . . . to my office, I needed to find out about those days, what wasgoing to happen with them, how they were going to put down those days from February 29 to March 10 . . . and the administrator told me, ""I don't know, Tatyana, go to the head of the conductors' pool. Be grateful if they don't put it down as unexcused absence."" I was really discouraged by this. They all know that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived, and here they're telling me that I was skipping work, as though I was off enjoying myself somewhere. I went to the office of the chief of the pool, his last nameis Rasulov, and he's had that position for many years. Incidentally, he's a Party member, and is a big man in town. And suddenly, when I went to him and said, ""Comrade Rasulov, this is the way it was . . . "" He looked at me askanceand said, ""And why are you""--he knows me by my previous last name--""why didyou get wrapped up in this mess?"" I say, ""What do you mean, why did I get wrapped up in this mess? My husband's an Armenian,"" I tell him, ""I have an Armenian last name."" And he screwed up his face, made a kind of a grimace, as though he had eaten something sour, and said, ""I didn't expect that you would. . . "" What did he mean by that? And ""how"" should he behave, the chief of thepool, a man who supervises 1,700 workers? Now, it's true, there was a reduction, but for sure there are still 1,200 conductors working for him. And if someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that, then what can you expect from a simple, uneducated, politically unsophisticated person?!He's going to believe any and all rumors, that the Armenians are like this, the Armenians are like that, and so on . . .By the way, that Mamedov--now I'm going back to Mamedov's office when I asked him ""Are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return to Sumgait?"" he answered, ""Yes, you know, I would guarantee them . . . I don'twant to take on too much, I would guarantee them firmly for 50 years. But I won't guarantee them for longer than 50 years."" I say, ""So you've got anotherthing like that planned for 50 years from  now? So they'll be quiet and then in another 50 years it'll happen again?!"" I couldn't contain myself any more,and I also told him, ""And how did it get to that point, certainly you knewabout it, how they were treating the Russians, for example, in Baku and in Sumgait, how they were hounded from their jobs? Certainly you receivedcomplaints, I wrote some myself. Why did no one respond to them? Why did everyone ignore what was going on? Didn't you prepare people for this by the way you treated them?"" And he says, ""You know, you're finally starting to insult me!"" He threw his pen on the desk. ""Maybe now you'll say I'm a scoundrel too?"" I say, ""You know, I'm not talking about you because I don't know. But about the ones who I do know I can say with conviction, yes, that comrade was involved in this, that, and that, because I know for certain.""Well anyway he assured us that here, in Yerevan, there were false rumors, that 3,000 Sumgait Armenians were here, and 15,000 were in Sumgait and had gotten back to work. Everyone was working, he said, and life was very good. ""We drove about the town ourselves, Comrade Arutiunian [First Secretary of the Communist Party of Armenia SSR] came from the Council of Ministers of Armenian, he came and brought information showing that everything was fine inSumgait."" When I asked Mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said, '""Well, I walked down the street."" And I said, ""Walking down the street in any city, even if I were to go to New York, I would never understand the situationbecause I would be a guest, I don't have any contact with people, but if you spend 10 days among some blue-collar workers in such a way that they didn't know you were the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, you'd hear something quite different."" I told him, for example, that I drew my conclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments. They tookus all in turns to pick things up, since people had fled to the military unit;they got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible. How are the neighbors in the microdistrict, how will they view us, what do they think? I thought maybe that in fact it wasn't something general, of a mass nature, someanti-national something. And when that bus took us to our building, because itwas the same bus, while we were going up to our apartment, an armed soldier accompanied us. What does that say? It speaks of the fact that if everything there were fine, why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back withus, going from apartment to apartment? And in fact, especially with the young people, you could sense the delight at our misfortune, the grins, and they were making comments, too. And that was in the presence of troops, when policedetachments were in the microdistricts and armored personnel carriers and tanks were passing by. And if people are taking such malicious delight when the situation is like that, then what is it going to be like when they withdraw protection from the city altogether? There will be more outrages, of course, perhaps not organized, but in the alleys . . .

"Do you count yourself as one who is weak in the faith?Is there any doubt in your mind about what is right and what is missingthe mark?Are they clear or do you have doubts?An important first step; the realization that Paul was human.Yes, and he was writing and speaking for an audience that was at best,very weak in the faith; most could not read, most were unfamiliar withthe Hebrew Scriptures in even the Septuagint form. Paul adapted themessage of the Bible to a largely uneducated market. Granted, thismarket still exists today, but do you count yourself as part of it? Tobe ""weak in the faith"" is not missing the mark (hamartia) if you do thebest that your education allows. Are you doing the best?Let me make clear that the ""Law"" is none other than the Pentateuch ofGenesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. What did Jesus sayabout the ""Law"" in Matt5:14-19? Where did Jesus say that the ""Law"" onlyapplies to Jews and that Gentiles are above the ""Law""?Who acknowledged this fact? On what basis? Are we extra-biblical at thispoint? Why not also acknowledge that the Bhagavad-Gita is the onlyrelevant text for Gentiles, after all we see in the Bible that it wasMagus from the east who observed the star-signs of Jesus? Why botherwith any texts at all? Why not just follow whatever the Church has tosay?I don't see how you can say this with a straight face. Are you afollower of Christ, or do you follow someone else? Are you saying thatthe words of Jesus only apply to Jews?How Jewish was Paul after he changed his name from Saul?Who says Gentile Christians are not covered by the first five books? Whosays that Gentile Christians are above the Ten Commandments?You're implying that Jesus' words are valid only for Jews. Is thisreally what you mean to say? You do realize that you are gutting ratherlarge portions of the Bible? When you read Jesus' words, did you everconsider that maybe, just maybe Jesus is talking to you, no matter whatyour race or sex? If the Hebrew Scriptures and the Gospel accounts ofJesus are only directed to Jews, why were they translated into English?As Paul would call him, one who was weak in the faith.Which is more important: 1) The recorded word of Jesus or 2) Indicationsthat you can deduce from the Bible? Was Jesus God only of the Jews, orGod of all humankind of all race and sex?This is your understanding of Paul. Compare this to the word of Jesus.Are you Christian or Pauline?Again, this is your understanding of Paul. Did Jesus say that the Lawwas an ""impossible standard?"" Did Jesus say that He superceded the Law?Are you Christian or Pauline?You acknowledge that it is *your* reading of Paul. What did Jesus say?Can you deny that Matt5:14-19 is quite clear in its meaning? Are you Christian or Pauline?When did Jesus say that the purpose of the Law was conviction of sin?Please reread Matt5:14-19. Are you Christian or Pauline?Are you saying that the Ten Commandments are ceremonial details?You call observance of the Sabbath, the day on which the Lord rested,ceremonial? Has circumcision been superceded for Christians?....Are you Christian or Pauline?[Both.  There is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what isnot, at least not in this case.  Jesus did not deal explicitly withthe question of whether the Law was binding on Gentiles.  That's why Ihave to cite evidence such as the way Jesus dealt with the Centurion.As to general Jewish views on this, I am dependent largely on studiesof Pauline theology, one by H.J. Schoeps, and one whose author I can'tcome up with at the moment.  Both authors are Jews.  Also, variousChristian and non-Christian Jews have discussed the issue here and inother newsgroups.Mat 5:19 is clear that the Law is still valid.  It does not say thatit applies to Gentiles.And yes, I say that the specific requirement for worship on theSabbath in the Ten Commandments is a ceremonial detail, when you'relooking at the obligations of Gentiles.  Similarly circumcision.I'm not sure quite what else I can say on this subject.  Again, it'sunfortunate the Jesus didn't answer the question directly.  However wedo know (1) what the 1st Cent. Jewish approach was, (2) how Jesusdealt with at least one Gentile, and (3) how Jesus' disciples dealtwith the issue when it became more acute (I'm referring to Acts 15more than Paul).  Given that these are all in agreement, I don't seethat there's a big problem.",7

"GREAT post Martin.  Very informative, well-balanced, and humanitarianwithout neglecting the need for scientific rigor.(Cross-posted to alt.psychology.personality since some personality typingwill be discussed at the beginning - Note: I've set all followups to sci.medsince most of my comments are more sci.med oriented and I'm sure most of thereplies, if any, will be med-related.)They are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS).Oops, that is not a recognized ""illness"" in the psychological community,better not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)Actually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicianswill type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system,just e-mail me and I'll send a summary file to you).  In the generalpopulation, NT's comprise only about 12% of the population, but amongphysicians it is much much higher (I don't know the exact percentage -any help here a.p.p.er's?)One driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obviouscholeric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need tocontrol, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they arealso extroverted, they are best described as ""Field Marshalls"".  This traitis very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want tolead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge,to raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science andtechnology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically-minded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other typesand temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However,when the NT person has self-image challenges, the ""dark-side"" of thispersonality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.A physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper theirtemperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling),and is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patientmust be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I'veknown many M.D.'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don't oblige themwith a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and theyusually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is anextreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).Maybe we need more NF doctor's.  :^)Enough on this subject - let's move on to candida bloom.You've helped me already by your post.  Of course, I believe that I havebeen misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis', but beingthe phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few peoplemyself in past posts.  Let's all try to raise the level of this discussionabove the level of anal effluent.In my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immunestressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuseswere a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged.I also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeksof Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterialinfection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won't get into thedetails), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT's made thisdiagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of thedifficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showeda bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help youunderstand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungaltherapy below).The first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poormucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without beingconsidered 'systemic' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetweeninfection.I was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, aftermy blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, thendropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also receivedzinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairlycomplex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomolecularspecialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal,he then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin)supplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene.Call me carrot face.  :^)Hopefully, Elaine's doctor will take a similar, careful approach and toall supplements.  I'm even reevaluating some supplements I'm taking, forexample, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer hadgood information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-orderimprovement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably isnot worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.Though I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, thatI definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in mysinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies thatdemonstrate candida ""blooms"" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation(sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after oneweek of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during thistime - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting onSporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considerednormal).BTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can'tremember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950'swhich stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious)aspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinusinflammation symptoms.  I'll have to dig out that reference again since itis relevant to this discussion.My doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergicresponse to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive.Another question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this testis essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can growpart-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a threshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy toCandida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membraneirritation due to the body's allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post,one does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a Ph.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.BTW, and I'll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, ""Sinus Survival"",has routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemicanti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronicsinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times inthe last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but itdoesn't cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infectionis not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He's also found thatnystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.This implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom isaggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partwayinto the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than bydirect contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit,lots of 'ifs', and 'implies', which doesn't please the hard-core NT whohas to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue, but one has to startwith some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.This brings up an interesting observation used by those who will denyand reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until theappropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can't observe or culturethe yeast ""bloom"" in the gut or sinus, then there's no way to diagnose oreven recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtuallyimpossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannotbe easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.It's a real Catch-22.Another Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say thatno studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it's notup to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study whichshould not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies shouldbe done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order toconvince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets,you literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence tocompete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact studyneeded funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even getfunding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I'm very aware of this for thesmaller funded projects).  I'm afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 otherdoctors got together, pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotesinto a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would getnowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.It is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have*decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading tonoticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenablehypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidenceto the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they wouldalso oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue - excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, willnot, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who holdsuch a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...Aren't there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of thesinus mucus membranes and cilia?Again, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungusspecies can grow hyphae (""roots"") into deep tissue, similar to mold growingin bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, butyou can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemicanti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones suchas Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as hasbeen pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I've been ine-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long-term treatment of GI tract ""candidiasis"".  It's like trying to weed a gardenby cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to comeout again once you walk away.The $60000 question is whether a contained candida ""bloom"" can partiallygrow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptomsin susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming ""systemic"" in theclassical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessivebloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection thatis potentially lethal.Also, if one is an 'anal retentive', like I've been diagnosed in a priorpost, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)As I've said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical systemthat make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attemptalternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don't work.For example, I went to three ENT's, who all said that I will just have to livewith my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed (they did mentionsurgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren't plugged and it would notget to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive andfairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring andequalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastlyimproved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated.Of course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would haveimproved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of theexperience of the three ENT's I saw who said that I'd just have to ""live withit"".  I'm confident I will reach what one could call a total ""cure"".  Theanti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that directionbecause of my overuse of ab's for the last four years.  (Note:  for thosehaving sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above.Be sure to get the revised edition.)Dr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and hisvisits to several ENT's totally floored him when they said ""you'll just haveto live with it"".  He spent several years trying everything - standard andnon-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He nowshares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the roadto recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take asystemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history ofanti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his ownpractice.  I'm sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti-""yeast hypothesis"" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as,""it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases"", to put it mildly.I also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violatingtheir moral obligations to help the patient.Maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and areconfronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the ""hypotheticalyeast overgrowth"" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast peoplehave identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenueshave been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things -you cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor doessomething non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over athousand of his patients, shouldn't you at least sit up and take notice?Maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it worksinstead of why it shouldn't work.  I'm afraid a lot of doctors have becomeso enamored with ""scientific correctness"" that they are ignoring the patientsthey have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, whichwe don't see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point whenyou just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach(such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after havingexhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditionalmedical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  Iwent to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishment,and as a result I have found significant relief.Would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set upsome kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or havinghis license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt)therapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all theaccepted therapies are ineffective?  I'd like to hear a doctor tell me:""well, I've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in thiscountry, and since they clearly don't work for you, I now have the authorityto use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  Ican't promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to signsomething saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature ofthese unproven therapies, and I'll have to register your case at the StateBoard.""  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would've jumped on thispronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruisticreasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with muchrisk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to thepatient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine,and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also wouldbe morally and ethically better than the current system by showing thecompassion of the medical community to the patient - that it's doing everythingit can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanismthat is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some ofwhich seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all(true quackery).I better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size.What dosage of B6 appears to be necessary to promote the healing and properworking of the mucos memebranes?I'd like to see the role of complex carbohydrates, such as starch.Brave soul you are.

"On the one hand there are advantages to having the liturgy stay the same.  John has described some of these.  On the other hand, some people seem to start tuning out `the same old words' and pay attention better when things get changed around.  I think innovative priests and liturgy committees are trying to get our attention and make things more meaningful for us.  It drives me crazy too. Different people have differing preferences and needs in liturgy.  My local parish is innovative.  I prefer to go to Mass at the next parish over.  Sometimes we don't have the option of attending a Mass in the style which best suits us.  John put a smiley on it but to ""just offer it up"" probably is the solution.A related issue, that it sounds like John does not have to deal with, is that spouses may have different liturgical tastes.  My husband does like innovative litury.  It is a challenge to meet both of our spiritual needs without just going our separate ways.  When you include the factor of also trying to satisfy our children's needs, things get pretty complicated.One thing to remember is that even the most uncongenial Mass is still Mass.",7

In many cases, there was no way to get any sort of a tray underthe oil pan because it was boxed in by the bottom of the hull and variousfloation chambers on each side.  And if you *did* get something there, you'dspill all the oil out of it for sure trying to get it back out again.So we used a small pump powered by an electric drill to suck the oil outthe dipstick hole.

Maybe I'm still not understanding it,or maybe I'm just understanding it all too well.From the bottom of my heart I know that the punishment of an innocentman is wrong.  I've tried repeatedly over the course of several yearsto accept it, but I just can't.  If this means that I can't accept thepremise that a god who would allow this is 'perfectly good', then sobe it.If you can explain to me why the death of Jesus was a *good* thing,then I would be very glad to hear it, and you might even convert me.Be warned, however, that I've heard all the most common argumentsbefore, and they just don't convince me.",11

"Your statement is a common misconception, but it just isn't true. In theGerman Weimar system, the Chancellor was not necessarily the leader of thelargest Reichstag party; the Chancellor was appointed by the President andgenerally was the leader of a coalition of parties who could form an effectivemajority in the Reichstag. Beyond that, the implication that Hitler rose tothe Chancellorship because a majority of Germans wanted Nazi rule is falseas well. Before President Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor in January1933, the German people did not show a particular desire to be led either byHitler or by the Nazi party. These are the results of the March 1932 electionfor President, the closest Hitler ever came to direct election: Hindenburg49.6%, Hitler 30.1%, Thaelmann 13.2%, Duesterberg 6.8%. In the runoff electionin April the results were: Hindenburg 53%, Hitler 36.8%, Thaelmann 10.2%.So we can see that Hitler personally was supported by only about a third ofGerman voters.Similarly, the Nazi party never received more than 37% of the vote inReichstag elections. That occurred in July 1932. In the November 1932 electionthe Nazis *lost* two million votes and 34 seats, down from 230 to 196 out ofthe 608 in the Reichstag. Comparitively, the Socialists had 121 and theCommunists 100. The Communists had gained 11 seats, and the German Nationalparty, which had supported the previous government, had picked up a millionof the Nazis' lost votes to gain 15 seats (up to 52). I think the other largeparty was the Catholic Center party (I don't know how many seats they had butI think they were declining), and there were numerous other small parties.Thus the Nazi vote was on the decline at the time Hitler was appointedChancellor.What brought Hitler to power was *not* the demand of the German people forHitler or the Nazis to run things, but the inability of the other parties toput their differences behind them in favor of forming an effective governmentfor the country. Germany did not have an enduring democratic tradition, andtheir parliamentary system lacked effective center parties that favored theinterests of the majority of the population. Instead what they had was anumber of small parties who were unable to put aside their own specificobjectives in order to combine against the Nazis, who were out to end thedemocratic process. In fact, part of the problem was that some of the otherparties with substantial representation, like the Communists, were alsoout to end the democratic process, but with different results in mind, andgenerally didn't mind seeing parliamentary democracy go under.Germany had already had a non-Nazi Chancellor with a majority coalitionfor five months while the Nazis had been the largest Reichstag party, andthere certainly was no danger of a revolution in favor of the Nazis.If anything the Nazis were starting to get desperate because they had failedto get enough support to make Hitler President and their popular vote hadbegun to decline.Hitler was not Hindenburg's first choice to be Chancellor, not even hissecond choice. First, von Papen had been Chancellor since June 1932. Afterthe November election when the Nazis *lost* seats, Hindenburg first prevailedon von Papen to remain as Chancellor. But there were intrigues behind his backand support for him was lacking. So then Hindenburg turned to von Schleicher,who became Chancellor for two months. Eventually he too was unable to holdtogether a working coalition of parties to oppose the Nazis, who refused toparticipate in any government that was not led by a Nazi Chancellor. Some ofthe Nazi leadership, particularly Gregor Strasser who was the #2 man in theparty at the time, wanted to participate in a coalition government. But others,knowing the party's support was waning, figured that their best hope to gainpower lay in undermining the democratic process. Nevertheless, the countrywas governed for seven months by Chancellors who were not Nazis, even thoughthe Nazis were the largest Reichstag party. The failure of these men toachieve a working coalition was due to the inability of their coalitionparties to work together.Here's how William Shirer puts it in _The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich_:   The cardinal error of the Germans who opposed Nazism was their   failure to unite against it. At the crest of their popular strength,   in July 1932, the National Socialists had attained but 37 percent of   the vote. But the 63 percent of the German people who expressed their   opposition to Hitler were much too divided and shortsighted to combine   against a common danger which they must have known would overwhelm   them unless they united, however temporarily, to stamp it out.True, the German people supported Hitler after he became Chancellor. Butthat doesn't change the fact that there was not overwhelming support for him*before* he was in power. The German people were not crying out for Hitler totake over, no matter how bad economic conditions were. The leftist parties(Socialists/Communists) probably had more support in total than the Nazis.Hitler used the fact that others were passively or actively willing to seethe government paralyzed as a means to taking it over.",10

"While I agree with you on that formal training is essential for safe riding,I disagree strongly with your original point. The point of formal training must be to prepare riders for the road. Preparedness is in my opinionto know as much as possible. So, to exclude some aspects of riding a bike in a course is wrong IMHO. Now to countersteering in particular.Countersteering is something that must be trained. A common reaction among new bikers (or bicycle riders) in an emergency situation, is to steer the motorcycle like a bicycle. As we know this makes the motorcycle go in thedirection opposite to what was intended. Needless to say, this is dangerous.I have a specific example: A rider in a left turn. The rider thinks he/sheis to close to the right shoulder of the road, and tries to steer the motorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right handle. The motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road. A worse scenario: The same rider, same turn. In the middle of the turnthe rider sees a truck coming towards him/her. The panicking rider triesto steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it.The main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency situations, AND what to do if in one. Thus, the knowledge (and training) ofcountersteering is IMHO a must in any riding course.",18

"After watching the Pengiuns all year (and as many other teams aspossible), I've really noticed an increase in Tom Barasso's cheap shotsthis year (and not noticed a corrsponding increase with othergoaltenders).

Justas examples last night, I noticed him elbowing Scott Stevens in thehead, which basically started the whole shoving match that got Stevens(Scott) and Tocchet 2 minute minors. He also KICKED John McLean. Ofcourse he wasn't called for that. Isn't kicking an automatic matchpenalty and 10 game suspension?

"I've been a Giants season ticket holder for years and never really complainedabout the old ballyard place. Sure, it's been cold, the food lines were long,and the hired hands were surly, but this was all part of the Giants mystique.Or so I thought.I went to Tuesday's game (3 - 1 Giants over the Marlins) and the 'Stick was a much different place. Nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind, but everything is a lot better. The lines are a lot shorter, the bathrooms areCLEAN and have running water, and the hired hands were very polite. The new foghorn (lights up and blows after each homerun) and the wooden fenceare very nice, as are the new bleachers. The bleachers start right at the topof the fence and give a great view, and they've got beer stands at thebottome of the bleachers. The only complaint is that the electronic old-fashioned scoreboard looks electronic - could be better.These things should have been done a long time ago, but it took a real businessman (ex - Safeway President Peter Magowan) to figure it out.

"They are news because they are the exceptions. And the 'Islamic Holocaust'is much the topic of the day. The historical evidence proves that during the period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited, assisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people because of race, religion and national origin. Armenians perpetrated acts of sabotage, destroyed telephone cables, blew up bridges, blocked passes, set up ambushes, attacked security stations and small Turkish outposts behind the Ottoman Army lines on the one hand, and on the other ruthlessly attacked Turkish and Kurdish villages, slaughtering the Turkish population indiscriminately, women, children, old and young alike. Innocent Muslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death, or massacred with axes and swords, or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burntalive as can be seen below.Widespread Armenian massacres of innocent Muslims took place in regions of Van, Kars, Sivas, Erzurum, Bitlis, Erzincan, Mus, Diyarbakir and Maras. The Ottoman Army, while fighting to prevent the Russian invasion,also had to deal with Armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from behind. The Armenian genocide of the Muslims spread to all parts of Eastern Anatolia. Starting from late 1914, Armenians committed widespread massacres and genocide in Eastern Anatolia, because the arenawas left to the Armenians. Almost every Turkish town and village from Erzincan up to Azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide by Armenians and the Turkish genocide has been documented by Armenian, Russian, American, British, Ottoman, German, Austrian and French journalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this centurycommitted by the blood-thirsty Armenian genocide squads.The Ottoman Army, liberating Trabzon, Bayburt, Erzincan, Erzurum, Kars and other regions from the Russians, saw that the cities and their villages had been destroyed and burnt, people slaughtered, massacred.The massacres conducted by Armenians, which became a black stain forhumanity, shocked and disgusted even the Russian, British, German,Austrian, French and American authorities.Almost every Ottoman document is related to Armenian massacres and cruelties. The inhuman treatment, cruelties, atrocities, genocide by Armenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent Moslem Turkish and Kurdish people, are sufficiently reflected in historical documents. Even today over seventy-five years later, the terrifying screams of the victims of these cruelties can be heard.Source: Documents: Volume I (1919).

Although two months have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of Armenian gangs, I have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the Armenians at  almost every step. All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people  well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun. They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the  Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs.  I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is  destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air.

"Yeah, and it's also true most long complicated sequences of events,calculations, or big computer programs in general.  I don't arguethat you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals, Ijust question whether you >should<.The fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that wecan't model should be replaced with a random number generator.  Thathas been useful, for instance, in making data more palatable to humanperception or for torture testing the rest of the system, but I don'tthink it has much to do with fractals, and I certainly would ratherthat the model be improved in a more explicable manner.I guess I just haven't seen all these earth-shaking fractal modelsthat explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists.  Ireally hope I do, but I'm not holding my self-similar breath.Uh huh.  I'll believe it when I see it.  I've been chasing fractalcompression for a few years, and I still don't believe in it.  If it's sogreat, how come we don't see it competing with JPEG?  'Cause it can't,I'll wager.Actually, I have wagered, I quit trying to make fractal compressionwork- and I was trying- because I don't think it's a reasonablealternative to other techniques.  It is neat, though. :-)I'll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal.  That's why Idon't think fractal compression as it is widely explained ispractical.

"Tell me Tim, what are these guerillas doing wrong? Assuming that they are usingcivilians for cover, are they not killing SOLDIERS in THEIR country? If thebuffer zone is to prevent attacks on Israel, is it not working? Why is it further neccessary for Israeli guns to pound Lebanese villages? Why not justkill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone? You see, there is more tothe shelling of the villages.... it is called RETALIATION... ""GETTING BACK""...""GETTING EVEN"". It doesn't make sense to shell the villages. The leastit shows is a reckless disregard by the Israeli government for the lives ofcivilians.If Israel is not willing to accept the ""word"" of others then, IMHO, it hasno business wasting others' time coming to the peace talks. No, I am not Basil. I think Basil is a very intelligent person and Irespect what he writes. Basil is a person that I would gladly calla friend. He is, however, not me. Nor am I Lebanese, as some seem tosuspect. Tim, you are ignoring the fact that the Palestinians in Lebanon have beendisarmed. Hezbollah remains the only independent militia. Hezbollah doesnot attack Israel except at a few times such as when the IDF burned upSheikh Mosavi, his wife, and young son. Of course, if Israel would withdrawfrom Lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn'tmake the Lebanese so mad as to do that. Furthermore, with Hezbollah subsequently disarmed, it would not be possible.Tim, when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the Syrian border?Not lately, eh?Israel knows very well that the Syrians are able to restrain ALL who would useterritory under their control to attack Israel. While Lebanon would be betteroff with Syria and Israel out of its borders, the presence of Syrian troopsin Lebanon has meant a sharp decrease in attacks on Israeli territory (not onIsraeli troops in Lebanon, however. Please note the distinction) in thepast two years.I disagree, Basil has always seemed to me to be a cool-headed person, slowto anger (certainly more so than I). What is most important is that he is an actual witness to things from the other end of the Israeli guns. If only the Israeli government would remember what it was like when the roles were reversed perhaps they would moderate their ""retaliation"".",9

"CHECK MENAHEM BEGIN DAIRIES (published book) you'll find accounts of the   massacres there including Deir Yassen,   though with the numbers of massacred men, children and women are    greatly minimized.As per request of Hasan:From _The Revolt_, by Menachem Begin, Dell Publishing, NY, 1977:[pp. 225-227]    ""Apart from the military aspect, there is a moral aspect to thestory of Dir Yassin. At that village, whose name was publicizedthroughout the world, both sides suffered heavy casualties. We hadfour killed and nearly forty wounded. The number of casualties wasnearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers. The Arabtroops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy. The fightingwas thus very severe. Yet the hostile propaganda, disseminatedthroughout the world, deliberately ignored the fact that the civilianpopulation of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before thebattle began. One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationedat the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women,children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on theslopes of the hill.  By giving this humane warning our fighters threwaway the element of complete surprise, and thus increased their ownrisk in the ensuing battle. A substantial number of the inhabitantsobeyed the warning and they were unhurt. A few did not leave theirstone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. The fire of the enemywas murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquenttestimony. Our men were compelled to fight for every house; toovercome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. And thecivilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitablecasualties.    ""The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years ofrevolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. Wenever broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, inaccordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. I amconvinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a singleunnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle. But those who throwstones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin [1] would dowell not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2].    ""In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agencyfound it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah, whom Mr.Ben Gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called 'the wiseruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.' The 'wiseruler,' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung thebodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudalsuperciliousness. He rejected the apology and replied that the Jewswere all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of'dissidents.' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a waveof lying propaganda was let loose about 'Jewish attrocities.'    ""The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. In theresult it helped us. Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel.Kolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of theHaganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting.Beit-Iksa was also evacuated. These two places overlooked the mainroad; and their fall, together with the capture of Kastel by theHaganah, made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem. In therest of the country, too, the Arabs began to flee in terror, evenbefore they clashed with Jewish forces. Not what happened at DirYassin, but what was invented about Dir Yassin, helped to carve theway to our decisive victories on the battlefield. The legend of DirYassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and theconquest of Haifa.""[1] (A footnote from _The Revolt_, pp.226-7.) ""To counteract the lossof Dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, Arab headquarters atRamallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre byIrgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewishofficials, fearing the Irgun men as political rivals, seized upon thisArab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was inducedto reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth. Out ofevil, however, good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend ofterror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were seized with panic atthe mention of Irgun soldiers. The legend was worth half a dozenbattalions to the forces of Israel. The `Dir Yassin Massacre' lieis still propagated by Jew-haters all over the world.""",9

"[remainder of message deleted]Pardon me for replying to only a portion of your message :)The reason we can say ""God just exists"" and can't say ""The universe just exists"" is because the universe is a natural realm and is subject to natural laws in general and the law of cause and effect in particular.  That is, we observe in nature that every cause has an effect, and every effect was produced by a cause.  The existence of the natural realm, as an effect itself, cannot be its own cause; it must therefore have a supernatural cause.God, on the other hand, is a supernatural being, and is therefore not subject to such natural laws as the law of cause and effect.  As a supernatural being, God's eternal existence does not imply a previous cause the way the existence of a physical, natural cosmos does.  Thus, those who believe in the supernatural have a valid basis for accepting the existence of uncaused phenomena such as the eternal God, whereas those who deny the existence of the supernatural are faced with the dilemma of a physical universe whose very nature shows that it is not sufficient to explain its own existence.This is, of course, an oversimplification of a complex topic, but I just wanted to clarify some important differences between the supernatural (God) and the natural (the universe), since you seem to mistake them as being interchangeable.",7
"From: baba@Tymnet.com (Duane Hentrich)-BTW, I'm a WALC (white aryan lapsed catholic)-----d'baba Duane M. Hentrich        baba@Tymnet.Com-   I would like to go on record as objecting to Mr. Hentrich callinghimself an Aryan.  The word `Aryan' is of Sanskrit origin and occurs firstin the Hindu scripture, the Rigveda.  It seems to have been a tribal termbut may have had connotations of good character.  Such connotationsare quite explicit in the sayings of the Buddha who called his religion theeightfold Aryan path.   The word was borrowed by the German scholarMax Mueller who used it as a synonym for `indo-european', but then theNazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that `aryan' issynonymous with `nordic' which seems highly unlikely.  The people whooriginally called themselves aryas,  the Iranians, Noprth Indians, the Afghansand possibly the Kurds, are none of them nordic.  So the use of the wordby Westerners, though meant with apparent good humor in this case, isnontheless inappropriate.  The only Westerners who may have some claimto call themselves Aryans (by descent) are the Celts who seem to have wor-shipped a god called Aryaman who is mentioned in the Rigveda.  If you want to check what I am saying, look at  Mallory's book, ``Insearch of the Indo-Europeans"" or, just look at the Encyclopedia Britannica.The reason this usage is offensive is that most of Ancient Indian literatureas well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the Aryans andfor Westerners to butt in is really not nice, not to mention the horriblethings done by Germans to Jews, using a word to which the Germans haveno clear claim.",10

"Regarding the post for information about the Mac Portable and the Powerbook 100, here are a couple of the answers:(1) Does the Mac Portable support Appletalk? Yes(2) What CPU is in the Mac Portable? A low power version of the 68000 running at 15.87 Mhz.(3) Does the Mac Portable run system 7? Yes, although it does use up a lot of memory.(4) Is memory still availabe for the Portable? There are several vendors that still make RAM for the Portable. There are two options: Some vendors sell memory that plugs into the RAM Slot inside the portable. Others sell memory that plugs into the Processor Direct Slot. Either way, the most memory you can address is either 8 or 9 megabytes, depending on whether the Portable is Backlit or not. King Memory and Peripherials in Irvine California is the cheapest place I know of for Portable memory. 2MB - $140, 4 MB, $250, and 7 MB $415. I still see several ads in macuser that are selling 4 MB modules for $450. Wide variety in pricing here.(5) What is the internal HD? Its a Conner CP-3045 40 MB HD with an average access time of about 25 ms.(6) Is the screen better that the PB 100? Heavens yes! The PB 100 is a backlit PASSIVE matrix screen which means it fades out on you if you move your head a few degrees left or right. The Portable has a backlit or non-backlit ACTIVE Matrix screen which I think is a joy to read.Other things to consider - Where to get the portable and how much to pay for it? A good supplier has been SelectTerm in Mass. They were willing to sell a 2MB Non-backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about $650. Or a 4 MB Backlit Portable with an internal 2400 bps modem for about $900. The answer is call around for a good while or you'll pay too much.I'm still looking for an internal FAX modem for the portable? Anybody got one they want to sell? -- Good Luck, Gene Wright",14
"My brother has been alienated from my parents and me since shortly afterhis marriage to a domineering and insecure woman, about twelve years ago.We've kept things on a painfully polite, Christmas-card sort of levelfor most of this time. Attempts to see each other end disastrously, withhis wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imaginedslights to her, or his inattention or insensitivity to her (I mean, this'llhappen by the end of a single restaurant meal). He seems, from what I'veseen, to live in a state of quivering anxiety, hoping futilely to keepthe next storm from breaking. He has sacrificed not only meaningful contactwith us but also other friends and outside interests. Now, this is hischoice, and I need to accept it even if I deplore it. But it's hard.   From time to time I've wanted to drop the pretense that we have arelationship--by cutting off contact--or trying to have a real if painfulrelationship, by talking honestly with him, but I've always thought, ""Whybe dramatic? And you know he'll only get evasive and then find some excuseto get off the phone. Just leave the door open, in case he ever decides tocome back."" It's been an unsatisfying choice, to allow us to go onwith the superficial trappings of a relationship, but it was the best Icould think of.   Now, this weekend, my mother finally decided that she wasn't goingto pretend any more and has cut off relations with them. This was theoutcome of a phone conversation in which my sister-in-law screamed andraved at my mother, blaming her for everything wrong in their lives, andin which my brother evaded, temporized, claimed the situation wasbeyond his control, and as always expected my mother to make all theallowances and concessions. Mom said she would not, that she would notquietly take abuse any more, and that if these were the terms of theirrelationship, she didn't want to talk to or see them any more. And she hungup. (I have never seem my mother lose her temper, and I think that this isthe first time she's ever hung up on someone.) Mom says she feels as ifshe's divorced my brother, and that it's a relief in some ways to have thebreak out in the open and done with.     I have mixed feelings. I'm proud of Mom for sticking up for herself;angry at my brother and sister-in-law for hurting her, for being jerks, forpersisting in such a wretched life, which hurts us all and is warping theirchildren; angry at my sister-in-law for being so hateful, and angry at mybrother for being a coward and having so little respect for himself or usthat he's willing to throw us aside and use up all his energy trying toappease an unappeasable,emotionally disturbed woman; pained for their children, who are a mess;scared for the future, since this marks the time when either things willchange and improve or the break will become irrevocable; nastily self-righteous over this bit of proof that they can't ""get away"" with treatingus or each other this way, and then disgusted with myself for evenbeginning to gloat over others' misery; and finally, mostly, sad, sad,sad, to see my parents hurt and my brother and sister-in-law trapped ina horrible, destructive situation that they can't see a way out of--orthey can't bear to take whatever paths they do see. And I'm frustratedbecause I don't know what if anything to do, and doing nothing drives meup the wall. I try to pray, about my own feelings of rage, impotence,and vindictiveness, and about their situation, but I am notfree of the desire to *DO* something concrete. (The desire to *DO*something, to define a problem and fix it, is one of my besettingvices; I'm having a terrible time quieting down my internalmental chatter enough to listen for God.)  Do you thoughtful and kind people on the net have advice for me? Isthis a time to reach out to my brother? To let things be? How can Iconquer my rage AT him enough to be there FOR him? Here's the big question I've been evading throughout this long, longpost: Is it ok, as a Christian and a proponent of faith, hope, andcharity, to accept the destruction of a relationship? To give up onmy own brother, or at least to accept that I am powerless to help himand can only wait and see what happens? Do please answer--by e-mail orpost. Thank you.",7

"This is not the case: the ROM on the P9000 supports VESA modes of up to1024x768 in 256 colors.  VESA-compliant applications should have no troublesetting these modes. (But I'm forwarding your posting to our Software group,just in case.  Can't be too careful.)  Not that I doubt that YOUR applicationsare failing to run; lots of stuff depends on figuring out which exact SVGAthey're looking at, and don't use VESA calls (VESA is still pretty new).Every new chip set confuses them.I think we go to AT LEAST 76 Hz at 1024x768x8, and maybe more (andit's a function of the RAMDAC speed, not the Power 9000). We need tofix the problems you've noted (they were already on the list).  Ifyou're really interested, though, take a look at the text fileP9000RES.DAT, which holds the data from which the choices in theP9000 monitor installation program are built.  Working by analogy,you can build up a new monitor definition that has the rightcombinations of refresh rates for your monitors.  Keep a backup copyof the file!  Once you've built a new version of the P9000RES.DATfile, run the P9000 installation program, INST, and your new choicesshould show up.  (This assumes you have the WEITEK v. 2.2 drivers.You can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time ofthe driver: 02:20 is version 2.20.  Microsoft uses this gimmick,too.)The SPEEDY benchmark was put out by Hercules and IIT, who to myknowledge were unencumbered by any motivations except making theHercules Graphite/IIT AGX014 card look really good.  So I'd take thenumbers with a ton of salt. (Texas Instruments did the same thingwith WINTACH, trying to make the 34020 look good compared to the8514, as if anyone cared.)  It's safer (though not safe) to usebenchmarks from ""unbiased"" sources, such as testing labs, columnists,etc.I think you'll a large discrepancy between the results of SPEEDY andthe results of anything else in the universe on these things.Font caching is a perfectly legitimate optimization -- Windows hashooks for it built right into the GDI.  What's kind of silly is IIT'suse of a hardwired ""The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog thensat on a tack"" string in their driver.  Not only is it useless inreal applications, it lacks the programming elegance of the ""BartSimpson optimization,"" in which you save the bitmap of themost-recently drawn string in off-screen memory, and just do ascreen-to-screen bitblit if you happen to be given that same string asecond time in a row.  (We call it the ""Bart Simpson optimization""because Bart's the only person we can see benefiting from it: hecould right ""I will not cheat on benchmarks"" a hundred times and bedone in half the time it would take to actually form each character.)We don't have any lawyers -- they're all working for Intel.

"Would you say the same thing about the Dodgers in '65 or '66?  True,Cone is probably as good as Drysdale, and they have no Koufax, but still,these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals, withlots of low-scoring games, etc.  And they didn't use relievers, whereasJeff Montgomery is having a super season for them.     That being said, I still picked them 5th or so, but I think a superbpitching team can win if they have enough hitting.  There's more of achance of that, I think, than of a team with tremendous hitting but nopitching.  At least, to me.     I wonder, though - which one do you people think would do better - a teamwith Johnson, Koufax in his prime, Seaver, Carlton, and Young, in no realorder, as the starters, with Sutter, Fingers, and Lyle in the bullpen, butwith a puny offense (assuming good defense, like Mazeroski, Maranville, etc.)Or a team with poor pitching, but with an offense of Cobb, Carew, Ruth, Gehrig,Mays, Schmidt, Wagner, and Bench - again,you pick the order.     I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better byseasons' end.  Even the best hitters can succeed only 2/5 of the time intheir best years, but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts - taking allthe players in their prime, they might throw 50 shutouts in a year.  And allthe offense would have to do is get 1 run across.

Although some books demonstrate that the current implementation of Xthappens to call callback procedures in the order in which they are registered, the specification does not guarantee such a sequence, and supplemental authoritative documents (i.e. the Asente/Swick volume) do say that the order isundefined.  Because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget andthe application, Xt cannot guarantee the order of execution.	In general, the callback procedures should be thought of as operating independently of one another and should not depend on side-effects of othercallbacks operating; if a seqence is needed, then the single callback to be registered can explicitly call other functions necessary.[4/92; thanks to converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 122)  Why doesn't XtDestroyWidget() actually destroy the widget?	XtDestroyWidget() operates in two passes, in order to avoid leavingdangling data structures; the function-call marks the widget, which is not actually destroyed until your program returns to its event-loop. ----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 123)  How do I query the user synchronously using Xt?		It is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback,which has a clear flow of control. The calls to AskUser() block until answeris set to one of the valid values. If it is not a ""yes"" answer, the code dropsout of the callback and back to an event-processing loop: 	void quit(Widget w, XtPointer client, XtPointer call)	{		int             answer;		answer = AskUser(w, ""Really Quit?"");		if (RET_YES == answer)			{			answer = AskUser(w, ""Are You Really Positive?"");			if (RET_YES == answer)				exit(0);                }	}	A more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether to overwrite it.	This is accomplished by entering a second event-processing loop andwaiting until the user answers the question; the answer is returned to thecalling function. That function AskUser() looks something like this, where the Motif can be replaced with widget-set-specific code to create some sort of dialog-box displaying the question string and buttons for ""OK"", ""Cancel"" and ""Help"" or equivalents:  int AskUser(w, string)        Widget          w;        char           *string;  {        int             answer=RET_NONE;	/* some not-used marker */        Widget          dialog;			/* could cache&carry, but ...*/        Arg             args[3];        int             n = 0;        XtAppContext    context;        n=0;        XtSetArg(args[n], XmNmessageString, XmStringCreateLtoR(string,                XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET)); n++;        XtSetArg(args[n], XmNdialogStyle, XmDIALOG_APPLICATION_MODAL); n++;        dialog = XmCreateQuestionDialog(XtParent(w), string, args, n);        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNokCallback, response, &answer);        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNcancelCallback, response, &answer);        XtAddCallback(dialog, XmNhelpCallback, response, &answer);        XtManageChild(dialog);        context = XtWidgetToApplicationContext (w);        while (answer == RET_NONE || XtAppPending(context)) {                XtAppProcessEvent (context, XtIMAll);        }        XtDestroyWidget(dialog);  /* blow away the dialog box and shell */        return answer;  }	The dialog supports three buttons, which are set to call the same function when tickled by the user.  The variable answer is set when the user finally selects one of those choices:  void response(w, client, call)        Widget          w;        XtPointer client;        XtPointer call;  {  int *answer = (int *) client;  XmAnyCallbackStruct *reason = (XmAnyCallbackStruct *) call;        switch (reason->reason) {        case XmCR_OK:                *answer = RET_YES;	/* some #define value */                break;        case XmCR_CANCEL:                *answer = RET_NO; 		break;        case XmCR_HELP:                *answer = RET_HELP;                break;        default:                return;        }}and the code unwraps back to the point at which an answer was needed andcontinues from there.[Thanks to Dan Heller (argv@sun.com); further code is in Dan's R3/contribWidgetWrap library. 2/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 124)  How do I determine the name of an existing widget?I have a widget ID and need to know what the name of that widget is.

Note that the window will be created after the XtRealizeWidget() call, but that the server may not have actually mapped it yet, so you should also wait for an Expose event on the window before drawing into it.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 126)  Why do I get a BadMatch error when calling XGetImage?The BadMatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of the screen. If you don't want to catch the error and deal with it, you can takethe following steps to avoid the error:1) Make a pixmap the same size as the rectangle you want to capture.2) Clear the pixmap to background using XFillRectangle.3) Use XCopyArea to copy the window to the pixmap.4) If you get a NoExpose event, the copy was clean. Use XGetImage to grab theimage from the pixmap.5) If you get one or more GraphicsExpose events, the copy wasn't clean, and the x/y/width/height members of the GraphicsExpose event structures tell you the parts of the pixmap which aren't good.6) Get rid of the pixmap; it probably takes a lot of memory.[10/92; thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com)]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 127)  How can my application tell if it is being run under X?	A number of programs offer X modes but otherwise run in a straightcharacter-only mode. The easiest way for an application to determine that it isrunning on an X display is to attempt to open a connection to the X server:		display = XOpenDisplay(display_name);	if (display)		{ do X stuff }	else		{ do curses or something else }where display_name is either the string specified on the command-line following-display, by convention, or otherwise is (char*)NULL [in which case XOpenDisplay uses the value of $DISPLAY, if set].This is superior to simply checking for the existence a -display command-line argument or checking for $DISPLAY set in the environment, neither of which is adequate. [5/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 128)  How do I make a ""busy cursor"" while my application is computing?Is it necessary to call XDefineCursor() for every window in my application?	The easiest thing to do is to create a single InputOnly window that is as large as the largest possible screen; make it a child of your toplevel window and it will be clipped to that window, so it won't affect any other application. (It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the user enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual desktop.) Substitute ""toplevel"" with your top-most widget here (similar code should work for Xlib-only applications; just use your top Window):     unsigned long valuemask;     XSetWindowAttributes attributes;     /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */     valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor;     attributes.do_not_propagate_mask =  (KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask |         ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask);     attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor(XtDisplay(toplevel), XC_watch);     /* The window will be as big as the display screen, and clipped by        its own parent window, so we never have to worry about resizing */     XCreateWindow(XtDisplay(toplevel), XtWindow(toplevel), 0, 0,         65535, 65535, (unsigned int) 0, 0, InputOnly,         CopyFromParent, valuemask, &attributes);where the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen,particularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than32767.When you want to use this busy cursor, map and raise this window; to go back tonormal, unmap it. This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouseevents; depending on precisely how the window manager works, it may or may nothave a similar effect on keystrokes as well.In addition, note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor resource which can be temporarily reset, should you merely wish to change thecursor without blocking pointer events.[thanks to Andrew Wason (aw@cellar.bae.bellcore.com), Dan Heller (argv@sun.com), and mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu; 11/90,5/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 129)  How do I fork without hanging my parent X program?	An X-based application which spawns off other Unix processes which continue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its children are terminated; the children inherit from the parent the open X connection to the display. 	What you need to do is fork; then, immediately, in the child process, 		close (ConnectionNumber(XtDisplay(widget)));to close the file-descriptor in the display information. After this do your exec. You will then be able to exit the parent.	Alternatively, before exec'ing make this call, which causes the file descriptor to be closed on exec.

No. Xlib and Xt have no mutual exclusion for protecting critical sections. If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which might be while the function you are calling is already executing), it can leavethe library in an inconsistent state. Note that the ANSI C standard pointsout that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler callsany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific toXlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may becalled safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.	You can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupthandler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event whichhas previously been added.	Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly Volume 6 are in error.[Thanks to Pete Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) and Donna Converse (converse@expo.lcs.mit.EDU), 5/92]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 131)  What are these ""Xlib sequence lost"" errors?	You may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error handler, or, more likely, if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or Xlib from a signal handler, which you shouldn't be doing in any case. ----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 132)  How can my Xt program handle socket, pipe, or file input?	It's very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input both from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor, but which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or the other file descriptor.	A solution is use XtAppAddInput(). After you open your file descriptor,use XtAppAddInput() to register an input handler. The input handler will be called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your program's attention. Write the input handler like you would any other Xt callback, so it does its work quickly and returns.  It is important to use onlynon-blocking I/O system calls in your input handlers.	Most input handlers read the file descriptor, although you can have an input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish.	Be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file.You will find that the function is called even when there isn't input pending.XtAppAddInput() is actually working as it is supposed to. The input handler is called whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read, not only when there isnew data to be read. A disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always ready to be read, however, if only because you can spin back to the beginningand read data you've read before.  The result is that your function will almostalways be called every time around XtAppMainLoop(). There is a way to get the type of interaction you are expecting; add this line to the beginning of your function to test whether there is new data:	     if (ioctl(fd, FIONREAD, &n) == -1 || n == 0) return;But, because this is called frequently, your application is effectively in a busy-wait; you may be better off not using XtAppAddInput() and instead setting a timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input.[courtesy Dan Heller (argv@ora.com), 8/90; mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu 5/91;Ollie Jones (oj@pictel.com) 6/92]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 133)  How do I simulate a button press/release event for a widget?	You can do this using XSendEvent(); it's likely that you're not settingthe window field in the event, which Xt needs in order to match to the widgetwhich should receive the event.	 If you're sending events to your own application, then you can use XtDispatchEvent() instead. This is more efficient than XSendEvent() in that youavoid a round-trip to the server.	Depending on how well the widget was written, you may be able to callits action procedures in order to get the effects you want.[courtesy Mark A. Horstman (mh2620@sarek.sbc.com), 11/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 134)  Why doesn't anything appear when I run this simple program?	You are right to map the window before drawing into it. However, the window is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen --until your application receives an Expose event. Drawing done before that will generally not appear. You'll see code like this in many programs; this code would appear after window was created and mapped:  while (!done)    {      XNextEvent(the_display,&the_event);      switch (the_event.type) {	case Expose:	 /* On expose events, redraw */		XDrawLine(the_display,the_window,the_GC,5,5,100,100);		break;	...	}    }	Note that there is a second problem: some Xlib implementations don't set up the default graphics context to have correct foreground/background colors, so this program could previously include this code:  ...  the_GC_values.foreground=BlackPixel(the_display,the_screen);	/* e.g. */  the_GC_values.background=WhitePixel(the_display,the_screen);	/* e.g. */  the_GC = XCreateGC(the_display,the_window,                GCForeground|GCBackground,&the_GC_values);  ... Note: the code uses BlackPixel and WhitePixel to avoid assuming that 1 is black and 0 is white or vice-versa.  The relationship between pixels 0 and 1 and the colors black and white is implementation-dependent.  They may be reversed, or they may not even correspond to black and white at all.Also note that actually using BlackPixel and WhitePixel is usually the wrong thing to do in a finished program, as it ignores the user's preference for foreground and background.And also note that you can run into the same situation in an Xt-based programif you draw into the XtWindow(w) right after it has been realized; it maynot yet have appeared.----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 135)  What is the difference between a Screen and a screen?	The 'Screen' is an Xlib structure which includes the information aboutone of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single X display supports. A server can support several independent screens. They are numbered unix:0.0,unix:0.1, unix:0.2, etc; the 'screen' or 'screen_number' is the second digit --the 0, 1, 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available Screens on this particular Display connection.	The macros which you can use to obtain information about the particularScreen on which your application is running typically have two forms -- onewhich takes a Screen and one with takes both the Display and the screen_number.	In Xt-based programs, you typically use XtScreen(widget) to determine the Screen on which your application is running, if it uses a single screen.	(Part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macroswhich return characteristics of the Screen have ""Display"" in the names -- XDisplayWidth, XDisplayHeight, etc.)	----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 136)  Can I use C++ with X11?

No.  Once set, the background pixel or pixmap of a window cannot be re-read by clients.  The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap,set it to be the background pixmap of a window, and then free the pixmap. The window keeps this background, but the pixmap itself is destroyed.  If you're sure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap), you can use XClearArea() to clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage() to read back that pixel.  However, this action alters the contents of the window, and it suffers from race conditions with exposures. [courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]	Note that the same applies to the border pixel/pixmap. This is a (mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate thepixel/pixmap however it wants.  By not requiring the server to keep the original pixel or pixmap, some (potentially a lot of) space can be saved.

A completely transparent window is easy to get -- use an InputOnlywindow. In order to create a window which is *mostly* transparent, you haveseveral choices:	- the SHAPE extension first released with X11R4 offers an easy way tomake non-rectangular windows, so you can set the shape of the window to fit theareas where the window should be nontransparent; however, not all servers support the extension.	- a machine-specific method of implementing transparent windows forparticular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware.  Note that there is no X notion of a ""transparent color index"".	- a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny windows, but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult.	- a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparentwindow or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your applicationwindow with information; if so, you can draw into separate bitplanes in colorsthat will appear properly.[thanks to der Mouse, mouse@lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU, 3/92; see alsoThe X Journal 1:4 for a more complete answer, including code samples for thislast option]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 140)  Why doesn't GXxor produce mathematically-correct color values?	When using GXxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on abackground of black, for example, should produce white. However, the drawingoperation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices. The color thatthe resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visuallyrandom unless you have actually filled it in yourself. [On many X servers Blackand White often 0/1 or 1/0; programs taking advantage of this mathematicalcoincidence will break.]	If you want to be combining colors with GXxor, then you should be allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosenpre-computed values.	If you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors, then you can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC (graphics context) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over red, say, the result is blue, and when it draws over blue the result is red. This foreground value is itself the XOR of the colormap indices of red and blue.[Thanks to Chris Flatters (cflatter@zia.aoc.nrao.EDU) and Ken Whaley (whaley@spectre.pa.dec.com), 2/91]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 141)  Why does every color I allocate show up as black?

The initial contents of pixmaps are undefined.  This means that mostservers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there -- which is usually garbage.

I want to check whetherthe window exists before doing anything with it.	Because X is asynchronous, there isn't a guarantee that the window would still exist between the time that you got the ID and the time you sent anevent to the window or otherwise manipulated it. What you should do is send theevent without checking, but install an error handler to catch any BadWindow errors, which would indicate that the window no longer exists. This scheme willwork except on the [rare] occasion that the original window has been destroyed and its ID reallocated to another window.[courtesy Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 4/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 145)  Can I have two applications draw to the same window?	Yes. The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources (actually,the server assigns some bits, the client others), and any application that knows the ID can manipulate the resource [almost any X server resource, exceptfor GCs and private color cells, can be shared].	The problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple applications. A simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of theapplications' running on different machines) is in the first application to create a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window ID intoit. The second application then retrieves the property, whose name it alsoknows, and then can draw whatever it wants into the window.	[Note: this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the firstapplication running, and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentionedin the Question about using window IDs on remote displays.]	Note also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level cooperation among your applications. 	Note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to use the same server connection. If one process is a child of the other, it should close down the connection to the server and open its own connection.[mostly courtesy Phil Karlton (karlton@wpd.sgi.com) 6/90]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 146)  Why can't my program work with tvtwm or swm?	A number of applications, including xwd, xwininfo, and xsetroot, do nothandle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use; they typically return the wrong child of root.

Resizing the window is done through the window manager; window managerscan pay attention to the size hints your application places on the window, but there is no guarantee that the window manager will listen.

It's rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself[e.g. by tracking VisibilityNotify events] so that it isn't overlapped -- imagine the conflict between two such programs running.  	The only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stackis to make the window override-redirect; this means that you are temporarilyassuming window-management duties while the window is up, so you want to do this infrequently and then only for short periods of time (e.g. for popup menus or other short parameter-setting windows).[thanks to der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu); 7/92]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 149)  How do I make text and bitmaps blink in X?

Users of Xt have the support of the translation manager to help get notification of double-clicking.	There is no good way to get only a double-click in Xlib, because the protocol does not provide enough support to do double-clicks.  You have to do client-side timeouts, unless the single-click action is such that you can deferactually taking it until you next see an event from the server.  Thus, you have to do timeouts, which means system-dependent code.  On most UNIXish implementations, you can use XConnectionNumber to get the file descriptor of the X connection and then use select() or something similar on that.	Note that many user-interface references suggest that a double-clickbe used to extend the action indicated by a single-click; if this is the casein your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromisecheck the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it, too, shouldbe the single-click action or the double-click action.[Thanks to mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (der Mouse), 4/93]----------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: 151)! How do I render rotated text?		Xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics capabilities, leaving them up to server-extensions or clients-side graphicslibraries.	Your only choice, if you want to stay within the core X protocol, is torender the text into a pixmap, read it back via XGetImage(), rotate it ""by hand"" with whatever matrices you want, and put it back to the server via XPutImage(); more specifically:	1) create a bitmap B and write your text to it.	2) create an XYBitmap image I from B (via XGetImage).	3) create an XYBitmap Image I2 big enough to handle the transformation.	4) for each x,y in I2, I2(x,y) = I(a,b) where 		a = x * cos(theta) - y * sin(theta)		b = x * sin(theta) + y * cos(theta)	5) render I2	Note that you should be careful how you implement this not to losebits; an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better.	The high-level server-extensions and graphics packages available for X also permit rendering of rotated text: Display PostScript, PEX, PHiGS, and GKS,although most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use thesame fonts that would be found on a printer.	In addition, if you have enough access to the server to install a fonton it, you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at somepredefined angle. Your application can then itself figure out placement of eachglyph.[courtesy der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu), Eric Taylor (etaylor@wilkins.bmc.tmc.edu), and Ken Lee (klee@synoptics.com), 11/90;Liam Quin (lee@sq.com), 12/90]	InterViews (C++ UI toolkit, in the X contrib software) has support forrendering rotated fonts in X.  It could be one source of example code.[Brian R. Smith (brsmith@cs.umn.edu), 3/91]	Another possibility is to use the Hershey Fonts; they are stroke-rendered and can be used by X by converting them into XDrawLine requests. [eric@pencom.com, 10/91]	The xrotfont program by Alan Richardson (mppa3@syma.sussex.ac.uk) (posted to comp.sources.x July 14 1992) paints a rotated font by implementing the method above and by using an outline (Hershey) font.	The xvertext package by Alan Richardson (mppa3@syma.sussex.ac.uk) is a set of functions to facilitate the writing of text at any angle.  Version 3.0 was recently released to alt.sources and comp.sources.misc [3/93]; it is also on export as contrib/xvertext.3.0.shar.Z.

(How do I reserve names?)	There are places in the X Toolkit, in applications, and in the Xprotocol that define and use string names.

The MIT X Consortium maintains a registry of names in these domains:orgainization names, selection names, selection targets, resource types,application classes, and class extension record types; and several others.	The list as of 7/91 is in the directory mit/doc/Registry on the R5 tape; it is also available by sending ""send docs registry"" to the xstuff mailserver.

"""Deeply rooted rivalry?"" Ahem, Jokerit have been around since 1967 and joinedthe top flight only in the early '70s. Helsingfors IFK have been around since1897 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 1960s so I thinkyou're exagerating here.That's a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the Canadian &American Olympic teams have been . . . and they've had to play according to ourset of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained aboutas much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, SeanBurke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs inthe NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn McEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been 3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the Kings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I'm sure that an All-Star team assembledfrom the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford or Tampa Bay currently are doing.---But what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end upwith Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire andno Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia? Here is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:(28-30=superstar)(23-27=star)(18-22=NHL regular+)(13-17=NHL regular)( 8-12=role player)FINLAND:  D-Jyrki Lumme.......20D-Teppo Numminen....20D-Peter Ahola.......13C-Jari Kurri........25C-Christian Ruuttu..16R-Teemu Selanne.....27L-Esa Tikkanen......20(Obviously, Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January)SWEDEN:D-Ulf Samuelsson....21D-Fredrik Olausson..20D-Niklas Lidstrom...18D-Calle Johansson...18D-Kjell Samuelsson..17D-Tommy Sjodin......13D-Tommy Albelin......7C-Mats Sundin.......26C-Thomas Steen......18R-Thomas Sandstrom..22R-Ulf Dahlen........18R-Michael Nylander..13L-Per-Erik Eklund...18L-Johan Garpenlov...16L-Mikael Andersson..15L-Jan Erixon........14This would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg'sSelanne & Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York'sTikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. ButI have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team didwell in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts ofMarkus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There'spresumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars atthe highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would bethat the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL.---Sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America.Their points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 topplayers combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in Sweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points.Deducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely onSwedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as highas Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the ""dynasty"" talkisn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have anadvantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time,won't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumablyplay the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn theNorth American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top Scandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a couple of years the same way Edmonton's ""dynasty"" crumbled in the late '80s. Some fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a compromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this, the amateur draft should be open to anyone.",2

"No.  The idea was suggested around here during discussions of possiblenear-term commercial space activities.  One of the folks involved in thosediscussions, aspacecraft engineer named Preston Carter, passed the suggestion on to some entreprenurial types, and Mike Lawson is apparently going ahead withit.  Preston is now at LLNL, and is working with Space Marketing on the sensors that might be carried.Actually, that sounds unlikely.  I don't know what the launch vehiclewould be, but I would expect it to go on a commercial launcher --certainly not on the Shuttle -- and the fraction of the cost paid to NASAfor, e.g.,  launch support would probably cover NASA's incremental costs pretty well.No, as noted, LLNL is involved in lightweight sensor design, per Clementine and related programs.  I'm sure folks around here would like to see a demonstration of a modern inflatable structure, but after all, the U.S. did the Echo satellites long ago, and an advertising structurewould not be much closer to an inflatable space station than Echo was(or a parade balloon, for that matter).While I happen to personally dislike the idea, mostly because I've gota background in astronomy, it's hardly vandalism -- it would be a short-livedintrusion on the night sky, doing no permanent damage and actually hurtingonly a small subset of astronomers.  On the other hand, it would certainlydraw attention to space.

"There seem to be many points to the speaking in tongues thing whichare problematic.  It's use as prayer language seems especially troublingto me.  I understand that when you pray in tongues, the spirit is doingthe talking.  And when you pray, you pray to God.  And the Spirit isGod.  So, the Spirit is talking to Himself.  Which is why I only goby the Pentecost use where it's an actual language.Moreover, the phrase ""though I speak with the tongues of men and angels""used by Paul in I Cor. is misleading out of context.   Some would thenassume that there is some angelic tongue, and if when they speak, itis no KNOWN language, then it is an angelic tongue.Hmmm...in the old testament story about the tower of Babel, we see howGod PUNISHED by giving us different language.  Can we assume then thatif angels have their own language at all, that they have the SAME oneamongst other angels?

"To start with, no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible.  Sothere's a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in agiven context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completelyand makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sumsof money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the otherhand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results whicheventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studiescontradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  ""You people callTHIS science?""   (My opinion, for what it's worth, is that one sees boththese phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)  Some subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigorappropriate for a particular investigation.  I don't believe it is ever possible to banish subjective judgement from science.  My second point, though, is that highly capable people can often makeextremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when usingmethodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think thisis true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approachtheir discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.Within mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially beforethe twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who isfamous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later mathematicians did prove them, of course.)  I think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often notso much a matter of determining what is true and what's not  as it is a matter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of incompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to objectively convince others of the validity of one's results is anessential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step of the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward that goal then one is not doing science.)When a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does andseems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are alsoworthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth furtherinvestigation.  Admittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerableamount of effort in a ""serious scholarly investigation"" such as Isuggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately specific question to try and answer.  The ""science"" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science currently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century.  I certainly wasn't thinking of some idealized science or the mere use of ""reason and observation.""One thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whetherin many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experiencedpractitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies.  Since Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am withthe study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there is any existing research related to this question.  --In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.",5

One interpretation I've heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin of physically abusing one's wife.  The husband is usually physically stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her.  He must honor her as his sister in Christ.  This would therefore be an example of a specific sin that blocks prayer.This verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what is God's will for his family without consulting his wife.  God reveals His will to both the husband and the wife.  There needs to be some degree of mutuality in decision making.  Even those whose understanding of the Bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the husband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family.  One way to look at it is that God speaks to the wife through the husband and to the husband through the wife.,7

"[reply to frank@D012S658.uucp (Frank O'Dwyer)]    From A Dictionary of Philosophy, by Anthony Flew: ""Objectivism:  The belief that there are certain moral truths that wouldremain true whatever anyone or everyone thought or desired.  Forinstance, 'No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on anothersimply to take pleasure in his suffering' might be thought of as aplausible example.  Even in a world of sadists who all rejected it, thecontention remains true, just as '5 + 7 = 12' remains correct even ifthere is no one left to count.  The problem for the objectivist is todetermine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can beestablished.  If we accept that such judgements are not reports of whatis but only relate to what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) thenthey cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world.  Norcan they be analytic, since this would involve lack of action-guidingcontent;  'One ought always to do the right thing' is plainly true invirtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide toaction (see analytic and synthetic).  At this point the objectivist maytalk of 'self-evident truths', but can he deny the subjectivist's claimthat self-evidence is in the mind of the beholder?  If not, what is leftof the claim that some moral judgements are true?  THe subjectivist maywell feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgementswith which he would wish to associate himself.

Thanks a million...BTW- Anyone who works/has worked for Atari, I could really use your help with info on the old 2600, please email me if you are willing to help me.... thatnksalot!!",4
"Sjogren's syndrome has been known to induce dryness in vaginal tissue as wellas induce primary biliary cirrhosis. Otherwise the abdominal swelling could bedue to a complication of Sjogren's known as pseudolymphoma which *can* producea splenomegaly (enlarged spleen).

"If you would bother to check in any good dictioanry or thesaurus, I thinkyou will find that ""arrogance"" has to do with an offensive exhibition ofpresumed or real superiority (a paraphrase from my own Webster's).Arrognace is about pride and haughtiness. A person can believe in absolutetruth, even blindly (whatever that means) without being obnoxious about it.Just as a person can be a ""humble,"" authority-questioning,defying-any-theist-to-reply athiest and be quite arrogant. Arrogance is notabout what you believe, it is about how you relate to what you believe andhow you present it to others. If your overwhelming experience of Christianshas been that they are arrogant, I apologozing both for myself and on thebehalf of those who have offfended you. But my own experience, at least inforums like Usenet where you see a good mix of people, is that arrogantChristians and athiests seems to occur in about equal numbers.- Phil -",7
"Are you your own master?  Do you have any habits that you cannot break?For one, you seem unable to master your lack of desire to understandeven the slightest concept of the Bible.  Seems that ignorance has youmastered.  How about sexual sins?  Gotta any of those secret desiresin your head that you harbor but can get control of?   Do you dehumanizewomen when they walk past you?  Do you degrade them to a sex object inyour head?  Are you the master of that kind of thinking?  Do you insultpeople unknowingly, then regret it later.  Yet do it again the nexttime opportunity presents itself?  Are you truly the master of yourself?I have admitted that I am not the master of my thought life at all times.That I sometimes say things I do want to say, and then repeat my mistakeunwantingly.  I have admitted to myself that I cannot control every aspectof my being.  There are times I know I shouldn't say something, butthen say it anyway.  There are times I simply forget a lesson.I, in fact, am not my own master.  I need help.  Jesus promised methis help.  And I took him up on his offer.  I have willfully letJesus be my master because Jesus knows what is better for me thanI myself do.  And why not?  Does not the creator know his creationbetter than the creation?  Does Toyota know what's better for theCorolla than the Corolla?Then I guess ignorance is bliss for you.  Because Brian, you enjoynot having a clue about the Bible.   Can you witness motherly love with your senses?  How does caring andconcern for you register with your senses?  If nothing registersto you other than what you can see, taste, smell, hear and touch,then you better become a Vulcan and fast.  You better get ridof your emotions.And I do have a good reason to believe what I do.The topic was about my God and your lack of knowledge about what myGod says.   My God says that you will not CEASE EXISTING.  You havelife forever.  You can choose to either live it in hell in eternaltorment where there is no communication whatsoever, or can choose to live it in paradise with God.  That is what my God says.  And thatwas the issue.  Your made-up theism is what it is--made up.  It'swishful thinking. Is this the religion of Kendigianism?  Most people are not Christian.  Mostpeople, including Christians,  are not fond of feeling that theyare imperfect.  Is ""the world an undesireable place"" a doctrineof Kendigianism?  It has nothing to do with my God.  DoesKendigism have magical mystical prayers as a part of its worship?Mine doesn't.  Does Kendigianism believe that the world will be holy again?  Mine doesn't.  Does Kendigianism also dictate that one must obey what thepriest tells them like good little sheep?  Mine doesn't.  Is thisa bunch of lies you tell yourself so that you can justify being ignorant of the Bible?Brian, following Christ has nothing to do with the doctrines of Kendigianism.You would find any of your doctrines in the Bible.   I don't follow Kendigianism.I follow Christ.   Also, to try to again show you your ignoranceof Christ and the Bible in regards to ""priests"",  have you not read aboutthe sole Melchizedek priest in Hebrews 7 and 8?  Have you not read what thepurpose is of the Old Testament Levitical priesthood and why there shouldNOT be priests today?  Yes, guess what?  The Catholics messed up.  I donot follow Catholicism or any ""ism.""  I follow Christ.Why would you want to live a good life?To you, you die and that's it.  Don't contradict yourself.  You haveno reason to live a good life.  It doesn't do you any good in theend.  Your life doesn't do anybody else any good  either becauseeveryone dies anyway.  So you have no reason to lead a good life. Leadinga good life is meaningless.   Why do you do such a meaningless thing?Has the resurrection sunk in?  Jesus is alive.  Jesus is NOT dead.Jesus was sacrified to fufill the Old Testament sacrificial systemin its every detail.  Jesus's death was like a seed.  He neededto fall to the ground so that many new lives would take root.  Didyou miss the entire John passage as well?  Forget that I am a person.  Forget that I know how to type.  Forgetthat I know how to put a sentence together.  Forget that I knowhow to send e-mail.   Forget my existence.  Proove to me that Iexist.  .",11

"orthereOkay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound.The original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how tomake sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam valuesinto all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This wasbecauseof how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was byscanningthis block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy onsome machines).When the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed togenerate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we hadoncedocumented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant ""Iwant toplay a mono sound"" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retractedthedocumentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layersofsound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if youwantto make stereo sound.Enter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager areinconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port fromtheIBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for gamewriters to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.Since the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound outputhardware,and the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBaseworks.On some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBasegets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra700/900/950at least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channelonly.Both are technically correct interpretations of the originalspecification,but one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.If developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), monosounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of theunderlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate leftchannel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, theirgames will only come out the left on some games.The other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel soundon the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related.It is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards ofthe different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds whichare actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter whatmachineyou have.Now, to more directly address the question, the games you list:and alsoHellcats,Super TetrisOxyd(and many more, these are just what I've tested)Cheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.Other games you list:and alsoPGA Tour GolfCivilization(and more, these are again only from personal experience)Use the sound manager and work fine on all machines.The more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT!Really, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about todo,but I'm going say it anyway.Stop cheating on sound!Really soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakerswill be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace periodis about to end.The Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and willworkeven better soon, so use it.In conclusion:To Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug.To Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to sendsoundto both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care ofautomatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on allhardware.Have fun.Disclaimer number 1:I don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed.So don't write me with sound questions.Disclaimer number 2:If it says up above that I wrote anything like ""the grace period is aboutto end"" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically notallowed to say anything like that. You know what I mean.Disclaimer number 3:I don't speak for Apple, just me.",14

"So in other words, if Roussel shuts out the Sharks and Soderstrom shuts outthe Penguins, that's immaterial because it was the coaches decision? Come on,Joe, think about what you're saying! Who they played is VERY significant.Why they played them is what's irrelevent. A low GAA against good teamsis better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing twogoaltenders. A low GAA is better then a higher GAA. A low GAA against goodteams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the contextof comparing two goaltenders.YES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**.Of course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how youget them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're acoach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, youhave got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Torontogame, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing inthat game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The samefor Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made agreat play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. Ifyou were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goaliestand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Rousseldoesn't have a game like that in him.Don't be so sure of that. FLYERS management never says bad thing aboutRoussel, but they don't say too much on the good side either. I've seenat least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he wasto have two good goaltenders, it was Tommy this, Tommy that, and oh, yeah,Dom has played well too.FLYERS in the NHL Hall of Fame. Kinda dull, really. They handed out ateam picture to everybody who walked in from Pizza Hut, but it was thesame picture they sold in the programs in mid-season. Had names like Benning,Kasper...Mostly random seat locations, some were given out by having certainautographs on the team photos.

"I am not sure if this is the proper group to post this to but here goes anyway. About five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes under one of her arms. After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor  suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue. While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being  manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm ( palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is  persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3 and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides minor reductions in pain and is only short term.   My questions are:      Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the     levels of pain?     Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced?     Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored?  Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated.      Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group.  If anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup  that I should be posting this to it would also be appreciated.",5

"First, I would like to say how much I appreciate having so literate anderudite an individual as Mr. Rutledge with whom to discuss this topic.Frankly, most anti-RKBA posters refuse even to approach the topic ofthe original understanding of the Bill of Rights as detailed in thewritings of the era. This  is most refreshing.Second, I must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days.My brigade's quarterly drill was this weekend and I needed to attendto several matters pertaining to the State Militia.Some people seem to feel that the concept of the Militia is an anachro-nism that is out of place in the 20th century. I'm not sure the Swisswould agree and I think perhaps a discussion of how the Militia, bothorganized and unorganized, fits into the defense plans of my State,Mississippi. Please do not assume that this describes something peculiarto one southern state. For instance, the Commonwealth of Massachusettshas a well organized Militia which, members report, maintains stocksof both riot guns and machine guns. The laws of other States will varybut are probably similar.Title 35  of Mississippi Code defines our Militia as ""all able-bodiedcitizens of the state between the ages of seventeen (17) and sixty-two (62) years..."". The Militia is divided into 3 classes: The NationalGuard, the Mississippi State Guard and the unorganized Militia.  TheNational Guard is a strange sort of fish from a Constitutional perspective.It tries to be both State Militia and Federal Reserve. The discussionof this ""para-constitutional"" arrangement is quite interesting in itselfbut somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion. Suffice it that, at thisdate, the National Guard has ceased to have any Constitutional standingas anything but a Federal reserve force.Mississippi, and most other States, maintains a purely State organizedMilitia. In Mississippi this is called The State Guard. In other States it may be called something else. The State Guard exists asa cadre or training corps made up of mostly experienced officers andsenior NCOs who serve as volunteers without compensation. We drillon a monthly basis at the company and battalion level, brigade oncea quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization. OurState-authorized cadre strength is 694. This is a skeleton of anorganization without any flesh. The muscle and sinew when needed willcome from the unorganized Militia.In time of invasion, insurrection or calamity the Governor can orderthe activation of the State Guard. When this takes place a call willfirst be made  for volunteers to fill the organization out to eitherits contingency strength of 2194 or full strength of 4910. In theevent that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer, the lawprovides detailed instructions for the conducting of a draft of theunorganized Militia. The size of the State Guard is not specified bylaw, but rather by executive order. At one time, the organized Militiaof Mississippi consisted of 68 regiments. Needless to say, the Statedoes not have armories brimming with weapons with which to equip sucha force. The historical precedent for arming such a force is by useof mostly the private arms of the Militiamen. It is my hope that demonstrates that State Militias are far from beingthe long dead anachronisms that some may wish to claim.Regarding Hamilton: If you take Hamilton's opinion as being the solerepresentative of the opinions of the Founding Fathers, you will havechosen a highly skewed sample set. Hamilton was on the extreme Federalistend of the political spectrum. Others, such as Coxe and Henry, canbe chosen to represent the other end. Many contemporaries felt thatthe idea of having a standing Army of any sort or even a select Militiaor ""train bands"" were contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern-ment they were striving to perfect. The compromise reached was toprovide for a small Army, which had to be refinanced every two years,and iron-clad protection for the Militia, which was to remain ever,""terrible and irresistible"".These protections included: State control, not Federal; limitationof Federal utilization of the Militia (i.e. execute Laws, suppressInsurrections and repel Invasions), and the Right to Keep and BearArms to prevent what the British had tried to do at Lexington.These limitations eventually proved so onerous to the Federal Govern-ment that they were skirted by the creation of the National Guard.The National Guard was created for one very simple reason: the Constitutional Militia was had proved too unreliable for fightingwars of imperial expansion. (e.g. Spanish-American War). TheConstitution provided that the Militia could only be employed bythe Federal government in very limited purposes. As far back as theWar of 1812, Militia units had refused to leave United Statesterritory to attack the enemy. Further, there was no Constitutionalauthorization for any conscription of anyone into the FederalMilitary and Militiamen were particularly protected. In all wars untilWW-I every American who left the country under arms was a volunteer.When the National Guard acts of 1903-1916 required that each newmember also enlist as a reservest in the Army, existing soldiers were""grandfathered"". At least one of these ""grandfathered"" individualsrefused to go to France in 1918 and his refusal was upheld by theFederal Courts.Mr. Rutledge has stated that the Second Amendment applies only tomembers of a ""well organized"" militia. However, the pre-Constitutionalhistory of the American Militia shows relatively few periods whenThe Militia came close to meeting either Messrs. Rutledge or Hamilton'sdefinition of ""well organized"". In the period of peace between theFrench & Indian War and The Revolution many companies simply stoppeddrilling and had to be reconstituted just prior to The Revolution.Perhaps Mr. Rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestorswho answered the Lexington alarm had forfeited their rights becausetheir units didn't drill for a few years in the 1760s. I would notbe so bold.Again, I wish to repeat. The National Guard, for all its merits, isnot the Militia described by the Constitution  nor by Mr. Hamiltonnor by Mr. Henry nor by Mr. Coxe. The fact that the Federal Governmentand many States are delinquent in their attentions to and organizingof their Constitutional Militias  diminishes neither theirresponsibilities nor the rights of the Militia as detailed in theConstitution. Misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the Militia is but oneerror that has crept into modern readings of the Constitution. TheConstitution prohibits States from keeping ""Troops or Ships of Warin time of Peace"". I have heard some insist this prevents States frommaintaining a Militia, but this comes about because people today do notunderstand the meanings of the words in their 18th century usage.Today we call any large vessel a ""ship"" but in the 18th century the worddescribed a particular kind of vessel.  A ""ship"" is a large vessel withthree or more masts each carrying square rigged sails. A ""brig"" has twomasts. In the contemporary usage the States were prohibited only from keepingthe largest warships of the day, those capable of global operations. Today'sequivalent might be a prohibition on the States' keeping nuclear missiles.""Troops"" at this time meant a full-time professional military organization.Any study of contemporaneous writings will bear this out. In at least one respect, I am in agreement with Mr. Rutledge; beingpersonally involved in the maintenance and advancement of The Militiaas a viable means of defense for a modern society, I am frequentlyboth bemused and saddened when friends and associates wax poetic ontheir place in the unorganized Militia and become strangely silent orscarce when invited to attend a  drill of their State's Militia.",8
"We have no way of knowing because we cannot separate Morris' contribu-tion  from the rest of the team's.  There is only one way of determin-ing ""best"" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  atthe  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the bestthat day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  themost  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine thebest of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro-cess  used to determine the ""best"" is the score of the game and it re-lates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no methodinherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And thatis how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-solutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player Bin their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens hasdone  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But youhave  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   theindividual's  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is theonly measure of ""best"" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base-ball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham-pionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub-jective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you canpredict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.Exactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  withClemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens.I am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totallymeaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based onhis ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.You don't have to be rude.For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire pointof  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - IgnoratioElenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   becausehe   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimedthat in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   anindividual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose ofcomparing that individual's performance with another individual's per-formance.The stats are a nice hobby and  that's  about  it.  There  is  no  newknowledge being produced.  So when a poster claims that Morris is betterthan Clemens because he has more rings, the poster is no more nor less incorrect than the rest of you baying hounds.--",19

"Thanks to all those people who recommended Workspace managers forWindows 3.1.  I found 3 shareware Workspace Managers, from Australia'sMS-WINDOWS archive (monu6.cc.monash.edu.au), which mirrors somesites in the U.S.  The three I found were:1. WORKSPACES 1.10 (wspace.zip)                                This was the smallest and simplest   of the workspace managers that I found.  It is very easy to use.   It displays a small window, containing 6 buttons, plus an extra   button for configuration purposes.  One annoying feature was the   title window that is first presented when it is run - you must press   a key (not a mouse button!) for the thing to go away.  Also, it would   have been nice if there was an ""ALWAYS ON TOP"" setting for the little   window containing the workspace buttons.  Maybe some user-specified   strings on the buttons instead of the numbers one to six might be   a nice feature.  The simplicity and ease of use of this workspace   manager makes it an attractive package.2. WORKSHIFT 1.6 (wrksft16.zip)                               While this workspace manager offered a   few features that WORKSPACES 1.10 lacked, it was quite time consuming   to set things up.  With WORKSPACES 1.10, all but the first workspace   is initially empty.  With WORKSHIFT 1.6, you need to take ""snapshots""   of how you want each of your workspaces to look like - i.e. what    applications they contain.  Also, the main window is quite large,   but this does allow you to have a small view of what is in each workspace.   With WORKSPACES 1.10, there was no facility for viewing what was in   a workspace without switching to it.  WORKSHIFT 1.6 provides this   viewing functionality which is quite useful.3. BIGDESK 2.30 and BACKMENU (backdesk.zip)                            This is an interesting package, which contains   a few other goodies as well as a workspace manager.  Other goodies   include ""Backmenu"", which provides a pop-up root menu when you   press a certain mouse button - just like in X-Windows.  The menu   is totally configurable, offering unlimited depth of cascading menus,   which is provides quite handy access to applications.  You could   say it is a menu-based alternative to the program manager.  Also   bundled in ""backdesk.zip"" is a program called ""WRUN"", which allows   you to run windows applications from a DOS shell under WINDOWS   instead of using the File Manager to run applications.     The actual workspace manager is called BIGDESK 2.30.  BIGDESK works quite   differently to the other two workspace managers in that it   doesn't provide a certain number of disjoint and separate workspaces.   In fact, it basically enlarges your desktop by a configurable amount,   and you choose which region of the desktop you want your screen to   focus in on.  This means you can have windows overlapping between different   viewing regions, unlike the first two workspace managers in which   each workspace was isolated from the other one.  The BIGDESK control window   allows to to move windows around your enlarged desktop.  Basically   the control window provides a small scale view of your viewing area   while your actual computer screen provides a large scale or blow-up   of a particular section.",12

"Aspartame is the methyl ester of a dipeptide, so a product of itshydrolysis is going to be methanol, which can then be oxidized toformaldehyde.  The amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion ofaspartame-containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise,since you're forming equally minute amounts of methanol from othercomponents of food all the time.  In studies involving administrationof high doses of the additive, blood methanol levels were undetectable.Methanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings,say 5ml and above.  This is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehydeand formic acid, two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levelscan damage tissues like the retina and kidney, because at such high dosesthe body's detoxification system is overwhelmed.  Interestingly, onetreatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk onethyl alcohol--vodka or an equivalent.  That's because ethanol ismetabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver.If the methanol stays as methanol and isn't metabolized to formaldehyde,it is actually relatively non-toxic.",5

So, GM decided to conver their350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter).  Bigmistake.  The engine was not redesigned, but converted.  The enginecould not handle the higher compression, etc.  Lots of problems withthese cars.  This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer --DON""T BUY A DIESEL.  THEY ARE BAD.  This was a gross generalization.Ask yourself this question -- if your livelihood depended on driving,LOTS of it, would you use a dependable or undependable (but cheaperin the short run) vehicle?  What do Greyhound busses have in them?Trailer Trucks?  Even Train Locomotives?  Are these gasoline engines?No, they are diesel.  Tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a500,000 mile warrantee with they vehicles.I own an `82 Diesel Suburban.  The 6.2L diesel is a GREAT engine.Just keeps going.  It was more expensive (when new) than the gasolineengine vehicle was.  The only problem with diesel engines is that when they need to be rebuilt, they are expensive.  In a gas 350engine, you will pay about $1000 for a rebuild.  Diesel 6.2L is about$2000.  But then again, the diesel engine lasts about twice as longand gets about 50% better mileage.  A carburator for a gasoline enginecosts about $100 to rebuild (or less).  A rebuild of the fuel injectionpump on a diesel will cost about $500 (or more).  But then again,you never need a tune-up.If you're looking at a rebuilt 6.2L, I'd say you got a great deal.Check to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also.",17

"[snip](the 3DO is not a 68000!!!)[snip]The 3DO box is based on an ARM RISC processor, one or two custom graphicschips, a DSP, a double-speed CDROM, and 2MB of RAM/VRAM. (I'm a littlefuzzy on the breakdown of the graphics chips and RAM/VRAM capacity).It was demonstrated at a recent gathering at the Electronic Cafe inSanta Monica, CA. From 3DO, RJ Mical (of Amiga/Lynx fame) and HalJosephson (sp?) were there to talk about the machine and their plan. Wegot to see the unit displaying full-screen movies using the CompactVideo codec(which was nice, very little blockiness showing clips from Jaws and Backdraft)... and a very high frame rate to boot (like 30fps).Note however that the 3DO's screen resolution is 320x240.CompactVideo is pretty amazing... I also wanted to point out that QuickTimedoes indeed slow down when one dynamically resizes material as was statedabove... I'm sure if the material had been compressed at the large sizethen it would play back fine (I have a Q950 and do this quite a bit). Theprice of generality... personally I don't use the dynamic sizing of moviesoften, if ever. But playing back stuff at its original size is plenty quickon the latest 040 machines.I'm not sure how a Centris/20MHz 040 stacks up against the 25 MHz ARM inthe 3DO box. Obviously the ARM is faster, but how much?",1

"A method which will directly (almost) provide you with the information thatyou require is that which is commonly used for coordinate measurements of human body landmarks (eg. the SELSPOT system by SELSPOT AB, Sweden, and theWATSMART System ??).

In escence,the detector is a large photodiode with four cathodes (one on each of thefour sides of the square detector crystal) and a single anode (the back ofthe crystal).  A spot of light will produce currents which are proportionalto the position of the spot on the detector's face.

"Our shop uses a package called CADCore - very good - to scan andsubsequently vectorize original maps into digital maps.

"My knowledge about driving in the U.S. is also second-hand, but I think I cancorrect your statements about our Autobahn:Oh yeah, that would be paradise... in fact, you can forget it. From all I'veheard from my U.S. relatives, drivers esp. here in Germany are much more agg-ressive, but not disciplined. One of my relatives, a L.A. resident, hired a carat the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home. He said then thathe grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore he'd never drive a car inGermany again (this was in 1982 and he kept his promise - the situation now iseven worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic).What you mean by `better disciplined' should perhaps be considered `cautious dueto fear': When driving around here, you always *have* to take into consideration that themajority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you: They expect that nobodyfails or sleeps; many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car cango (of course only where that is allowed, you might think - dream on :).So any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health - and if you're ex-posed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver, you learn tohandle it - or you lose... That's the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation - whether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you; I think we handlea very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest (compared tothe volume) and decreasing rates of lethal accidents - OTOH, more and morepeople (esp. women) dislike driving (because they feel overtaxed and threatened)and each accident is one accident too much.Better designed and maintained, may be - but animal fences are very rare. Auto-bahnen and many other streets have guard-rails (I hope that's the right word - a plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights; it's about 2 feet high);those guard-rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road. Smaller animalscan crawl under the plank, bigger ones can easily jump over it. The point isthat esp. larger animals are very rare in Germany; they tend also to be verytimid. Accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger.You're right (there are speed linits even on the major part of the Autobahn) -but the attitude towards driving (see above) seems to be very similar to thatin Germany (I've been in France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Spain, Belgium,the Netherlands) - besides that, you really can't rely on the residents abidingthe local speed limits. I've got quite a lot of practise (~120k miles) and I'mused to travel at 130 mph (FYI, with a car even smaller than a rabbit), but Iconsider driving on the highways round Paris or Milano really a thrill...Sorry, but you'll find quite a lot rabbit-class-car (or even smaller, mine is aPeugeot 205) owners going that fast; small cars with much HP are very `hip' overhere - and most people buying such cars aren't afraid to let them run.I disagree; the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant. Formula-1 carsweigh less than 700 kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at130 mph or higher - OTOH when crashing against a solid object at 130 mph,it makes no difference whether you sit in a Porsche, a Mercedes, a tank or ona bicycle: Your're dead.Bye,Stefan---Stefan Dalibor (dalibor@immd3.uni-erlangen.de)",17

"I've been a very intent NREN spectator of the NREN for years.  As a commercial IP software vendor, it really is my professional opinion that the NREN, at this point, is irrelevant to private sector networking.  If it had been deployed five years ago, it would have been a major development.  Now,however, it's just an upgrade to the NSFnet, and an attempt to revive the lagging use of the national supercomputer centers.  You could cut out the NSFnet completely, and the Internet would continue chugging along without a hiccup (aside from a few universities).Long-haul networking and Internet connectivity have long since ceased to be under federal sponsorship or regulation, at least in the USA.  The success of the CIX (Commercial Internet Exchange) is a prime example of this.  While our dear VP has been promoting his ""data superhighway,"" the private sector has been building it, without the NSFnet's restrictions.To illustrate, a connection from the machine on my desk to the machine your article was posted from (pizzabox.demon.co.uk) involves *only* commercial IP providers until it hits Amsterdam.

Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine?In the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque,but 4's make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low.So for 4's, splitfires would not significantly increase power.But what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins,but many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up forthe hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell, Daytona 1992).  However,twins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does thistranslate?  Increased torque should ""theoretically"" help twins makemore power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra modsor anything made, just stick 'em in.Now I don't know about all of this (and I'm trying to catch up withsomebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than4's.        As far as racing teams....  Ducati team ""Fast by Ferraci"" usedsplitfires in the 1989 season (this is when they had Jamie Jamesrunning for em), but I don't know why they stopped since then.Also, somebody check to see if they had them in 88.....Peace.Warrenwcd82671@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu""Have Suzuki, will travel...""At a local ""fix-er-up-er"" shop, the bike repairest looked at adumped ZX-7.

":Just a bit off, Phil.  We don't reprocess nuclear fuel because what:you get from the reprocessing plant is bomb-grade plutonium.  It is:also cheaper, given current prices of things, to simply fabricate new:fuel rods rather than reprocess the old ones, creating potentially:dangerous materials (from a national security point of view) and then:fabricate that back into fuel rods.Fabricating with reprocessed plutonium may result in something that may gokind of boom, but its hardly decent bomb grade plutonium.  If you want bombgrade plutonium use a research reactor, not a power reactor.  But if you wanta bomb, don't use plutonium, use uranium.",6

"I just wanted to let everyone know that I have lost what little respect I havefor Jim LeFebvre after seeing today's Cubs game. First of all how could hestart Maldonado over May. After the way May played at the end of last year andthe way he tore up the Cactus League how could you let him sit the bench? Notto mention that a right hander (Maddux) started. I really blew my top whenLefebvre pinch hit for Rick Wilkins with TOMMY SHIELDS! How can you do thatjust because of the lefty-righty thing, too much is made of that. Wilkins istwice the hitter that Shields is. Then the next batter was Jose Vizcaino, oneof the weakest hitters I have ever seen, and who had looked terrible at bat allday, and Lefebre let him hit, while May still sat the bench. I think even ArnieHarris was stunned by this because he showed May sitting in the dugout whileVizcaino was batting. Face it Lefebvre has got to be the worst manager inbaseball.

"So long as we think that good things are what we *have* to do rather thanwhat we come to *want* to do, we miss the point. The more we love God; themore we come to love what and whom He loves.When I find that what I am doing is not good, it is not a sign to tryeven harder (Romans 7:14-8:2); it is a sign to seek God. When I am aware of Jesus' presence, I usually want what He wants. It is His strenth, His love that empowers my weakness.",7

"Wow, the WWII channel did something not-WWII?The graphics capabilities of the computers were very faked for movie audiences who have not ability or patience with numbers.  The book was more realistic in that respect.  In all respects, actually.  The robotics are still out of range, but not impossible.SF (and I""ve always wondered how Crichton escapes this classification) is usually ahead of science in both prediction and precaution.  NASA's decontaimination processes were supposedly taken to prevent SF story disasters.  I mean, NASA scientists were often SF readers (and sometimes writers) and felt pre-warned by their reading.I think the film still holds up among the best of SF films, but that isn't saying a whole lot.",5

I mess with this olderstuff alot.   Kinda fun.  8)     First problem I can forsee is that the ST-251 will not becompadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios rom.      Check the numbers on it.  It should be the only non-smt chip onthe board.  Slightly below center, and left.    The bios should read either :     62-000042-015 or             62-000094-0x2     If the last 3 digits are 013, you got problems.    Looks right.   W5 and W7 are factory jumped (with a trace) betweenpins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address.    Looks right.  [art deleted]      I notice you left out the S1 jumper table settings.   Those arewhat control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you havethe 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this:              5 + +    open              6 + +    open                           7 + +    open                      8 + +    open              4 + +    closed              3 + +    closed              2 + +    open              1 + +    open    Note:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block.Top to bottom.   +'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 3,4, and 8select the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select thesecond drive (drive 1).         If you have the 62-000094 rom, it's a auto-config, and I'll haveto look up how to do it... I don't have the big book right here.      See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are notright.   Also,  at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cablesare on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251, try moving itto the opposite side of the drive.    It's one or the other.        The narrow data cable goes to J2.   I've thrown it on J3 a fewtimes and banged my head for a day.....     Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   A quick wayto check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter:               -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt)       This will return the rom date, if it's of any use.      If I oversimplified any of the above, I appologize.     It'sjust hard to know what caliber of person I'm talking to. 8).                     -->   Bob Valentine  <--                    --> ravalent@mailbox.syr.edu <--  From chpp@unitrix.utr.ac.za Mon Apr  5 06:33:46 1993Received: from unitrix.utr.ac.za by ponder (5.61/1.36)	id AA16194; Mon, 5 Apr 93 06:32:59 -0500Received: by unitrix.utr.ac.za (Smail3.1.28.1 #1)	id m0nfpMA-0001X7C; Mon, 5 Apr 93 13:28 GMTMessage-Id: <m0nfpMA-0001X7C@unitrix.utr.ac.za>From: chpp@unitrix.utr.ac.za (Prof P.

When using a Western Digital XT controller card the system will           not ""boot.""  To solve this problem, one of the ROM BIOS chips           must be disabled.  To disable the BIOS on your Western Digital            XT controller card, you must remove the jumper at position W-3           or add a jumper at position R-23 (depending on which model of XT           controller you are using).                                                 -2-                    NOTE 2:  TANDY 1000 SYSTEMS - The WD1002A-WX1, WD1004A-WX1,           WDXT-GEN2 and the WD1004-27X can be modified to operate in           Tandy 1000 series computers, models SX, TX and the original or           ""A"" version.  These computers utilize an interrupt of 2 (IRQ2)           instead of IRQ5, the IBM standard.  To modify the WD1002A-WX1 or           the WD1002-27X to operate in these systems, you must cut the           etch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position W-7.  Then           solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (W-7).  To complete the           modification, a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch S-1           (2 rows of 8 pins).  PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY PHYSICAL MODIFICATION           TO YOUR WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DISK CONTROLLER VOIDS THE WARRANTY           ON YOUR BOARD.  To modify the WD1004A-WX1, WDXT-GEN2 or the           WD1004-27X for your Tandy 1000 system, a zero ohm resister must           be soldered to jumper position W-27.

"Greetings. I've been seeing the word ""storage"" mentioned	around oscilliscopes but I'm curious, what does it mean?	If my life depended on it, I'd say that it's a scope that	uses long-persistance phosphor to keep the successive	taces on the screen for some unit of time - ""store"" them.	Do I get to live?	Also, I've been shopping for a decent, used, [old] scope	since my Tek 514A (portable...NOT!) and my Heathkit O-1000	are all single trace and I need more... like 2 or 3 and at	least 50MHz (maybe 100...)	During my shopping at hamfests etc. I've run into the 	problem of ""old scope"" terminology. I can imagine what	a ""mainframe"" and ""plug-in"" are but some things like	the above ""storage"", ""coax input"" (Hey, where do I get a 	probe that fits this? I had to fiddle with mine for a week 	before I got anything resembling ""a good trace"" - they all	come with BNC connectors!), ""unblanking"" (huh?), and, oh,	just like my 514 manuals, MANY changes were made along the	way to the schematic - scopes, even with IDENTICAL model 	numbers, have different (better?) response/performance than	others - how can I pick the better one? Does the rule of the	higher SN the better apply?	Take care.",4

"I just purchased The Norton Desktop for windows, and I also haveNorton Utilities.  When I installed NDW, it wanted to rem out the linethat installed EP (EP /ON) and the command to invoke the Image utility.It replaced the Image command with a new image command that invokes theversion of Image that came with NDW.  This makes sense, as presumably theImage version with NDW is newer than the one with NU.  It did not, however,install smartcan in the autoexec.  Now two questions:   1:  Will NU use the image data saved by the newer version of image invoked.       i.e. Are the two version of Image compatable?   2:  Will erase protect use the info from smartcan, and vice versa?       I use both dos and windows, and I want to make sure that when I       erase files in either environment, they are going to be protected.From the experiments I have run, The two programs (Erase Protect andsmart Erase) don't use each others info.I currently have both EP and smartcan loading within my autoexec, andI don't see any conflicts;FYI :  Norton Desktop for Windows version 2.2       Norton Util's version 6",12
I was waiting for this. I think your question should be rephrased. The manyverses of the Bible which condem homosexuality (by our beliefs) have beenshoved down the throats of homosexuals for a long time by (well-meaning?)Christians. The question is how do they interpret these verses. Any discussionof any issue (this or any other issue) requires a proof of your case as wellas a disproof of the opposing view. We are already familiar with those versesand many have proven to themselves that these condem homosexual behaviour. Wemust now establish reasons for not believing this to be true based on theinterpretation of these scriptures given by someone who has come to grips withthem.,7

"I had this problem some time ago.  Some BIOSes do not automatically install COM3 or COM4 in the port tables. Programs like most modem programs which write directly to the port work fine but anything that uses a BIOS call fails. Find a BBS or FTP site where you can get a copy of PORT FINDER. Put ""device=pf.sys"" in your config.sys or run pf.com from your autoexec.bat. This little program will locate all existing ports and make sure the BIOS tables are updated. It works great.

Credit for time served (in jail,waiting for trial) and you are out in 12 months, worst case.  If we would putcriminals, especially violent ones, in the slam for true sentences, crime woulddrop.  Instead, we reward them for being good and let them out early, veryearly.Serbs, Croats and Muslims have been killing each other almost since before theinvention of guns.  Old women are throwing stones at UN trucks.  This is ahatred that goes beyond reason.Yes, the problem is the user.

"I don't doubt that this will be the attitude of many corporate leaders.It's understandable--most corporate execs don't know much about cryptology,and it's easy to get taken in by someone peddling snake oil.  And, theproposed scheme *is* a major improvement in telephone security to whatexists now.    The problem is that, with any security scheme of this kind, you have toconcern yourself with the weakest link in the chain.  I suspect that NSAhas put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of theirs,probably at least as strong as (say) DES in OFB-mode.  Unfortunately, theexistence of the key-registry system seems to make possible all kinds ofpossible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build (say)a DES keysearch machine.    As originally described, it sounded like any police / court combinationcould acquire the key for a given chip.  I hope that's not the case, sinceit would imply a glaring hole.  (How much does it cost to find *one* crookedjodge and *one* crooked cop?  Especially for a foreign intelligence agencyor organized crime boss?)  However, even if more intelligent schemes are usedto allow access to the unencrypted phone conversations, there will be weak-nesses.  They may be very expensive, and very difficult.  But who wouldtrust his/her confidential information to an encryption scheme that, for(say) $100,000 could by cracked one time in a hundred?  (DES, for all thecomplaints about a 56-bit key, would probably cost several million dollarsto build a keysearch machine for.)    How many million dollars would the confidential phone messages ofthe GM headquarters be worth to Nissan, Chrysler, or Audi?  How abouthome phones of major execs and important engineers and designers?""Gee, Mr Jones, I understand you've had some financial problems lately.Maybe I can help...""     Indeed, if NSA really designed the algorithm to be secure, it's very likelyas secure as IDEA or 2-key DES.  However, the system as a whole isn't resistantto ""practical cryptanalysis.""  In _The Puzzle Palace_, Bamford describes howseveral NSA employees were turned by foreign (presumably KGB) agents, despitesecurity measures that I doubt any Big 8 accounting firm could match.

Liberty is never free, it is always purchased at some cost, almost always at the cost to another.  Whos liberty is more inalienable?Similarly for right of life.  When one person must die if he is to saveanother, or even a group of others, whos life is more inalienable?  That leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty, especially for serial killers.  Whos life and liberty is more valuable,the serial killer, or the victim?  According to that beautiful line,those two rights should be completely inviolate, that is, noone should beable to remove them.  This _includes_ government.  Admittedly the serialkiller has restricted some people's life and/or liberty, but is not hisown life/liberty inviolate also?  According to the declaration of independence,it is.Oooh, I like that.

"The company was probably ""Public Missiles, Inc"" of Michigan.Yup.Nope, it's not illegal. It is, however, closely regulated. In order to purchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to beone of the following:a) An employee of a government agency.b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets.c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved inresearch or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations: The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry.Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in constructionand flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are:- Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on thelocation, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL. - The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraftwithin the operating radius around the launch site.- Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited.- The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace thatunmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year)are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over thewestern deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popularsince it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members'use, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback isfrom 50 to 500 or more feet. By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an ""F"" motor are exempt frommost Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, SubpartC, for details.As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typicalrocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute,or multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carryeither a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launchesin the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.Camera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.Why not?

"My, this distinction seems quite arbitrary.  Blessed is the man whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sin is covered.  (Ps. 32:1).and quoted by the apostle Paul:  Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God  imputeth righteousness without works,  Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins  are covered.  Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.  (Rom. 4:6-8)The biblical perspective seems to be that foregiveness and covering areparallel/equivalent concepts in both testaments.  The dispensationaldistinction is unwarranted.I'm sure Rex has Scripture to back this up.  You're suggesting Jesus isgoing to travel around dealing with individual violations of His law -- formillions perhaps billions of people.  Such activity for Moses the lawgiverwas considered unwise (cf. Ex. 18:13ff).

"I would like to apologize for the typos in the previous post.In retrospect I would also like to quote another source: Douglas C.Haldeman from his 1991 book _Homosexuality_THERAPY INEFFECTIVERecently the founders of yet another prominent ""ex-gay"" ministry, ExodusInternational, denounced their conversion therapy procedures as ineffective.Michael Busse and Gary Cooper, cofounders of Exodus International and loversfor 13 years, were involved with the organization from 1976 to 1979.  Theprogram was described by these men as ""ineffective . . . not one person washealed.""  They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominentfeelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many weredriven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed ""reparative therapy.""The previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE, June30, 1992 called ""The Ex-Ex-Gay"" by Robert Pela.Some personal thoughts:It is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a majorportion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority amongits ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only allthey required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, tosave their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Evenlater, the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression andsegragation of African-Americans, even to the justification of lynchings.Today's scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool isstill coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mindcontrol, convincing people that they should see themselves as less thanGod sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is feltthier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure, no one is ""physically"" forcedto stay in this ""reparative therapy"" but sheer social pressure is enough formany to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.As an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecutionagainst gays in all facets of civil life.  A person should be judged bythe contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live,not by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven';ta clue what is in their heart.For those who seek more information about Gays and groups that accept themplease contact your nearest chapter of PFLAG (Parents & Friends of LesbiansAnd Gays) who will be more than happy to assist you.

I can't: see it having trouble keeping up.  His pcplus for dos works great,re: What to do after the high speed modem arrives.       Edition 01 Apr 93This article applies only to Windows 3.0 and 3.1, and not to NT, OS/2or DOS apps not running under Windows.One of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is thattheir RS-232C (serial, COM) performance is seriously deficient.  Almosteveryone who purchases a high-speed modem (V.32bis, V.32, PEP or HST)discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or acceptan incoming FAX (at 9600+) after upgrading the modem.  Overrun and retryerrors abound, even when the only active application is the datacomm orFAX program.  If the transfer completes at all, it may take even longerthan with the old 2400bps modem.There are three reasons for the problem:1. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters (UARTs) used in most   PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with single-byte FIFO buffers.  If the   operating system/driver cannot read and flush each character at high   interrupt rates, the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and   the previous one is lost.  DOS, being a fairly single-minded   environment during datacomm, can usually keep up. Windows can't.2. Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS, and   interrupts often take longer to service.  Overruns are much more likely   than under DOS.  As soon as you report to your PC/modem vendor that you   are losing data, you may be advised that ""you need to upgrade to a   16550"". More likely, since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance   about this issue,  you'll get no useful advice at all.  Most of the   store-front and mail-order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve   my own problem had never heard the term ""16550"" and many didn't even   know what a UART was.3. Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs (and PS/2's do), or if you can upgrade   your mother/COM board or add a new COM board, you may STILL experience   errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers   don't take full advantage of the 16550.  Windows 3.1 is improved in this   regard over 3.0, but I still recommend a driver upgrade.  Applications   like ProComm+/Win (which is what I use) cannot get around this problem   by themselves.If you have a modem CARD, you may not have a problem, as the modem part ofthe card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART, and avoidoverrunning it; however, I wouldn't want to bet that the card designerswere that clever, and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modemcard.  Some modem cards don't even have conventional UARTs, but if theyare to work with standard Windows drivers, they need to simulate one.Use MSD.EXE (below) to see what the modem card is, or is pretending to be.The Hardware Situation.The UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250or Ns16450 chips (or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can't replacethem).  You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoftdiagnostic program \WINDOWS\MSD.EXE.  Be sure to run it in DOS *before*bringing up Windows.   The Windows serial API may prevent MSD fromaccurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt.The Ns16550 UART has separate 16-byte transmit and receive FIFOs withconfigurable trigger levels, and can run reliably at clock rates up to460,800 bps, although with current modem technology, there's no point inpushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps. The 16550 has shorted accesscycle times than the 16450 or 8250.  The 16550 also has DMA capability, butit is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this.  For more technical info,see National Semiconductor Application Note AN-491.So, what UART component do you have?Try to locate the UART on your mother board, multi-function I/O card, COMboard or ISA/MCA modem card.  If you can't find a socketed component withthe numbers ""8250"" or ""16450"", your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI,and you won't be able to perform a chip replacement.  If you can DISABLEyour VLSI COM ports (as I chose to do), you can at least add an aftermarketCOM board.If you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips, you can buy plug-inNs16550AFN or PC16C550CN (low power CMOS version) ICs from severalsuppliers typically for $9 to $15 each.  The ""N"" chip is the normal 40-pindual-in-line package.  Other styles are available, but avoid any Ns16550chips without the ""A"" (the 16C550C are presumably all OK).Early Ns chips have bugs, although National will reportedly exchange thoseof their own manufacture for free.  Clone chips are available from variousIC makers other than National.  The manual for the TurboCom drivers statessupport for the following (apparently equivalent) chips:National Semiconductor: 16550A, 16551, 16552Chips&Technology:       82C607Texas Instruments:      t16c550aSilicon Systems:        73M550VLSI                    16C550TurboCom warns about the pre-""A"" Ns16550 and Western Digital 16C550,says that problems have been reported with early IBM PS/2 55SX and 70systems (IBM reportedly will upgrade them).If you DON'T have socketed 8250/16450 chips, you'll need to buy an after-market COM or multi-function board. If this is a modem card situation, youmay be hosed. To add a new COM or multi-function card, you'll need toeither disable the COM1/2 port(s) you are replacing, or re-assign them toCOM3/4 (although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom).Although cheaper cards are available, in the interest of getting theproblem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit TechnologyMCT-AIO+ card from:JDR Microdevices2233 Samaritan DriveSan Jose  CA  95124(800) 538-5000 voice US(408) 559-1200 voice other(800) 538-5005 FAX USThe MCT-AIO+ (and the ""+"" is important) sells for $89.95.

I only needed two serial ports,and am running out of IRQs on my PC, so I disabled my built-in VLSI-based8250 ports. However, with the TurboCom driver (below), I could have setthe internals as COM3 and 4, using IRQ sharing.The Software SituationSimply upgrading to 16550 UARTs will not completely solve common overrunproblems.  The standard MS serial drivers don't take full advantage of the16550. The Windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable, and the Windows 3.1drivers have the following limitations: - They enable only the receive FIFO, and only at rates above 2400 bps. - They never enable the transmit FIFO, which  results in an interrupt   rate of 10x during uploads. - They set the trigger level at 14 bytes (too high - it's easy for 2   more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO). - The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200.   With a V.32bis modem,  sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1   or more, suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57,600 bps would   be effective. - The API won't accept rates above ""CBR_128000"". - The API won't let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there, and even   if it did, DOS programs that aren't 16550-aware get little benefit   from a 16550 port with the standard drivers. - They don't allow IRQ sharing for COM3,4. - The BIOS doesn't initialize COM3,4 properly in many systems. - Windows provides no workaround for apps that don't provide port   speed options above 19200 bps.These problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 6.0, and mayor may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 3.1 (but before 4.0).Rumors suggest they ""may"" be solved in Windows ""4.0"".You can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buyinga copy of ""TurboCom"", current version 1.2, from:Bio-Engineering ResearchPacific CommWare Division180 Beacon Hill LaneAshland  OR   97520-9701(503) 482-2744 voice(503) 482-2627 FAX(503) 482-2633 BBSMCImail:    344-5374CompuServe: 71521,760Price was around $50 as I recall.  Bio-Eng is not set up to accept creditcards, so I had to send a check.  Egghead and 1-800-Software list TurboCombut as far as I know, they don't stock it.  Bio is not a software companyper se.  They apparently needed reliable hi-speed serial connections foran in-house instrument application, wrote their own driver, discovered amarket for it, revised it to be a general purpose COM driver suite. Theyrecently upgraded it for Windows 3.1.  It is run-time licensed.I now have my host (DTE) connect rate set to 57,600 bps most of  mydatacomm apps, and I am having ZERO problems with downloads. I routinelysee transfer rates that exceed 2,000 bps. I am also using 115,200 bpswhen linking an HP95LX to my PC, with lossless bi-directional I/O.Uploads to various remote systems are another matter, because many hostsare still using antique UARTs and drivers.Note that 19200 is still the highest rate that the Windows 3.1 Port menuin Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM port.  TurboCom getsaround this by allowing you to specify, on each port, a factor that willset the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through theWindows APIs and dialog boxes.I also have CTS/RTS hardware flow control enabled, and I suggest that youdo the same.  Even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ASCII data, Xon/XOff isnot a sufficiently reliable method of flow control.  The informal (DEC)standard for Xon/Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another16 (yes, sixteen) bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receivingsystem or device.  The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enoughto let us rely exclusively on Xon/Xoff.  A well-respected datacommengineer has informed me that the 16550's can't really do CTS/RTS allby itself in the DOS/Windows environment, so using data rates above115,200 may still be risky.Even with hardware flow control, a 16550 with TurboCom can stillexperience overruns in very busy systems, with lots of apps running andserious swapping in progress. If this is your situation, you may need tobuy a co-processed COM board, but this will cost you more than a16550/TurboCom upgrade.  A review of two such boards, and a review ofTurboCom, can be found in the Feb'93 issue of ""Windows Sources"" magazine.I suggest trying a 16550/TurboCom upgrade first, and experiment withprocess priorities and time slices if you are a ""power user"" whosethrashing system still runs into comm problems.Closing Soapbox CommentsThe state of RS-232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment acrossthe computer industry.  Because it is the oldest standard I/O interface,the job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to beassigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computercompanies.  The design of the average serial port is at least ten yearsbehind the state of the art. In my last job, with a major workstationvendor, I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing theinitial designs of a new system.  That family of machines wassubsequently introduced with 16550 ports.  However, this is theexception.  Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decentI/O.You may as well learn what you can about serial I/O, because thissituation shows no sign of improving soon.  When V.FAST arrives, I expectcries of outrage from Windows users world-wide whose 8250 PCs ""sort of""work today with V.32, but will fail miserably with V.FAST.  Without ahardware-buffered UART (like the 16550) and without software drivers thatuse that UART to best advantage, a V.FAST modem will be a waste of money.Regards,                                          1001-A East Harmony RoadBob Niland                                        Suite 503Internet:  rjn@csn.org                            Fort Collins CO 80525CompuServe: 71044,2124                            (303) 223-5209                     Copyright 1993 Robert J.

"A ""new Christian"" wrote that he was new to the faith and learning about it ""by reading the Bible, of course"". I am notat all sure this is the best path to follow.	While the Bible is, for Christians, the word of God, the revelation of God is Jesus Christ and the chief legacy of thisrevalation is the Church. I am not recommending any onedenommination, but I do recommend finding a comfortable christiancongregation in which to develop your faith, rather than justreading the Bible.	This does not mean that the Bible should not be read, althoughI would stick to the Gospels, epistles, and Psalms and avoid theBook of Revelation altogether [until you are with friends you arecomfortable with]. I am sure that mistakenly fervent  projects toread the entire Bible have frequently bogged down with a remarkablelack of fervour somewhere in the middle of Leviticus, or for the reallysturdy, somewhere in Chronicles.	The point is that the Bible is their to illustrate the Faithof Christians, but does not provide the totality of that faith. Vitalbeliefs of virtually all Christians are simply not mentioned -the Trinity, the duality of natures in Christ, types of Churchorganization. All these beliefs and practices have developed from thelived experience of the Christian people, an experience lived onehopes in the Spirit. As such the Bible, I think, is better studiesin the context of a congregation, and the context of other reading.	Following up on a suggestion of an old confessor of mine, I would even suggest that a good novel is a good way to reflect on thechristian life. [Most novels of any profundity are actually discussingthe nature of good and evil in the human heart]. My own induction intothe christian faith was brought about [after grace] through readingGraham Greene: _The Power and the Glory_ and the poetry of GerardManley Hopkins. I would also recommend Graham Greene's _MonsignorQuixote_ and any novel by Iris Murdoch. The last is not even a Christian,but such is her insistence on the need for the good life, that, frankly,I often am more uplifted and God directed after reading her than afterreading many parts of the Bible. And that after all is what beinga Christian is all about: letting your soul and your life be, insome way, directed towards the infinite, represented to us bythe person of Jesus Christ.",7
"I agree with Carol here.  Determining absolutes is, practically speaking, awaste of time.  And we easily forget that relative truth is, in fact relative.For example, I recently was asking some children the question ""What temperaturedoes water boil at?""  I got the answer 212 degrees consistently.  I askedif they knew what scale, and was told ""It's just 212 degrees.  Any scale.That's what all thermometers say.""  Well, that's sincere, and may betrue in the experience of the speaker, but it is simply wrong.  IT is NOTan absolute truth.  Similarly, Scripture is full of Truth, which we shouldnurture and cherish, but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truthand which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the timeand culture in which the text was penned is missing the point.  Then religioneasily becomes an intellectual head-trip, devoid of the living experience of the indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism, IMO. [example of head-covering in Church deleted]This was a good example.  There may be an Absolute Truth behind thewriting, but the simplest understanding of the passage is that theinstructions apply to the Corinthians, and not necessarily elsewhere.The instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of firstcentury culture and the particular climate at Corinth, which was havinga LOT of trouble with order. Is it Absolute Truth to me?  No.  And I see no compelling, or even reasonable, reason that it should be. Even the most die-hard literalists do not take all of the Bible literally.I've yet to meet anyone who takes the verse ""blessed is he who takes yourbabies and smashes their heads against the rocks"" literally.  The Biblewas not printed or handed to us by God with color codings to tell uswhat parts should be interpreted which way.  I agree.  Very few.  And even if we knew them, personally, we may not be able to express that in a way that still conveys Absolute Truth to another.The presence of absence of Absolutes may not make any difference, since Iknow I can never fully apprehend an Absolute if it walks up and greets me.I can't prove the existence of absolutes.  I can only rely upon MY experience.I also trust God's revelation that WE cannot fully comprehend the infinite.Therefore we can't comprehend the Absolutes.  So I don't need them.  I can never know the essence of God, only the energies by and through whichGod is manifested to God's creation.  So the reality can be that there AREabsolutes, but it is of no practical importance.  It's like claiming that theoriginal scriptural autographs were perfect, but copies may not be.  Swell.Who cares?  It doesn't affect me in any practical useful way.  I might as well believe that God has made a lot of electric blue chickens, and that theylive on Mars.  Maybe God did.  So what? Is that going to have ANY effect on how I deal with my neighbor, or God?  Whether or not I go to this or thatcafeteria for lunch?  No.  This attitude leads many non-Christians to believe that ALL Christiansare arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning.  Christianity is true,wonderful and sensible.  It appeals to Reason, since Reason is an innerreflection of the Logos of God.  Explanations that violate that simplyappear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world.NOTE:  I'm NOT claiming there is no place for authority. That'd be silly.       There IS a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian.       Authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others.       Authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that,       and is generally agressive.  Good parents (like God) are authoritative.       Many Christians are simply authoritarian, and, not surprisingly, few        adults respond to this treatment.Larry Overacker (llo@shell.com)--",7

"Hi there,I'm having a bizarre video problem within Windows 3.1.  I have a 286 witha GVGA-16 video board.  I've been using the standard Windows VGA driverwith other similarly configured computers.I am thinking that my problem is with the way Windows refreshes it's screen.The problem is that once Windows has been envoked, the colors startchanging themselves.  At first I thought it was hardware, but if you opena full screen DOS program from within the Windows session, you don't haveany problems until you get back to Windows - however, when you initiallyreturn to Windows, the original colors get refreshed properly.Also, it is not a uniform color change - so if you are in solitaire, thedesign on the back of the card maintains it's original color scheme, butthe white fronts of the cards will turn grey, then blue, etc.The color changes keep getting darker until finally everything is a darkpurple-ish black.  If you pop out to DOS and exit back to Windows - thescreen gets refreshed again.If I don't log into Windows and just do DOS things from the Novellnetwork, everything is fine.I originally loaded the software by bouncing it down to the net from theother machine I had just finished configuring, then from the net to thismachine.  When I ran into problems, I deleted everything on this machineand the net, and tried bouncing it again.  When that didn't work, I triedreloading Windows to no avail.Any thoughts on things to check out?  I am totally baffled!Thanks in advance for any assistance and instruction!",12

"I just hooked up my Mac IIsi to a relatively old (1 year?) Asante EN/SCadapter. The 10Base-T connection works like a charm. I installed thenewest drivers from Asante's ftp server.The problem begins when I attach one more device to the SCSI chain -specifically a 50MB drive. I power up the drive, then the Mac. The Mactests memory, etc. Just before the ""happy Mac face"" normally shows up, thepower light on the EN/SC goes out, and the boot process stops. So I can usethe network, or the external drive, but not both at once. This makes theAsante box pretty much unusable.It doesn't look like a purely electrical SCSI problem, because if I turnon the drive just a second or so too late, so that it doesn't get noticedduring the initial SCSI polling, the Mac boots normally and the adapterworks, even though the hard disk is powered on and connected. The Mac has*never* once failed to boot from its internal drive up to now (and I've hadit for over a year).Here is what I tried: changing the SCSI ID's of the EN/SC and the disk --several permutations; changing the order of devices, i.e. the EN/SC at thehead or tail of the chain; overterminating with an external terminator(both devices have internal ones); underterminating, i.e. removing internalresistors from the hard disk; trying another EN/SC box; trying anotheridentical drive; trying several different SCSI cables.Has anybody seen this?

"No. The issue is reducing crime, not guns. If gun control doesn'tlower crime overall, then is doesn't address the issue.Does that matter if assaults with a baseball bat become muchmore common? Muggers using a gun rely primarily on thethreat of the gun, and rarely shoot their victim. A muggerusing a knife is much more likely to start by stabbing his victim in an effort incapacitate him. So, while a knif may notbe as deadly as a gun, criminals are more likely to actually_use_ the knife (as opposed to threatening the victim with it.)It isn't at all clear that replacing the criminal's gun with aknife would reduce murders. Stabbings might just become morecommon. That's why it is important to look at the overall(not the with-gun) homicide rate. It avoids the issue ofsubstitution, different criminal techinques of using differentweapons, etc... and measures what we want to prevent: Murders.""Face""? Possibly. However, facing knife-welding attackers isn'ttoo common: Stabbing without warning and by supprise is theusual tactic. Very few criminals shoot from cover: It attractsto much attention and they don't have a chance to go through yourpockets. Overall, I'd much rather be threatened with a gunthan actually stabbed with a knife.Actually, the exact same statement is true of guns: Training inunarmed self-defence will let you disarm an untrained gunman without much problem.You also ignore the criminal's reaction: The National CrimeSurvey clearly shows that criminals (unarmed, armed with aknife, gun or whatever) are unwilling to risk their livesin a confrontation. If faced with a serious threat, almostall prefer to leave and find an easier target. Therefore,using (or threatening to use, as is much more commonly the case)a weapon _is_ the best defence against an attacker, regardlessof how he is armed. Knives, however, are much less effectivethan guns: Criminals don't consider knifes as a ""serious threat""nearly as often as they do guns.",8

CRITZ, III"" <71611.365@CompuServe.COM>Subject: EnviroLeague""Birth Announcement"" on March 7, 1993, from EARTH Forum, CompuServe                       Information Service===================================================================                      FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT                     -------------------                                      (SM)                        EnviroLeague A new youth movement,""EnviroLeague,"" was recently born, according to itsfounder, Boyd R. Critz, III (CIS ID# 71611,365), of Peoria, Illinois.EnviroLeague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, inmatters concerning their values related to and responsibility for ourenvironment. Incorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, its Articles andinitial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According toCritz, its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission andObjectives:                            MISSION    It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members   to foster and implement the improved education of young   people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards   of The Earth, to leave The Earth in a better condition   than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,   moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue   the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall   seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the   separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,   improvement, and responsible use of the environment in   which we must all live.                          OBJECTIVES    In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary   objectives shall be:       (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many            environmentally concerned organizations as            possible, said Movement having as its primary            focus the education and participatory            involvement of young people in appropriate areas            of environmental concern;       (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and            their branches a full complement of program            materials for their use, including suitable            uniforms, insignia and other badges, written            ideas, syllabi and information, literature and            other items as shall seem appropriate and            desirable;       (3)  To serve as a ""clearing house"" for the exchange            of program ideas, materials and information            among said organizations;  and       (4)  To assist environmentally concerned            organizations to recruit and train the necessary            adult leadership for their youth programs. EnviroLeague will operate through three ""Program Divisions"" serving youth inthe elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall bethrough formation of ""EnviroLeague Teams,"" either by EnviroLeague itself or byenvironmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing acharter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague. EnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leadersof each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles tomembership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improperconduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certainadditional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should suchorganizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon aspossible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as toyouth membership. EnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much tocontribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of itsTeams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing anylocal administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may beinvolved in similar functions at the national level. Program materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the ""draft""portions of the Mentor's Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in theEARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takesplace. CompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague's founder chose thiselectronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation.This announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTHForums. The electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe's Earth Forum - GOEARTH - message and library areas 17, both named ""EnviroLeague.""============================================================================ Subsequently, EnviroLeague's Initial Governance Council has held its firstmeeting.  Boyd Critz was elected as the first EnviroLeague Chief Guardian(equivalent to Chairman of the Board or CEO).  He can be reached at home(309) 675-4483 in case of real need.

"Here is the MacWeek article describing the DUO ram situation.(w/o permission.  I hope that is ok)JoseBad RAM brings some Duos down. (random access memory boards for AppleMacintosh PowerBook Duos) MacWEEK v7, n7 (Feb 15, 1993):132.COPYRIGHT Coastal Associates Publishing L.P. 1993By Raines Cohen     Austin, Texas - Some third-party memory-expansion cards for PowerBookDuos depart from Apple specs in ways that could cause crashes, data lossand other problems.     Technology Works Inc., a RAM and network vendor based here, last weekissued a warning about three problems it said it had found in Duo RAMproducts from some competing vendors, which it declined to identify.Other vendors and an Apple spokeswoman confirmed that the problems exist.     > Self-refresh.  The Duos require a kind of dynamic RAM calledselfrefreshing, which can recharge itself while the system sleeps.  ButTechnology Works said some vendors have sold Duo cards withnonselfrefreshing DRAM, which can cause the system to lose data or fail towake from sleep.     Most leading memory manufacturers include the letter V in the partnumber stamped on their self-refreshing chips; nonself-refreshing chipsinstead have an L, according to TechWorks.  The chip label, however, maynot tell the whole story.  Newer Technology of Wichita, Kan., said it usesnonself-refreshing chips but adds its own circuitry to keep them refreshedwhile the Duo sleeps.     > Speed.  Some RAM-card vendors have put 80-nanosecond DRAM on Duocards rather than the 70-nanosecond type the 230 requires, TechnologyWorks said.  However, some chips labeled as 80- or 85-nanosecond arecertified by the manufacturer to run at a higher speed.     Kingston Technology Corp. of Fountain Valley, Calif., said it offersDuo RAM cards with 80-nanosecond chips, but only for the Duo 210, which iscompatible with the slower chips.     > Space.  Technology Works charged and Apple officials confirmed thatsome third-party cards are too large to fit properly, forcing the cornerof the Duo keyboard up and preventing the system from starting up normallywhen in a Duo Dock.",14
"I am using DOS Quick C 2.5 in a DOS window under Windows 3.1, and the otherday while I was running the compiler, I got a general protection faultimmediately followed by a ""serious disk error"".

"I hope I didn't award custody, Rich.  I purposely used ""handle"" in order to avoid doing so - i.e., that happens to be what religions do (of course there areaberrations like ""scientific"" creationism).  I used ""best"" in part to indicate that science currently has a time of it with why and who, so these domains aremostly ignored.  I also attempted to be brief, which no doubt confused thematter.  As an aside, for science I should have written ""how and when"".  Nobodyseems to argue over what.Seems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual.  I'm nottrying to be evasive on this, but from a societal perspective, religion works.On the other hand, sometimes it is abused and misused, and many suffer, whichyou know.  But the net result seems positive, this from the anthropologicalperspective on human affairs.  You might call me a neo-Fruedian insofar as I think the masses can't get along without religion.  Not that generally they are incapable; they just don't, and for myriad reasons, but the main one seems to be the promise of immortality.  Very seductive, that immortality.  Therefore it seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for dispensing answers to ""who and why"".  I suggest that this holds regardless of the ""truth"" in their answers to who and why simply because people believe.  In the end, spiritual beliefs are just as ""real"" as scientific facts and explanation (CAUTION TO SOME: DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT).  No.  In fact, I don't think it is closed now, at least for some individuals. Isn't there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was created from nothing in a Big Bang singularity?  This approach might presuppose an absence of who and why, except that it seems it could be argued that something had to be responsible for nothing?  Maybe that something doesn'thave to be supernatural, maybe just mechanistic.  But that's a tough one forpeople today to grasp.  In any case, theory without empirical data is not explanation, but then your question does not require data.  In other words, I agree that theorizing (within scientific parameters) is just as scientific as explaining.  So the answer is, who and why are not closed to scientists, but I sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate.  Data will be necessary for improvement, and that seems a long way off, if ever.  Pretty convoluted here; I hope I've made sense.  I agree generally.  But I prefer to put it this way - the *questions* of how, when, who and why were not open to inquiry.  During the Enlightenment, reason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when, and not, for the most part, who and why.  Science was thus born out of the naturalists' curiosity, eventually carting away the how and when while largely leaving behind the who and why.  The ignorant, the selfish, the intolerant, andthe arrogant, of course, still claim authority in all four domains.Much obliged.  Funny how facts tend to muddle things, isn't it?  Well, I amsure there are plenty of ""scientific"" creationist ""rebuttals"" out there somewhere, even if they have to be created from nothing.[just for the record, again, AMH = anatomically modern humans] Best regards :-),",11

"As promised, I spoke today with the company mentioned in a WashingtonTimes article about the Clipper chip announcement. The name of the companyis Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the endof this message on how to contact them).   Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons thatwe are. More specifically however, Mr. Bryen of Secure Communicationsbrought to light many points that might interest most of the readers.   His belief is that AT&T was made known of the clipper well before therest of the industry. This is for several reasons, several of which are: - A company of AT&T's size could never be able to make a decision to use   the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced. - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT&T's secure telephone   devices. AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all.   This stuck them as strange, until now...   Also I spoke with Art Melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed severalconcerns over the new Clipper Chip:  - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.  - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto    system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency    of the government.  - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm    is vulnerable over time to an attacker.  - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that    it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or    changing the keys themselves.  - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and    money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed    engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very    difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique    to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is    hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.Additonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn't tellme much about their new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet.However he told me a little: - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been   granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is   secure. - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm.   The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret   until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate   the following:    - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but      Mr. Melnick stated ""Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out."")    - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES.    - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA).    - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that      it is _adujustable_ and is ""More than adequate for security.""    - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and      can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which      is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I      consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use.    - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques      such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the      hardware chip.    - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars      for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced      enough, which probably won't happen]).    - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm      and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted      data into ""blocks."" This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know      what the block header is. This program operates at all supported      RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm.    - Most importantly: IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!!Right now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them outof business. This is a very real possibility. So they really need help instopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard.

"Looking at [1] we find that during Roman times ""Tyre vied with Sidonfor first place in the intellectual life of the period""; that Tyre wasthe seat of a Christian bishop, eventually with 14 dioceses under it;that ""the most magnificent church of its kind in all Phoenecia"" was thebasilica built in Tyre ca. 314; that Tyre was well known for itsexports of glassware, wine, white marble, and dyed cloth; that Tyre,along with other seaports, ""provided outlets for South Arabian, Indianand even Chinese trade""; that Tyre had to accomodate its growingpopulation by ""following a perpendicular, rather than horizontal, lineof growth"" (because it was running out of land to build on); that Tyreestablished colonies of its own.  None of this sounds like a ""smallfishing village"" by any stretch of the imagination.Centuries later, under the Abbasids, Tyre had ""opulent and flourishingbazaars"" and buildings of 5-6 stories.  During this period, Tyre was""noted for its export of sugar, beads, and, as of old, glassware.""During the Crusades, Tyre was the second-most flourishing city heldby Franks.  (There is a lot more, but I got tired of writing.)In [2] we read the following description of modern Lebanon: ""other*major cities* in Lebanon include Tripoli, Sidon, Tyre, Baalbek andZahlah.""  [my emphasis]  This source also discusses the impact ofthe Lebanese Civil War, and the Israeli military actions (1978, 1982)on the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon.  It notes that after Israel'swithdrawel in 1984, ""Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its localeconomy.""If Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present,why is it always called a city (or, above, a ""major city"")?  Whydoes it show up on all the maps?   When population figures for citiesin Lebanon are given, why is Tyre always one of the cities on thelist (even if the list is only a dozen cities long)?[1] Philip K. Hitti, _Lebanon in History: From the earliest times tothe present_, NY, St. Martins, 1967.  [2] Federal Research Division, Library of Congress, _Lebanon: acountry study_, edited by Thomas Collelo, 1989.A one-horse town?  Sounds like a lot of work for one horse.(Anyway, Tyre is connected by roads to the mainland.  Theymay even use cars these days. :-) The 1991 Encyclopedia Britannica says ""Pop. (1982 est.) 23,000.""  Most other references give figures in the 14-17 thousand range.(One atlas gives the population of Tyre as 60,000; the samesource give comparatively high figures for Sidon and Beirut, also,so I doubt that it is a typo.  Perhaps these were figures forthe cities and their surrounding areas.)  I don't doubt that thepopulation of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades.  Inparticular, the 1982 Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit.   I thought you were talking about times that Tyre was destroyed.Don't most, if not all, of these apply not just to Tyre but to the other cities in the area?  Sidon, for example?  Can you makea case for Tyre having been singled out?They had a good deal of autonomy under the Seleucids. From [2]:Tyre ""receiv[ed] the rights [of autonomy] from Antiochus Ephiphanesand from 125 BC onward enjoy[ed] complete autonomy.

"Archive-name: space/scheduleLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:23 $SPACE SHUTTLE ANSWERS, LAUNCH SCHEDULES, TV COVERAGE    SHUTTLE LAUNCHINGS AND LANDINGS; SCHEDULES AND HOW TO SEE THEM    Shuttle operations are discussed in the Usenet group sci.space.shuttle,    and Ken Hollis (gandalf@pro-electric.cts.com) posts a compressed version    of the shuttle manifest (launch dates and other information)    periodically there. The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE    archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest. The portion of his manifest formerly    included in this FAQ has been removed; please refer to his posting or    the archived copy. For the most up to date information on upcoming    missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.    Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news    frequently.    WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?    The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks    (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).    The ""Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,"" ASC G&C 2102,	""During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is	commanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower	clearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)	orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a	negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other	advantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort	maneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of	the horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining	downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target	in second stage.""    This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try    to interpret.    1)	We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.    2)	Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack	between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the	""relative wind"") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line	between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly	negative angle (""a negative q-alpha"").	This causes a little bit of	""downward"" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z	direction) and this force ""alleviates structural loading.""	We have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the	most ""delicate"" part of the vehicle.    3)	The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more	mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or	to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be	the case if we didn't roll (""performance gain"").    4)	The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated	flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort	maneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (""decreased abort maneuver	complexity"").    5)	The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio	antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio	antennae on the Orbiter (""improved S-band look angles"").    6)	The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a	helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.    7)	The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is	more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east	(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity	in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:	velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.	The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its	velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.    This all begs the question, ""Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to    achieve that attitude?""  The answer is that the pads were leftovers    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the ""top""    [Orbiter side] and the ""bottom"" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the    Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle    guy.)    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.	He added that the ""roll    maneuver"" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total    maneuver is really expressed as a ""quaternion,"" a grad-level-math    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element    array.    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite    for these viewers.    If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.    It's worth asking if yours doesn't.    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions    are not being covered.

"I had the same question for my 55lb NEC 5FG monitor. The Apple guy said thattheir 50lb 16"" monitor is OK to put ontop of the Centris and had no comentbeyond that. I was going to just put the NEC on the box but then I got to thinking - the monitor has a small tilt/swivel base so maybe the weightwould be more concentrated than with Apple's (I don't know the area of the base of their tilt/swivel). Additionally, the CDROM drive is in the middle.So I cut a piece of 3/8"" thick wood to about 16.25"" x 12"", covered it in a cream covered cloth, and used it as a buffer layer between the Centris's topand the monitor!!Mick Mueck  mick.mueck@analog.com",14

"I became aware of the claim years ago.  So I decided to check it out, on myown.  But, then, that was in BN times (Before Net).  So, here are some references.  See Robin Lane Fox's _The unauthorized version_, (p.284) where Lane Fox writes, ""... the one passage which appears to [comment on Jesus' career] is agreed to be a Christian addition.""In my Re:Albert Sabin response (C5u7sJ.391@sunfish.usd.edu) to Jim Lippard (21April 93), I noted that consensus is typically indicated subtly as in Elaine Pagel's _The gnostic gospels_ (p.85), to wit:  ""A comment *attributed* toJosephus reports ... [emphasis mine]"".  Scholars sometimes do not even mentionthe two Josephus entries, another subtlety reflecting consensus.So far as I can deduce, today's consensus is built on at least three things: 1) the long passage is way out of context, 2) Origen did not know about thelong passage, and 3) the short and long passages are contradictory. I don't know the references wherein the arguments which led to consensus areorginally developed (does anyone?).Biblical scholars as I defined them include theologians and historians.  Theformer, like the latter, incorporate historical, social, technological andideological contexts as well as theology.  So the distinction is blurred.  I didn't elaborate on that.  Sorry.  (In turn, historians are compelled toincorporate theology).Can't say about the number of copies.  These were, however, BG times (Before Gutenburg).  A hundred first editions seems exceedingly high; counting on one hand seems more reasonable.  Perhaps those mss. without the long insert (if any,because anything is possible) have been destroyed.  Such a practice is certainly not foreign to religions.  Anyway, all we have are mss. which have the two entries.  Lippart (in the message noted above) talks about an Arabic ms.  But here the ms. date is critical.:-)",11

"Even though I find this to be funny on the surface, the original poster of thejoke has  tried and convicted the members of the BD to be a bunch of ""nuts"".This may be a dangerous thing to do.  It is my opinion that most educatedor well informed people of this country have some distrust of the government.This should exist because as a bureaucracy, any government given enough timewill tend to exist for it self and not for the original purpose it was created for.  This distrust by the people should keep those in power in-line.That and a properly functioning press.  When a sensationalism oriented pressportrays a group of people as ""nuts"" or crazies, a violation of thosepeople's civil rights seem justified.   Since we, as American's, have the gurantee of rights as enumerated in the constitution, to include the2nd ammendment, the government must appease the public's opinion or risk voted out of existance, or if it has become corrupt enough to tamper withdomocratic process itself, being thrown out by force.  Our government as it stands, must appease the public.  Therefore the official press releases portray the BD's as fanatics who are a threat topublic safety.  We must not prejudge people based on one sided information.So far the only information that we are being given is comming from the veryagency that was embarrased by the BD(Branch Davidians sp?).  It is to theiradvantage to make the BD's as fanatical and dangerous as possible.  If theywere portrayed as law-abiding citizen's, then they(ATF) had no justificationwhat so ever of doing what they did.   So let's keep an open mind.  Jokes like above, even though it may be funny,may mislead the public from the truth of the matter.Just as an aside,  my understanding of U.S. vs Rock Island and U.S. vs Daltonleads me to believe that the National Firearms Act, which allows the Fed's(in this case ATF) to regulate firearms(machine guns), has been deemed to beunconstitutional since 1986.(By two federal district courts at least).And since, I believe the only reason ATF was involvedin this case is because of firearms violations, it would be interesting to find out whether or not the search warrent was based on the NFA.It would be very embarrassing indeed if a search warrent based on a possiblyunconstitutional law has resulted in 4 deaths(Law enforcement). ****************************************************************************The above opinions are mine and mine only.I'm solely responsible for my opinions and my actions.

If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on > theevidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from any >possibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond the >rather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphere > isnot self explanatory). So your are saying to rely on our feelings and experiences (sincethis is the only other source of information left to us).How can you then convince somebody that your ""feelings and experiences""are the correct ones then if you can't show somebody visible andmeasurable effects?  If my experiences say that ""there exists no god""and yours says there does, where does that leave us?  Since we are onlygoing on experiences, then both of us are correct within our own personalrealities.Furthermore, the trouble with ""feelings and experiences"" is that theycan lead you astray, as the tragic outcome of Waco illustrates.  Iam sure that many of Koresh's followers really believed in him butI think that you and I will agree that they were being misled.Finally, how on earth do you come to the conclusion that the physicalsphere is not self-explanatory when you only rely on the five senses?You must be using a definition of ""evidence"" that I am not familiar with.To me, evidence is something you can show others -unambiguously- thatwhat you are saying is true.However, I agree with you that belief in a diety is a matter of faith.It is not something you can share around - others must experience itindependantly.  Unfortunately, as I have explained above, this putsbelief down to a matter of experience.  My impression is that Christiansdo not have the monopoly on reason, evidence and faith as far as any ofthese things can go.At the risk of repeating my argument : As I have explained previously, the trouble is that Moslems, Buddhists, Jews, etc will ALL say that THEYclaim, with good reason, to be a valid system, possessed of the bestevidence, for explaining Gods revelations to man (for Buddhists itshould read ""for explaining the non-existence of God"").  So not onlymust you ""prove"" your own case, you have to ""disprove"" theirs.(alt.messianic is a good place to see people strong in the beliefof their own faiths ... and with their own good reasons)I know that ALL people can use reason ... I never claimed that they don't.I just wish to make sure that their arguments are well-founded.  It goeswithout saying that if I make a blunder that I expect people to correctme.  Once we have all gone through this process of removing the non-essential and contradictory bits, we should (hopefully) have madesome progress towards the truth.",7

"You should be ashamed to call yourself an Ulf Samuelson fan. Anybody who playsthe way he does, does not belong in the NHL.

"You misrepresent me, Selim.  The hard evidence for my statements abouthis lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book""Orientalism"" by Edward Said.  Edward Said, by the way, is a Christian,not a Muslim.Regarding Bernard Lewis:Him being a Zionist gives him a political motive for hisgiving misrepresentations and half-truths about Islam.Read ""Orientalism"" by Edward Said -- see the evidence for yourself.In fact, I may post some of it here (if it isn't too long).I haven't read Lewis's article, so I can't comment directly upon it, andhave only spoken about his writings _in general_ so far, that hispolitical motives make him a biased writer on Islam.  His anti-Islamicpolemics, as I understand it, are often quite subtle and are often basedon telling half-truths.Again, read ""Orientalism"" by Edward Said.  I am _not_ asking you to takewhat I say on trust, in fact I am urging you not to do so but to getthis book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for_yourself_.If slavery is _in reality_ (as opposed to in the practice of someMuslims) opposed by Islam, then using slaves for sexualpurposes is necessarily opposed too.I understand your point of view, Selim -- I think, rather, it is _us_who are not getting through to _you_.Some of the points you repeat above I have already answered before.Regarding women, I have made posting after posting on this subject,showing that Islam is not anti-woman, etc.  However, have you beencompletely ignoring my postings or just missing them?  I just reposted avery good one, under the title ""Islam and Women"", reposted fromsoc.religion.islam.  If this has already disappeared from your site,then please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of thisexcellent article.  IMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.Regarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made,which is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is basedcompletely on the Qur'an and contains numerous Qur'anic verses andhadiths to support its point of view.Our approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historicalstandpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur'anand hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and performa particular action, does that automatically mean that their action ispart of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur'an and Sunnah?  No!  Ofcourse not.Let me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this foryou.  The Qur'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says ""I am aMuslim"" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now meanthat Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, andonly an idiot would think so.Do you see my point?You are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is anideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximisetheir wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings.To say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --Islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to becapitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support afree-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of capitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)One can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it isbecause Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.Selim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you thefallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) thatIslam => lack of education and power.For a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For asignificant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost inthe sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education iscompletely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- historyshows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must beother reasons for this situation.Well, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extentof your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are notknowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims arefollowing the Qur'an or not.The Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at onestage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by ""following the Qur'an""that Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesisthat is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historicalfact which contradicts your theory. You have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.So far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education isquite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your viewsmakes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all ofthis.I think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.Here too.Selim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrateignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularlywith respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so Ithink).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!Selim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts thatyou are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and startthinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of ourpostings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviouslyhave.",0
"greetings:  you may be in luck.  i seem to recall seeing a blurb in one ofthe kit car magazines about a company in norway who pulled amould (sp?) off a real kubel, and has adapted it to the beetlefloorpan.  as for the suspension, all i can remember about thevw thing i used to own is that it had about 3"" more suspensiontravel than a stock beetle, but i'd heard that there were after-market parts for off-road use that were as good or better.  notethat the major difference (looks wise) between a kubel & a thingare the hood and the fenders.  the kubel had an external sparemounted *on* the hood, and the hood sloped down (for visibility?)sharply, and had rounded fenders.  the thing has a lightly sloped hood with the spare mounted inside (unless moved to make for moreluggage space...) and has half-hexagon shaped fenders (imagine anut large enough to put a tire *in*, and cut off the bottom halfof it...).  unfortunately, i don't have that info anymore.  try stoppingat a local bookstore and copying down the phone numbers for thetwo big mag's and calling them.  they might be able to get thenumber for you (don't forget to calculate the time difference tonorway before calling...).later,kc",17

"The story I related is one of the seven apparitionsapproved by our Church as worthy of belief.  It happenedin La Salle, France.The moral lesson of the story is:The Lamb of God has been sacrificed and His blood has been used to cleanse us of our sins every moment as God perceivesworthy of being done in Heaven.  Mary weeps for The Lamb andfor the rest of her offsprings.  This will continue while we disobey God or sin against Him.  Mary, as a messenger, has been given the task to make us be 'aware' of the evilserpent (communism, wars, famine, unfaithful, disobedienceto God, etc.) running after the rest of her offsprings.   The children who went astray by disobedience led by the dragon is brought back by her peace and loving messages, reparations for sins, to obey God's commandments and be more worthy to be in the presence of The Lamb.As she was conceived without sin to be worthy of bearing theSon of God in her womb, Mary has been preparing us, the Church,the Body of Christ, for His second coming (making sure we are protected from the dragon).  Also, she has been preparing the new Eden, by reversing the deed of the ancient Eve.  The new Eden will bethe sanctuary of the righteous as judged by Christ in Hisnext coming.    I relate the story again:    I believe this and Mary, in one of her apparitions      in 19th or 20th century, she appeared to these          two children who tends goats and cows (I forgot         the exact place).  She was  weeping and telling the     children that she is afraid she's ""going to lose her    Son's arm"".  She is mourning too for these              townfolks because it was their fault that there         would be drought in their harvest; not much good        food again this year as it was last year.                                                                       Mary tells the children:                            *    Most of the townfolks in this place worked whole    **    week even on Sundays when they should be in church  **    honoring God.  These townfolks swears and           **    uses her Son's name in bad words.  That is          *    why her Son's arm is so heavy in pain.                  Then she asked them if they pray.  The children         said ""hardly"".  She asked them to pray every            morning and night.  When the children went back         from work they had to tell somebody about this.         When the news was spred and after thorough          *    investigation of the incident, the townfolks        **    were converted and faith and obedience to God       **    were restored in their community.                   *Once again, the Lamb succeeds.",7
"Wow, you guys are really going wild on this IDE vs. SCSI thing, and I thinkit's great!However, I think that some people (such as myself) would benefit from answersto the simple(?) question:  Which would YOU choose, and why?Like lots of people, I'd really like to increase my data transfer rate fromthe hard drive.  Right now I have a 15ms 210Mb IDE drive (Seagate 1239A), andwhat I would say is a standard (not special, no cache I believe) IDE controllercard on my ISA 486-50.I'm currently thinking about adding another HD, in the 300Mb to 500Mb range.And I'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a-grinding in my head)about buying a SCSI drive (SCSI for the future benefit).  I believe I'm gettingsomething like 890Kb/sec transfer right now (according to NU).How would thisnumber compare if I bought the state-of-the-art SCSI card for my ISA PC, andthe state-of-the-art SCSI hard drive (the wailing-est system I could hope for)?Obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other, but what wouldYOU want to use on your ISA system? And how much would it cost?Along those lines, what kind of transfer rate could I see with my IDE HD's if Iwere to buy the top-of-the-line IDE caching controller for my 200Mb, 15ms HD?And how much would it cost?I actually have a PAS-16, and could (what a waste I guess it would be...) hookup a SCSI HD through it's SCSI port which yields an optimum of 690Kb/sec.Actually, I have a borrowed 12ms Fujitsu HD hooked up through it now (andown the Trantor HD drivers for the PAS-16 SCSI port).

Indeed, allowthem freely to give advice on anything and they will fritter away one'swealth and disobey the wishes of the owner of this wealth.

It is easy to enjoy them, but they cause greatanxiety. The most virtious among them are libertines. But the mostcorrupt are whores. Only those of them whom age has deprived of anycharm are untainted by vice. They have three qualities particular tomiscreants; they complain of being oppressed, whereas it is theywho oppress; they make oaths, whereas they are lying; they pretendto refuse men's solicitations, whereas they desire them most ardently.Let us beg the help of God to emerge victorious from their evil deeds.And preserve us in any case from their good ones.""(Quote from Mas'ud al-Qanawi, ref.

Theyinclude the fact that the majority of the citizens are Israeli, thefact that Israel maintains religious freedom for all people, and thehistorical connection of Judaism to Jerusalem.	When Jerusalem was devided by a Jordanian invasion in 1948,the cease fire agreement included the right of individuals to visitreligious shrines.  This cease fire agreement was violated by Jordan,who did not allow Jews to visit holy sites under their control.  TheJordanians also bulldozed every synagoge in the city.  They turned aJewish cemetary into a hotel, and used the gravestones in theirlatrines.	Israel has allowed individuals of all religions intoJerusalem, protected holy sites, and demonstrated its fitness tocontrol the city.	Also, I should point out that Islam is not centered inJerusalem, but has holy sites there.  The home of Islam is Mecca,where all Muslims should make a pilgramage (the hajj).

"The willingness of the majority of the people to give up their freedom in exchange for a sense of safety is hardly limited to the USA, and is an endemic problem in any human society of any appreciable size.  The structure of the US government does try to combat this tendency to some extent, but fighting entropy is always a losing battle.  Most people would rather have comfort than freedom.  The paradox is that you can't really have the former, in the long term, unless you have the latter.One of the reasons that I probably come across to some people as a weird cross between a libertarian and an ""establishment tool"" is that I end up taking an utterly pragmatic view of government.  I don't get up in arms when the government fails to protect the interests of the people, because in my lifetime it never has--therefore, I have no expectation that it will.  As a result, I protect my own interests rather than expecting the government to be ""fair"".  I will use strong cryptography when I think it is needed, whether or not it is legal at the time.  Same thing with anything else the government would rather not see in private hands--that's their problem.  What's important to me is using the right tool for the job.  If it's legal, so much the better.  If it is not, but does not violate my (very strong) sense of personal ethics, I will use it anyway as long I think it is worth it.  Expecting the government to actually protect the interests of its citizens, except by accident, is utter folly.  Even Jefferson, one of the major architects of the American system of government, figured that in a couple hundred years it would become so corrupt and self-serving that it would be time dismantle it and try again, by revolution if necessary.  I agree, and while I don't go around trying to spark one, I'll certainly participate if it happens when I'm around.

"A listmember (D Andrew Killie, I think) wrote, in response to thesuggestion that genocide may sometimes be the will of God: > Any God who works that way is indescribably evil, > and unworthy of my worship or faith.Nobuya ""Higgy"" Higashiyama replied (as, in substance, did others): > Where is your source of moral standards by which you judge God's > behavior?It is often argued that we have no standing by which to judge God'sactions.  Who is the clay to talk back to the potter? But we find acontrary view in Scripture. When God proposes to destroy the city of + Suppose that there are some good men in the city. + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked? + Far be it from you, Lord, to do such a thing! + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?I am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, andcan perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as + Shame on you, Lord, if you do such a thing!There are those who say that the definition of ""good"" is ""whateverGod happens to want."" But if that is so, then the statement that Godis good has no meaning.  It simply says that God does what He wants.That being the case, no one can either love or obey God because Heis good. The only motive left for obeying Him is that He ispowerful. Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when hetells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if youdefy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makessense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if youdon't. This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction toGenesis 18 and to Christianity in general.Any theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes anyfurther discussion of morality (or of the goodness of God)meaningless. However, it does not follow that our moral judgementsare always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgementsin particular cases about the course of action most likely toachieve a good result.When I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God inhistory, those actions often seem to me very different from what Imight expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us.Moreover, leaving the Scriptures aside, and considering the naturalworld, I find that Nature is often very different from what I might""Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author ofthe Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sortof difficulties that they find in Nature."")Now, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself anargument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God.On the contrary, their ABSENCE would be such an argument. Supposethat I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess, and suppose that everytime he makes a move, I find myself nodding and saying: ""Good move!Just what I was expecting him to do.  Same move I would have made ifI were playing."" That would be a sign that Fisher is no better achess player than myself. Given that he is better, I expect that atleast some of his moves will have me thinking, ""Now, what do supposeinduced him to do that?"" or even, ""Boy, that was a real slip -- he'sjust thrown the game away!"" Similarly, if God understands theworkings of the universe better than I do, it is to be expected thatsometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake.One difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at thecontrols of the universe is that I can see the end of the chessgame. If Fisher wins, I revise my earlier inference that it wascarelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier.However, if he loses, and particularly if I can see that there was atime when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and didnot take it, then I know that he is not as good a player as I hadthought.With God, on the other hand, I shall not in this life see the totalresult of some of His actions. Therefore, my grounds for judgingthat I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakierthan my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher.     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****In the book of Genesis, we read that Joseph's ten older brothers,who (with good reason) found  him insufferable, conspired to sellhim into slavery in Egypt. There he eventually became Viceroy, andwhen there was a famine in Canaan, he was able to provide for hisfamily. When his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: ""Donot worry. You meant to do me evil, but God turned it into good.""        The history of the Jews is largely a history of events   that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued   survival of the religion, or the people, or both. But,   amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews   and of Judaism.        The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup   of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of   the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out   of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if   they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have   intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into   their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few   generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a   disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into   the Promised Land.        Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered   sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea,   destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of   the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would   be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not.   Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of   assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the   worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility   cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human   sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never   again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.   Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the   Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.        Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming   simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only   prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem   every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity,   with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place   of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the   Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in   danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea,   that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the   controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish   people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge   of all humans everywhere.        Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by   that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather   the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined   to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and   the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might   think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not.   The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah   portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage   from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss   that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of   Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)   were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it   had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would   probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism   saved them.        [Other examples here omitted for brevity's sake.]        Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became   famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR   LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it,   everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on   stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the   studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast   Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she   later realized that if she had played the screen role, she   would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type.   It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney   offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for   it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking   at Walt Disney, she said, ""And now, my special thanks to the   man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!"" It was the most   memorable line of the evening.        In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in   the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive   to this day, beginning with Joseph's brothers, and continuing   with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus   Epiphanes....After the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to himprivately and said, ""You were talking about the Holocaust, weren'tyou?"" He answered, ""If that is an example that came to your mind,then you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would nottalk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it."" I assumethat he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been nostate of Israel.Someone hearing the rabbi's lecture might leap to the conclusionthat God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish Hispurposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  goon to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God's doing -- that Hestirred up Joseph's brothers to a murderous hate against him, andthat when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaoh'sheart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go.And this raises questions about how an action can be consideredwicked and at the same time be considered something that God hasbrought about.I suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who hasa log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log,instead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knotthat spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considersthe wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features theknot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and colorof the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so thatobservers will say: ""How fortunate the sculptor was in finding apiece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Itspresence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue agreat work of art."" In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor waslooking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had notcontained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art,but a different one. So, if Joseph's brothers had not sold him, Godwould still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people,but He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had notbetrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejectedJesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, ifPilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had setJesus free, it might appear that there would have been noCrucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore noSalvation. Not so. God did not need Judas' sin to redeem us. IfJudas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciledthe world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not knowhow Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if itsinterior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, andjust as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourthgame agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishopsand had attacked Fisher's knight instead (don't bother to look upthe game in question--I am making up this example, but the point isnone the less valid).Thus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice ofPilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardicewas not God's doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted God'splans by behaving justly and courageously.What, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, ""Iwill harden Pharaoh's heart, so that he will not let the people go""?Some Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppetwith God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and crueltywere not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose ratherthat what God was telling Moses was something like this: ""If you seethat Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not bediscouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. Mypurposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you andlet the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit hisresistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that futurehistorians and theologians will suppose that I would have beenthrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me.""To return to the question that started this all off. Is it possiblethat the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, areinstruments of God's will?     First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as whatJoseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong.They intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, thatdoes not make them any less subject to just condemnation andpunishment.     Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But notthe same good that He would have brought if the Serbians hadrefrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does thegood He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.",7

I assume that it isreasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancyrate.The difference is not in ""contraceptive technology"" but in the values taughtto the children.

"Bill, I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider theJosephus reference to be an early Christian insert.  By biblical scholar I meanan expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let thechips fall where they may.  This excludes literalists, who may otherwise bedefined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They arenot trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).Why an insert?  Read it - I have, a number of times.  The passage is glaringlyout of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere in his work.  The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which it lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.Until you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong aboutthe Josephus insert, your ""proof"" is meaningless and it should not be repeatedhere.  What's more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would ""prove""nothing.  Scholars speak of the ""weight of evidence.""  Far more independentevidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, yourbelief is based on faith.  That's OK, but you exceed your rights when you passfaith off as fact.As for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaringinconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn't a perfect canon be perfect? Shouldn't there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel Fictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for Herb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share an evolutionary ancestry).The fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not denyyour position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels ""prove"" your faith. Independent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have alreadydiscussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith. Moreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attemptedto ""prove"" your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different thansaying ""I am right because I say so.""  Your logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian General Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where""fundamentalist"" came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1)Jesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodilyresurrected, 4) Jesus' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is theclincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe""inerrant"" broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take thefirst four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrantbible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to contain the first four.  Smoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!Its faith, Bill.  You don't have any more or better truths than anyone else. Whatever works for you.  Just don't foist it on others.

"The FLYERS closed out the season last night with their 8th straight victory,a 5-4 OT winner over the Hartford Whalers. The OT game winner came from DimitriYushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERSnever led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked anNHL record 9th OT loss this season.Roster move:Gord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGillInjuries:Ryan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched.Lines:Eklund-Lindros-RecchiBeranek-Brind'Amour-DineenLomakin-Butsayev-ConroyFaust-Acton-BrownGalley-BowenYushkevich-HawgoodCarkner-HynesDominic RousselGame Summary:I didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these partsI didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed bya few things I did pick up:First Period:	Hartford, Nylander 10, 8:51	Philadelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp)Penalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda,Har (interference) 18:43Second Period:	Hartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00	Philadelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09	Hartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38Penalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Harmajor-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski,Har (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50Third Period:	Hartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)	Philadelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11	Philadelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38Penalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30Overtime:	Philadelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15.Penalties - NonePower Play:	Philadelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4Goalies:	Philadelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)	Hartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)On the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blueline and Nylander stripped him and took off.The Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and itended up behind the goalie.On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in.This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and ifthey get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner,Galley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one ofthem was the closest FLYER to the play.That's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who itwas that scored, much less how.From what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hartasked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of thegame. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprisedthat a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy Soderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a seasonand, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.But here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi fornumber 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing betweenhim and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????What? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...#1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.The difference between the team's record with him and without him is noaccident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful withoutRecchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with EricLindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jerseynext season.#2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour,and Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn'tplay a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my familyhas a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that TommySoderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains againabout being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.#3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single seasonscoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single playerget as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season.Not a tough choice.Honorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point totalwhich he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top linethis year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get thedefensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookiemistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feelingthat with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving upanything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defensemanin years to come.Garry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are somethings you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome,he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against hiswishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensivecontribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own endwill make him a much more important part of the team next year.Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.But consistency became a problem for him.A couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members:Tom Misnik, a member of the mailing list, would like to exchange E-mailaddresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer.If you're interested, you can send him mail at:att!ACR.ORG!TMISNIKThe FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winningpercentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th inPatrick), 23-14-5 at home. They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th innext years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored asmany goals as they allowed, 319.The 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.I will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the HockeyNews that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I haveno other way of getting them.I hope you've all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as I have.

"If you agree that good works have a role somewhere, you will generally find yourself in one of two camps:    (1) Faith + Works --> Salvationor (2) Faith --> Salvation + WorksEither (1) works are required for salvation, or (2) faith will inevitably result in good works. I am also of the opinion that salvation is by faith alone, based onEphesians 2 and Romans 3:21-31.  I also conclude that James 2, when read in context, is teaching bullet (2) above. When James speaks of justification, I would claim that he is not speaking of God declaringthe believing sinner innocent in His sight (Paul's use of the word). Instead he is speaking of the sinner's profession of faith being ""justified"" or ""proven"" by the display of good works. Also according to James 2, the abscence of such works is evidence for a ""dead"" or ""useless"" faith which fails to save.James 2 is not a problem for the doctrine of salvation by faith if itis teaching (2).  Works would have their place, not as merit toward salvation, but as evidence of true faith.

"I wouldn't give baserunning that much value.The above effect is clear, but there are other effects as well.  IfOlerud hits a double, any runner on first will score; if Alomar legs anextra base onto a hit in the gap, the runner on first may need to holdat third.  Thus Olerud's doubles have more advancement value thanAlomar's.  (Of course, Alomar is more likely to score after hitting adouble.)Another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is thatthe runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams.  Noteam in the 1950's ran much, but some teams certainly had faster playersthan others.  Still, the current runs created formulas work just as wellin the 1950's for all teams.  Bill James gives the 1955-1958 Senators as an example.  They used HarmonKillebrew regularly as a pinch runner, and in 1957, stole 13 bases with38 times caught stealing.  Yet they scored slightly more runs thanpredicted by Runs Created.",19

"WASHINGTON (UPI) -- A senior State Department official on Tuesdayruled out any softening of U.S. attitudes toward Iraq but said relationswith Iran's Islamic regime could improve substantially if thatgovernment disassociates itself from international terrorism.	``Despite the name-calling and the harsh rhetoric from across theGulf, despite all this, we do not take a position of permanent hostilitytowards the Islamic Republic of Iran,'' David Mack, deputy assistantsecretary for Near Eastern Affairs, said.	The primary U.S. objection is ``Iran's international behaviour''which includes ``extending support of violence'' to disrupt the ArabIsraeli peace process and its rapid build-up of dangerous weapons.	Mack said ``Iran could contribute to regional stability and peace butfirst it is to end the behaviour which threatens this area.''	Mack spoke at the U.S.-GCC business conference aimed at promotingGulf-American trade. He said the ``Middle East will be an item very highon the agenda of the U.S. administration.''	The importance of the Gulf is underlined by Secretary of State WarrenChristoper's visit last year to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait before anywhereelse in the world, Mack said. He added that the U.S. has no long-termplan to station troops in the Gulf.	Mack also insisted that the Clinton administration will continue topressure Iraq to ``comply with all the U.N.

"The following was posted and no doubt retyped by Yigal Ahrens and considering  the importance of the issue and the almost total blackout except in  California, I am reposting to other appropriates groups.    From LA Times, Friday, April 9, 1993.  P. A1.  EVIDENCE OF ADL SPY OPERATION SEIZED BY POLICE  By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer  SAN FRANCISCO -- Police on Thursday served search warrants on the Anti-Defamation League here and in Los Angeles, seizing evidence of a nationwide intelligence network accused of keeping files on more than 950 political groups, newspapers and labor unions and as many as 12,000 people.  Describing the spy operation in great detail, San Francisco authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how operatives of the Anti-Defamation League searched through trash and infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on Arab-American, right-wing and what they called ""pinko"" organizations.  Representatives of the Anti-Defamation League, a well-known organization in the U.S. Jewish community dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, declined detailed comment Thursday but denied breaking any laws.  Police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to gather political intelligence in at least seven cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco.  Groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political spectrum, including such groups as the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan Resistance, Operation Rescue, Greenpeace, the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, the United Farm Workers and the Jewish Defense League.  Also on the list were Mills College, the board of directors of San Francisco public television station KQED and the San Francisco Bay Guardian newspaper.  People who were subjects of the spy operation included former Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey, jailed political extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche and Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent Scott Kraft, who is based in South Africa.  Authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement agencies.  They also alleged that data on some individuals and organizations was sold separately to the South African government.  In addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from police, the Anti-Defamation League could face a total of 48 felony counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief West Coast spy, Roy Bullock, according to the affidavit filed to justify the search warrant.  The Anti-Defamation League disguised payments to Bullock for more than 25 years by funneling $550 a week to Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman, who then paid Bullock, according to the documents released in San Francisco.  Hochman, a former president of the Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles and one of the state's leading tax attorneys, will be out of the city until late next week and could not be reached for comment, his office said.  Until 1990, Hochman, a former U.S. prosecutor, also was a member of a panel appointed by then-Sen. Pete Wilson to secretly make initial recommendations on new federal judges in California.  Hochman is a former regional president of the Anti-Defamation League.  The league, which initially cooperated with police, has denied repeatedly that its intelligence-gathering operation broke any laws. League officials will not confirm or deny whether Bullock was an employee and have said they simply traded information with police departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes.  But in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for Thursday's searches, San Francisco police alleged that ""ADL employees were apparently less than truthful"" in providing information during an earlier search conducted without a warrant.  David Lehrer, executive director of the Los Angeles ADL office, said the organization has not violated the law.  ""There is nothing nefarious about how we operate or what we have done,"" he said.  ""Our record speaks for itself.""  The police affidavit contends that Lehrer had sole control of a secret fund used to pay for ""fact-finding operations.""  Lehrer, according to the documents, signed checks from the account under the name L. Patterson.  An ADL official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending them directly to the Anti-Defamation League.  Bullock, 58, who has been collecting intelligence for the ADL for nearly 40 years, defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with San Francisco police.  He said that he gathered names from many sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as ""Skins"" and ""Pinkos,"" but that did not necessarily mean that they were under surveillance.  ""I might never see or call up on 99% of them again,"" Bullock said. ""And it doesn't mean anything that they're in the files.  It's not a threat to anyone's civil rights that a name appears in my files under, say, 'Pinko.'""  In recent years, Bullock worked closely with San Francisco Police Officer Tom Gerard, who fled to the Phillippines last fall after he was questioned by the FBI in the case.  A former CIA employee, Gerard supplied Bullock with criminal records and Department of Motor Vehicles information such as home addresses, vehicle registration, physical characteristics and drivers license photographs.  Using files gathered for the Anti-Defamation League, Gerard and Bullock also provided information to the South African government, receiving $16,000 over four years, the documents show.  The file on Times staff writer Kraft, which was apparently sold to the South African government, provides some insight into the hit-and-miss nature of the spy operation.  The file notes that Kraft's articles ""appear frequently in The Times and are well researched and written,"" but little else about the file is accurate.  The brief entry confuses The Times' Kraft with another Scott Kraft and provides the South African government with the wrong Kraft's physical description, photograph and other personal information.  Nevertheless, the documents provide illuminating details of how Bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations, from skinheads to left-wing radicals, searching regularly through the trash of target groups.  Using Anti-Defamation League funds, he also ran his own paid informants under code names such as ""Scott"" and ""Scumbag.""  He worked closely with police officers up and down the coast, exchanged information with the FBI and worked with federal agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.  It was Bullock's work as a paid informant for the FBI -- while spying on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League and the South African government -- that proved his undoing. The FBI learned that he was an agent of a foreign government and began investigating, leading to the probe of the Anti-Defamation League's intelligence network.  The Anti-Defamation League employed undercover operatives to gather information in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Washington, Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta, according to the affidavit and investigators.  Joining San Francisco police in searching league offices and a Los Angeles bank were investigators from the office of San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith and the state Franchise Tax Board.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to cooperate with the investigation, was informed of the searches in Los Angeles but not invited to participate.  Investigators suspect that some confidential information in the Anti-Defamation League files may have come from Los Angeles police officers.    From Los Angeles Times, Saturday, April 10, 1993.  P. A23.  ADL VOWS TO COOPERATE WITH SPY INVESTIGATION  By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.  SAN FRANCISCO -- The Anti-Defamation League defended its record as a civil rights group Friday and said it will cooperate with authorities who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential police information on citizens and groups.  But San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith said that Anti-Defamation League employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many felony counts of receiving confidential files, eavesdropping, tax violations and conspiracy.  Police have accused the Anti-Defamation League of not being truthful about its spying operations, which collected information on more than 12,000 individuals and 950 political groups across the political spectrum.  Hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors Thursday show that the ADL maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept files on political figures.  Even so, Smith suggested that if the Anti-Defamation League shut down its spy operation, prosecutors would take that into account when deciding what charges to file.  In a statement released in Washington, National Director Abraham H. Foxman described the ADL as ""a Jewish defense agency which has fought to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 80 years.""  Foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing information to police, journalists, academics, government officials and the public.  It has never been the policy of the ADL to obtain information illegally, he said.  ""Like other journalists, in order to protect the confidentiality and physical safety of its sources, ADL will not comment on the nature or identity of any source of information,"" Foxman said.  The Anti-Defamation League refused to acknowledge that one of its longtime employees, Roy Bullock, was anything more than ""a private individual who is alleged to be an ADL 'informant.'""  Among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements showing how the ADL funneled weekly payments to Bullock through Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman.  ""Roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be distanced from ADL,"" Hochman told a San Francisco police investigator. Hochman could not be reached Friday at his home or office for comment.  Despite the Anti-Defamation League's assertion that it will cooperate with authorities, San Francisco police said the group did not turn over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the group's offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco last fall.  A second round of searches Thursday, this time with search warrants, produced a vast quantity of records, primarily dealing with financial transactions, Smith said.  Further searches may be necessary and it will be at least a month before any charges are filed, he said.  ""The investigation, of course, will go wherever the facts lead us,"" the district attorney said.",10

"I may not be the world's greatest expert on chiggers (a type ofmite indigenous to the south), but I certainly have spent a lotof time contemplating the little buggers over the past six years(since we moved to N.C.).  Here are some observations gained frompainful experience:  1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.     Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more     sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.  2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear     that these things will itch for months.  3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of     it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,     since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could     find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC's special     collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is     required to get it.  4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old     folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work.  I recall     reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers     burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I     think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some     sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.  5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.     A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally     applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is     another preparation called ""Chig Away"" that is a combination of     sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was     prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In     the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get     up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where we     live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They     apparently don't like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur     as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)  6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget     the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment     that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone     creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine     (relieves the itch).  I won't tell you all the things I've tried.     Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this     counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think     it gains nothing).  7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved     by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery     as well.Doctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburbandoctors apparently don't encounter them much.  And the rural doctorsseem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  Isuspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggerswould make a *lot* of money.",5

He called them ""the Great Commission"" but this is NOTdescriptive of Jesus's words in Matt. 10:15.Matt. 10:14, Jerusalem Bible translation:	""And if anyone does not welcome you or listen to what you have	to say, as you walk out of the house or town shake the dust	from your feet.""Matt. 10:15: 	""I tell you solemnly, on the day of Judgment it will not  	go as hard with the land of Sodom and Gomorrah as with  	that town.""""> The above is a good description of Kaflowitz, who keeps harping on > shaking the dust off the feet but ignoring what Christ said next.""   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                                ^^^^The highlighted words refer to Matt 10:14 and 10:15 respectively.And Dean countered:""Actually, this comment of your's is a perfect example of what anintellectually dishonest little sparrowfart you are, since Ispecifically acknowledged the Great Commission and the entreatyto spread the word.  In fact, it is the combination of the twostatements I was addressing, and not just the one, and for you tocharacterize that as ""ignoring"" the instruction to spread theword is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you are.""Of course, Matt 10:15 [quoted above] makes no mention of ""instructionto spread the word.""All these quotes btw are from:Message-ID: <1993Apr13.121624.3400@cbnewsj.cb.att.com>And I claim it correctly, because my question went:""Do you, too, measurethe goodness of a post by its entertainment value, and care nota whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood?""and the closest Dean came to an answer was:""Peter, Peter, Peter.  You're just so stupid, pretentious, dull,and generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself thatthe sport is all there is.""Of course, this does NOT answer my question, which has to do with postsin GENERAL and not my posts in particular.  Surely even Dean knows this,yet he brazenly asserts otherwise, reinforcing his claim with an insult:""So I now restore the answer to your questionthat you deleted.  If you're still unable to figure it out, aska nice kid at the local junior high to help you.  It reallydoesn't take much sophistication to understand.""On top of which, I doubt that the ""answer"" is at all representativeof Dean's true frame of mind.  The insults you have seen quoted thusfar are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of Dean's mind throughout the 284-line post from which these quotes were taken.One wonders whether Dean's mind is so warped as to find sport in allthis.He even dredges up a falsified account ofevents that transpired earlier on another thread:""You made an ass of yourself by claiming that it				^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^was in the tradition of Lent to make public announcements of^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^the ""sins"" of other individuals.""^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^False.  I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one's sins.That I made public announcements of the ""sins"" of others--""sins"", BTW, that were a matter of public record, documented inthe posts of others-- is a different matter.Many of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral thatthey do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins, soI pointed some of them out.  And I expressly set up a whole thread,YOUR TURN, to let people point out MY sins to me.Dean again:""You made an ass of yourselfby saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah wassomehow an attempt to ""paint Jews as plaster saints,"" therebyrevealing your inability to understand the discussion as wellas showing your dislike for people saying positive thingsabout Jews, and now you show your intellectual dishonesty byrepeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made, and thenclaiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge.""Actually, what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jewwho gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocriteaccording to Jewish customs.  In doing so, he was caricaturingJewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding, as well asimplicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity.I went very easily on Dean for this, giving him the benefit ofthe doubt in a post following my initial crack about ""plaster saints"", suggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording.In an astonishing act of ingratitude, Dean now serves up an incrediblydistorted picture of what took place between us, and using it asthe basis of one insult after another.",11

As usual, the bias of the 'Center for Policy Research' echoes    through this newsgroup.  Here we have an enraged Likudnik who    is venting his spleen, and you portray it as if this is going    to become policy.  You don't say what the response to Matza's    suggestion was.

In your effort to portray Israel in an unfavorable light, you     have accomplished nothing, except to prove that a respectable     sounding label like the Center for Policy Research is nothing     but a smoke screen for someone with a heavily biased attitude     against Israel and the need to vent it.

The founder of thissect, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), proclaimed to be thePromised Reformer of this age as foretold in almost all the majorreligions of the world today (Islam, Christianity, Judiasm,  Hin-duism).  He  claimed  to  be  the  long awaited second comming ofJesus Christ (metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the PromisedMessiah.  He  claimed that the prophecies contained in almost allthe great religions of the world about the advent of a  messengerfrom God have been fulfilled.        The claims Hazrat Ahmad raised storms  of  hostility  andextreme  oposition from many priestlike people of Muslims, Chris-tians, Jews and Hindus of that age. Such opposition is often wit-nessed  in  the history of divine reformers. Even today this sectis being persecuted specially in  some  of  the  Muslim  regimes.Dispite  the  opposition  and persecution, this sect has won manyadherents in 130 countries. It has over 10 million followers, whocome from a diverse ethnic and cultural background.        The sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing  abouta better understanding of religion, and the founders of all reli-gions. Its mission is to unite mankind into one Universal  broth-erhood  and  develop  a  better  understanding  of  faith. AhmadiMuslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe-cially religious intollerance and fundamentalism.        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-tablished  a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clin-ics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffedby  volunteer  professional  and are fully financed by the sect'sinternal resources.        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moralreform,  establish  peace and justice, and to unite mankind underone universal religion.NEWSGROUP CREATION: ==================",7

Steve> Steve FrysingerYour might take a look a PLPLOT.  Version 4.99c (actually beta v5.0)can be found anonymous ftp from hagar.ph.utexas.edu, in the pub/plplot directory.  --Mark------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ From the README file of version 4.99c: This is the PLPLOT distribution.  PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for many systems, small (micro) and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size and quickness, it has enough power to satisfy most users, including: standard x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph.  Different line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.  Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent), including a portable metafile format and renderer. The PLPLOT package is freely distributable, but NOT in the public domain. The PLPLOT source code, except header files and those files explicitly granting permission, may not be used in a commercial software package without consent of the authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to include the PLPLOT object library and header files in a commercial package provided that: (1) it is explicitly and prominently stated that the PLPLOT library is freely available, and (2) the full copyrights on the PLPLOT package be displayed somewhere in the documentation for the package. We welcome suggestions on how to improve this code, especially in the form of user-contributed enhancements or bug fixes.  If PLPLOT is used in any published papers, please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work, which will help us to continue improving PLPLOT.  Also, please remember that as PLPLOT is not a commercial product, we cannot be expected to offer the kind of support that a commercial product may.  There is great interest in extending PLPLOT and fixing bugs, but the principal authors can only afford to work on it part time.  Improvements will necessarily focus on those which help us get our work done. PLPLOT is written in C, enabling it to run on many platforms practically without modification.  Fortran programs may use it transparently; stub routines are provided to handle the C<->Fortran interface without any modification of the user program.  C programs are required to include the header file ""plplot.h""; see the documentation for more details. The main documentation for PLPLOT is in the doc/ directory in the form of several TeX files; please consult this for additional information ('latex plotdoc').  Unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to the code, so don't be surprised if some known features are not explained there.  Consult 'Changes.log' to see a list of recent changes.   At present, PLPLOT is known to work on the following systems:	 Unix:	SunOS		 A/IX 		 HP-UX		 Unicos		 DG/UX		 Ultrix		 SysV		 Linux	 Amiga/Exec	 MS-DOS	 OS/2	 NeXT For more information on how to get or use PLPLOT on your system, see:  - appendices to the PLPLOT manual  - system-specific documentation in the appropriate sys/<system> directory. To become a subscriber to the PLPLOT mailing list, send a request to plplot-request@dino.ph.utexas.edu.

"jubilee, Pope >Leo the 12th had a medallion cast with his own image onone side and on >the other side, the Church of Rome symbolized as a""Woman, holding in >her left hand a cross, and in her right a cup withlegend around her, >'Sedet super universum',  'The whole world is herseat.""	You read more into the medal than it is worth.  The Woman is theChurch.  Catholics have always called our Church ""Holy Mother Church""and our ""Mother.""  An example would be from St. Cyprian of Carthage, whowrote in 251 AD, ""Can anyone have God for his Father, who does not havethe Church for his mother?""	Hence the image of the Church as a woman, holding a Cross and a Cup,which tell of the Crucifxition of Our Lord, and of the power of HisBlood (the grail legend, but also, more significantly, it shows that""This is the Cup of the New Covenant in my blood, which shall be shedfor you and for many."" (Luke 22.20), the Cup represents the New Covenantand holds the blood of redemption).  The fact that the woman is holdingboth and is said to have the whole world for her seat, is that theCatholic Church is catholic, that is universal, and is found throughoutthe world, and the Church shows the Crucifixtion and applies the bloodof redemption to all mankind by this spread of hers, thorugh which theHoly Sacrafice of the Mass, can be said and celebrated in all thenations as Malachi predicted in Malachi 1.11, ""From the rising of thesun to its setting, my name is great among the gentiles, and everywherethere is sacrafice, and there is offered to my Name a clean oblation,for my Name is great among the gentiles, says the Lord of hosts.""  Andso we acknowledge what St. Paul wrote ""For as often as you eat thisbread and drink this cup, you show the Lord's death until he comes."" (1Corinthians 11.26)	You are quite right about the identification of ""Babylon the Great,Mother of all Harlots"" with Rome.  I think we simply disagree as to whattime period of Rome the Apostle John is talking about.",7

"From: _Quantum_ Magazine, March/April 1993 pages 42-46	The Problem Book of Anania of Shirak	------------------------------------		""On the ancient peak of Ararat		The centuries have come like seconds		And passed on.""				-Avetik Issahakianby Yuri DanilovSome years ago Journalists interviewing celebrities liked to ask them: ""Whatbooks would you take with you if you were to go off on a space flight?"" And though the number of books allowed on the trip varied from 10 to 30, depending on the type of spacecraft and the generosity of the interviewer, and celebrities are people of the most varied tastes, ages, and professions, not one of them dared to say that he or she would want to take with them atleast one book of arithmetic problems.Some of these people certainly excluded this kind of literature because they were trained in the humanities and had nothing but scorn for ""numbers"" (though secretly afraid of them). Others steered clear of such puzzle books because they were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern mathematics and didn't mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn't know how to solve mere arithmetic problems. Professional mathematicians were no exception. Here's what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin, a specialist in statistics, wrote about arithmetic: ""I willingly confess that any time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem, it wasa hard work for me, and sometimes I failed completely. Of course, like most of my friends, I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route--constructing equations or sets of equations. But we were supposed to avoid using algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . By the way, it's a fact that is well known and oft repeated that, as a rule, neither high school graduates, nor students at teaching colleges, nor teachers beginning their careers(nor, I must add, scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. It seems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade teachers.""Now, I'm not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the bookbag of anyone flying into space. But a sense of justice induces me to recommend one particular problem book, one that will satisfy the most fastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a relatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyage--say, toVenus and back.			One for the ""road""	They both took out the books they brought for the road. Kingsley 	glanced at the Royal Astronomer's book and saw a bright cover with 	a group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers. ""God 	knows what this kind of stuff leads to,"" thought Kingsley.	The Royal Astronomer looked at Kingsley's book and saw the History 	of Herodotus. ""Good Lord, next he'll be reading Thucydides,"" thought 	the Royal Astronomer.					--Fred Hoyle, The Black CloudThe book I'm talking about isn't very big, but its 24 problems constitute 24 elegant miniatures from seventh-century Armenia. Naive and wise at the sametime, rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period, these problems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of Armenian architecture, the church on the island of Akhtamar in Lake Van (in what is now Turkey_. They are as inseparable from the image of Armenia as the elegant letters of the Armenian alphabet, invented by Mesrop Mashtots, or the songs of Komitas, or the paintings of Saryan.An edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a bibliographic rarity. It was published under the title Problems and Solutionsof Vardapet [1] Anania of Shirak, Armenian Mathematician of the Seventh Century (translated and published by I. A. Orbeli, Petrograd, 1918).The abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way of life and customs of that remote epoch when Anania of Shirak lived and worked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book. For many years the book was known only to researchers in the humanities--specialists in Armenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn't let justanyone see it. Even now, after research by K. P. Patkanov, the learned monk Father Kaloust, J.I. Orbeli, A. Abramyan, V. K. Chaloyan, and others has brought the works of Anania of Shirak to light in scholarly circles, the general reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable problem book.		Vardapet Anania of Shirak	Once fell in love with the art of calculation, I thought that no 	philosophical notion can be constructed without number, considering 	it the mother of all wisdom.					--Anania of ShirakAmong ancient Armenian thinkers, Vardapet Anania of Shirak stands out because of the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his work. Some of his works have been preserved. In addition to the Problems andSolutions, the following tracts have found a special place in the estimationof scholars: On Weights and Measures, Cosmography and Calendrical Theory, andArmenian Geography of the Seventh Century A.D. (the authorship of the lastwork was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient Armenia, Movses of Khoren).In his autobiography, Anania of Shirak has this to say about himself:	I, Anania of Shirak, having studied all the science of our	Armenian land and having learned the Holy Scripture intimately, 	in the expression of the psalmist, ""every day I illuminated the 	eyes of my mind."" Feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation,	I came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy, 	the mother of all sciences, without number. I could find in Armenia 	neither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the 	sciences. I therefore went to Greece and met in Theodosiople a man 	named Iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works. He told me	that in Forth Armenia [2] there lived a famous mathematician,	Christosatur. I went this person and spent six months with him. But         soon I noticed that Christosatur was a master not of all science but         only of certain fragmentary facts.	I then went to Constantinople, where I met acquaintances who told me: 	""Why did you go so far, when much closer to us, in Trebizon, on the 	coast of Pontus [3] lives the Byzantine vardapet Tyukhik. He is full 	of wisdom, is known to kings, and knows Armenian literature."" I asked 	them how they knew this. They answered: ""We saw ourselves that many 	people traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man. 	Indeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of Constantinople,	Philagrus, traveled with us, bringing many young persons to become 	pupils of Tyukhik."" When I heard this, I expressed my gratitude to 	God, who had quenched the thirst of His slave.	I went to Tyukhik at the monastery of St. Eugene and explained why I 	He sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of St. 	Gregory; I am glad that all your country will learn from me. I myself 	lived in Armenia for many years as a youth. Ignorance reigned there."" 	Vardapet Tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with 	me. The Lord bestowed upon me His blessing: I completely assimilated 	the science of number, and with such success that my fellow students	at the king's court began to envy me.	I spent eight years with Tyukhik and studied many books that had not 	been translated into our language. For the vardapet had an innumerable 	collection of books: secret and explicit, ecclesiastical and pagan, 	books on art, history, and medicine, books of chronologies. Why 	enumerate them by title? In a word, there is no book that Tyukhik did 	not have. And he had such a gift from the Holy Spirit for translating	that when he sat down to translate something from the Greek into 	Armenian, he did not struggle as other translators did, and the 	translation read as if the work were written in that language 	originally.	Tyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had 	learned the Armenian language. ""When I was young,"" he said, ""I lived 	in Trebizon, at the court of the military chief Ioannus Patricus, and 	for a long time, up to the accession of Mauritius to the throne I 	served as a military man in Armenia and learned your language and 	literature. During one attack by Persian troops on the Greeks, I was 	wounded and escaped to Antioch. I lost all my possessions. Praying to 	the Lord to heal my wounds, I made a promise: ""If You prolong my life, 	I shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to 	collecting treasures of knowledge."" And the Lord heard my prayers. 	After I recovered I went to Jerusalem, and from there to Alexandria 	and Rome. Upon returning to Constantinople, I met a famous philosopher 	from Athens and studied with him for many years. After that I returned 	to my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people.""	After some years that philosopher died. Not finding a replacement for 	him, the king and his courtiers sent for Tyukhik and invited him to 	assume the teacher's position. Tyukhik, citing the promise he made to 	God not to move far from the city, turned down the offer. But because	of his wide leaning, people came streaming from all countries to study 	with him.	And I, the most insignificant of all Armenians, having learned from 	him this powerful science, desired by kings, brought it to our 	country, supported by no one, obligated only to my own industry, God's 	help, and the prayers of the Blessed Educator. And no one thanked me 	for my efforts.				Problems and Solutions	A half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printed	on verge'; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth--on rag paper; 	one forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth--on vellum, and 	forty-five inscribed copies--on Dutch paper. And so, find how many 	copies were printed in all.					--Imitation of Anania of ShirakA Latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli (""books have their own fate"").The fate of Problems and Solutions by Anania of Shirak is quite amazing. Themanuscripts of Anania's book were preserved only because, according to Armenian historians, ""in ancient and medieval Armenia manuscripts were guarded from invaders, like weapons, and cherished, like one's own children."" Bidingtheir time, the manuscripts lay in the Matenadaran, a renowned depository of ancient manuscripts (now the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts).And its hour finally arrived. In 1896 the learned monk Father Kaloust used two manuscripts to publish the problem book, supplementing it with an introduction and commentary. In 1918 the book was translated into Russian, edited, annotated, and typeset by Iosef Orbeli, a prominent scholar (and later a member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR).In the translator's words, the problems of Anania are ""amusing, full of life, and simple."" Orbeli goes on to say: ""The subjects of the problems are generally taken from everyday life. The scene is predominantly his homeland Shirak and the surrounding countryside, and the dramatis personae, if they are named, are the local princes--the Kamsarakans, including Nersekh, who was a contemporary of Anania."" Like other ancient authors, Anania of Shirak used only ""aliquots"" -- that is, fractions with a numerator of 1. When it isnecessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1, one has to represent it as a sum of aliquots (see the epigraph above).Like any true work of art, the problems of Anania suffer terribly in the retelling. You have to read the originals (albeit in translation) in their full glory. So let's open Anania's problem book--a gift from across the ages.Problems 1 and 8 relate to the Armenian uprising against the Persians in A.D. 572.Problem 1My father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the Armenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary heroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops. The first time, he struck down half of the Persian army. The second time, pursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. The third time, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. The Persians who were still alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to Nakhichevan. And so, from this remainder, find how many Persian soldiers there were before the massacre.Problem 8During the famous Armenian uprising against the Persians, when ZaurakKamsarakan killed Suren, one of the Armenian azats[4] sent an envoy to thePersian king to report the baleful news. The envoy covered fifty miles in a day. Fifteen days later, when he learned of this, Zaurak Kamsarakan sent riders in pursuit to bring the envoy back. The riders covered eighty miles in a day. And so, find how many days it took them to catch the envoy.Problem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal. In the Russian translation, they are all called ""dishes."" But in the original Armenian, according to Orbeli's note, the dishes in the first and second instances are called mesur, and in the third instance scutel. Scutel is a common Armenian word, but mesur had not been encountered in Armenian literature before Anania's Problems and Solutions.Problem 18There was a tray in my house. I melted it down and made other vessels from the metal. From one third I made a mesur; from one fourth, another mesur; fromone fifth, two goblets; from one sixth, two scutels; and from two hundred ten drams, I made a bowl. And now, find the weight of the tray.Several of the problems reflect the richness of the Caucasian fauna in Anania's time -- for instance, problem 7.Problem 7Once I was in Marmet, the capital of the Kamsarakans. Strolling along the bank of the river Akhuryan, I saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast. We caught a half and a quarter of the school, and all the fishes that slippedout of the net ended up in a creel. When I looked in the creel, I found forty-five fishes. And now, find how many fishes here were in all.The temptation is great to present all 24 problems. But I'll restrain myselfand offer you just one more.Problem 20 provides some interesting information about the wild animals that inhabited Armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is nomention of them even in zoological reference books. The wild donkey, according to the generally accepted view, never roamed the Armenian lands. Yet Anania of Shirak offers evidence to the contrary .Problem 20The hunting preserve of Nersekh Kamsarakan, ter[5] of Shirak and Asharunik, was at the base of the mountain called Artin. One night great herds of wilddonkey entered the preserve. The hunters could not cope with the donkeys and, running to the village of Talin, told Nersekh about them. When he arrived withhis brothers and azats and entered the preserve, they began killing the wild beasts. Half of the animals were caught in traps, one fourth were killed by arrows. The young, which constituted one twelfth of all the animals, were caught alive, and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears. And so, find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre.		""Set in type by me, Iosef Orbeli""	His biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a 	bibliography.				-- K Uzbashyan, Academician					Iosef Abgarovich OrbeliAnyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy (1/n of the small printing--n is the solution to the epigraph in the previous section) of the Russian translation of Anania of Shirak's Problems and Solutions, a thin book with yellowed pages,has probably noticed the variety of the fonts, the elegance of the borders, and the high quality of the design, printing, and binding. Such great attention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for a degree in bookmaking. And this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma attesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it. An advertisement at the end of the book reads: ""This book was typeset in December 1917 at the printing offices of the Russian Academy of Sciences by me, Iosef Orbeli; the text was also proofread, laid out, and decorated with borders by me. Various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project to the end; the final pages of the book were typeset by M. Strolman.""Typesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned orientalist Iosef Orbeli, who later became the director of the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad. He was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith. Orbeli had already become acquainted with the famous academic printing house Typis Academiae, founded in 1728 and known all over the scientific world for its rich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters. In preparing to publish the corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of Armenian churches, Orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve the unique signs and ligatures. This complicated work was done by M. G.Strolman. (Unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the blockade of Leningrad in World War II.)When Orbeli came to the printing offices of the Academy of Sciences, times were hard. The only way to publish the newly translated Problems of Ananiawas for Orbeli to learn typesetting (he had always been attracted to the printer's craft). In 1922 Orbeli became the director of printing at the Academy of Sciences. Even after he retired, he remained a tireless championof Russian academic typography.

Maybe one of the space travelers will take this very copy of Quantum, and another, looking over her shoulder, will read this article and say to himself: ""This Anania from Shirak seems like a pretty interesting guy. When I get home I'll try to find his problems.""Good luck, my young friend! Anania is sure to entertain you. Perhaps by thenthere will be more than n copies of his timeless Problems and Solutions. And we can hope they will be as lovingly printed as the masterpieces created by Iosef Orbeli.[1] Vardapet (or vartabed) means teacher or learned man in Armenian. (The    Armenian language suffers in English from a dual transliteration scheme.    Thus, Mesrop is often rendered as ""Mesrob"", Komitas as ""Gomidas,"" and so     on).[2] Fourth Armenia was one of fifteen provinces into which, according to    Armenian Geography in the Seventh Century A.D., so-called Great Armenia    was divided.[3] ""Pontus"" (or ""Pontus Euxinus"") was an old name for the Black Sea.[4] ""Azats"" were members one of several strata of freemen in ancient Armenia.[5] ""Ter"" was the title of the heads of sovereign royal families in ancient      Armenia.",9

"About two months ago I purchased the Adaptec ASW-410 driver for use with aCD-ROM drive.  At the time this seemed the thing to do as the documentation Ihad with my Adaptec SCSI controller said that this is the driver to be used withCD-ROM drives.

I wasn't too fussed about thisuntil I upgraded by CD-ROM drive from a Sony CDU-541 to a Sony CDU-641.  I nowfind that the audio-mode will not work.

"The third-party media adapters are usually cheaper (at least in Toronto) thanApple's. I bought the adapters from Asante instead of Apple.That's not true. Only the DECstation 5000/200 comes with a Thinwire(BNC, coaxial) Ethernet connector. The 5000/25, 5000/133 and 5000/240all have a single 15-pin AUI Ethernet connector only. I distinctlyremembered this because when got the 5000/200 first and I thought allof them are going to be Thinwire. I eventually had to go back and orderedDESTAs (DEC's oversized version of an AUI-to-BNC adapter that MUST be usedwith a transciever cable) for the rest of the stations.My advise to the very original poster (Beverly?) is:(1) If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and won't add    machines to it EVER, go for Thinwire regardless of the media type. Going    for UTP (unshielded twisted pair) wiring requires a concentrator which    means extra money and I believe these units come with at least 6 ports.    As for Thicknet, it's a nightmare and cabling is expensive. Avoid it    unless you have no choice (e.g. the two machines are two floors parts).(2) On the Mac side, you will need:    - one Thinwire media adapter (from Apple or third-party).    - MacX (make sure you get version 1.2; 1.1.7 won't run on System 7.1).    - MacTCP (which comes with MacX; if you get MacX v1.2, you should be      getting MacTCP v1.1.1 with it. Don't use earlier versions on a Centris).    - you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the      Thinwire media adapter. So just ask the sales if the adapter is      self-terminated or not.    - configure MacTCP to use ""Ethernet"".(3) On the DECstation side, you will need:    - for a Model 200, you will only need a T-connector.    - for Models 25, 125, 133, 240, you will need an AUI-to-BNC adapter.      Get one that can be plugged in directly to the AUI port of the      DECstation. This way you save the cost of a transciever cable      (a 15-pin AUI male to a 15-pin AUI female cable).    - get a 25ohm terminator.Your two-machine network will look like this:       ##T----------------------------------------------[]      +-----+                                           |      |     |                                           |      +-----+                                         +-----+                                                      |     |                                                      +-----+    DECstation                                        Centris     5000/200                                           650                              OR       ##T----------------------------------------------[]        {=}                                             |      +-----+                                           |      |     |                                         +-----+      +-----+                                         |     |                                                      +-----+    DECstation                                        Centris5000/25,125,133,240                                     650            ##    -> 25ohm terminator   T     -> T connector   ---   -> Thinwire (RG58 coaxial cable)   {=}   -> AUI-to-BNC (i.e. Thick-to-Thin) adapter   []    -> Thickwire media adapter (assuming self-terminated)   |   |Andy",14

"ZOROASTRIANISMSAN JOSE, CA, USAMonday April 5, 1993San Jose Mercury News, Page 1     [Reproduced without permission]_3,700-year tradition still glows -            'Assimilation in U.S. threatens ancient Zoroastrian religion'_By Jeanne Huber, Mercury News Staff Writer   HIGH ON A HILLSIDE above San Jose, flames leap up 24 hours a day from agleaming brass urn in a temple - one of only four in the United States -dedicated to one of the world's most ancient religions.   With the flames go the prayers of about 1,200 Bay Area Zoroastrians thattheir faith will survive this land.   ""There is a fear - a real fear, too,"" said Silloo Tarapore of Lafayette.""We have one generation to do it or to die.""   Many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land.But for Zoroastrians, it is an especially poignant concern.   Their religion has been around for perhaps 3,700 years, a heritage so deepit scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where ""historical sites"" aresometimes less than 100 years old.  It was the religion of the great PersianEmpire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christwas born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from threeZoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians,Jews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, theZoroastrian prophet.   Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are a miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as apeople is very much on their minds.   Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited toleranceof the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followedby nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: causetheir young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.   Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and theyactually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their childrenbecome totally assimilated, they say, it's their children - rather thanthe world at large - who will be the losers.   ""It's important to have an identity,"" said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose,a leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  ""It's importantfor everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life.You don't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect.You can fall back on your own identity.""   For Zoroastrians, there's much to be proud of.   Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in whichanimal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there wasonly one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, whichtranslates as Lord of Wisdom and Light._Good vs. evil_   Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, withthe good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle forgood, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequencessuch as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity,kindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality ofmen and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.   But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not tofollow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact,Joseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths,traced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.   Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into astained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes ofMount Hamilton, is ""Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.""   So it's not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India,where a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escapepersecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy;the overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.   About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from Indiaand Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled fromIran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic statewhere others had no rights.   Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on ""gooddeeds"" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose,the recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about becauseManou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-updowntown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple'sdedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, theZoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.   The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by anIranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six templesin North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on MountHamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto,and Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples onthis continent.   Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and theproperty already had a large house that they have converted to acommunity center.   The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet Zoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted ceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.   Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed-in area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are sometimes called ""fire worshippers,"" they actually consider fire just a symbol of God.  ""It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the cross and Muslims use the Holy Book,"" Bhujwala said.   The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For allIranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day ofthe season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  WithZoroaster's birthday just six days later, the combination of religiousand secular holidays creates something on par with what most of theUnited States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.  For this year's celebration of the prophet's birthday, about 500 peoplecame to worship and revel.   ""The good things in life are not forbidden,"" Esfandiar Anoushiravani,a leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followedproved him right.   Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stoodaround the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chantedthanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smokingsandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruitand nuts.   Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  ""People eat thefruit,"" Tarapore said.  ""It's a way to participate in the ceremony.""_Santa Claus, sort of_   The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.  With flowing whitehair and a bag of gifts for the children, this Amownaroz wore greensymbolic of spring) and red.   He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, Hajefyrouz, who danced andplayed a tambourine.   The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.  ""This is all new for us, too,""one told a visitor who asked what was going on.   A visitor, John A. Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued withthe religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians haveno procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of theircenturies of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hinduking who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with hispeople's religion.   But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at theSan Jose temple whenever he can.   ""When I first heard about this religion,"" he said, ""I thought, my God,this is what a religion should be.  They think for themselves and do good.   ""People who don't have a tradition, something to lean on, what's thedifference with the lower animals?""",11

"Unfortunately, Hep B infection can eventuate in chronic hepatitis andsubsequent cirrhosis.  Although not many patients with Hep B go on tochronic hepatitis, it does still occur in a good number (20%?) and issomething to keep in mind.  Hepatitis C (was: non-A, non-B Hep) muchmore frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis.  There is also anautimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women whichalso leads to cirrhosis.  Of course, cirrhosis is a most unkind disease.  The most dangerouseffects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function. Patients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas,among many other problems, as a result of disturbances in hepaticcirculation.  Less ominously, they can exhibit the effects ofhyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis. These effects include telangiactasias (small red skin lesions) and, inmen, gynecomastia (breast development).  The only real treatment forcirrhosis is liver transplant.Keep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected, at least statistically, inyour friend's case.

I personally believe that the most likelyexplanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers).Don't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in onegospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might makeup in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.

"Note: I am *not* a cable freak, so I might have completelymisunderstood what you said.  Also, my math is frequently noted forbeing wrong, so you'll better check the calculations yourself.I assume that 14.4K means 14.4K Bits.  So if we assume one start andone stopbit, and no protocol overhead, the effective number of bytesper second is 1.44K.Let's also assume that you do not want to transmit your speech instereo, so that you can send 1,440 samples/sec.  This corresponds to aNyquist frequency of 720 Hz, which should be too low, especially ifyou think about the 8-bit low quality sound.  Furthermore, your D/Aconverter will probably not present you with a signal that has beencut off at 720 Hz, but will instead alias in all the higherfrequencies.  (Although you can definitely build a filter to overcomethat problem.)On the other hand, speech should be easily compressible.  For example,you could form power spectra, or you could simply band-pass filter andthen linearize the fourier transforms.  It won't be CD quality sound,but it'll be discernible.  The power spectrum method is very good inthat respect.  I have once programmed such a software compressor, andcompression rates of 90% with relative errors due to linearization ofless than 5% were common.

"Here is some material by Michael Davies on the subject of schism ingeneral and Archishop Lefebvre in particular.  He wrote it around1990.  The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalousactivities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut allthat.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.Joe Buehler...Schism and DisobedienceAccording to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in arefusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of theChurch united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whateverthe subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, hemust be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit tothe Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power ofjurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make itclear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts ofdisobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at thebeginning of this article, it would mean that the number of Americanbishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.The distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear inthe article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire deTheologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who iscertainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schismand disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. FatherCongar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existenceof legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther's rejectionof the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept adecision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does notconstitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopediaexplains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have tointend ""to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies.""  Itadds that ""not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess thischaracter it must include besides the transgression of the command ofthe superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.""Not onlydoes Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command,but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope's authority andhis intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop madehis attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: ""We prayfor the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrationslast June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul IIthe legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don't even say that heis a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favorheresy.""...Intrinsically Schismatic?The principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is inschism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate isan intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such aconsecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This isnot true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act itwould always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917Code of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (seeCanon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty toexcommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismaticchurch in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishopsdiffered radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvreas the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope,that is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and theillicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercisean apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of thebishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers ofjurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose ofensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations andalso to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any waythe gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration ofbishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than theordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of theprimacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the RomanPontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting theChurch could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed inresponse.It appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop's criticsthat he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vaticanhas certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is notso much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code ofCanon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled""Penalties for Specific Offenses"" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). Thefirst part deals with ""Offenses against Religion and the Unity of theChurch"" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, togetherwith apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offensesagainst the unity of the Church.But the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of thiscanon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense againstreligion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in hisexcommunication comes from the third section of ""Penalties forSpecific Offenses"" which is entitled ""Usurpation of EcclesialFunctions and Offenses in their Exercise"" (De Munerum EcclesiasticorumUsurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question isCanon 1382, which reads: ""A bishop who consecrates someone bishop andthe person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without apontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae)excommunication reserved to the Holy See.""The scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offenseof schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparablesmear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainlyjustify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurateparallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter hadbeen convicted of first degree murder.I must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinionof laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyerswithout the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiatedthe charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. FatherPatrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the InstitutCatholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeursactuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was notexcommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiasticalfunction. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop whichconstitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon theillicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers ofthe sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing aparallel Church.Cardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for theAuthentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrationsin the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to    The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not    in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with    offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses    against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are    apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a    pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the    exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the    consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh    Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated    he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because    there was no intention of a breach with the Church.....It is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecratingbishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the leastintent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic andwill never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly thatthe the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy,and that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him toconsecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. CanonLaw provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes thatthe future of the Society could have been guaranteed without theseconsecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that itcould not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurredexcommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelatesas Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannotexpect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against agreat and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted tothe service of the Church and the salvation of souls.Dr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una VoceAssociation, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and heknows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has nogreater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre andthe Holy See during the Archbishop's lifetime. A quotation from astatement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February1989 Remnant merits careful study:",7
"Well, I guess I'm left wondering just who all the 'light fascists'think *they* are.  Yes, I understand the issues.  I don't evenparticularly care for the idea.  But am I the only one that finds thesort of overreaction above just a *little* questionable?  You mustfind things like the Moon *really* obnoxious in their pollution.A few questions for those frothing at the mouth to ask themselves:	1) How long is this thing supposed to stay up?  Sounds like itwould have a *huge* drag area, not a lot of mass, and be in a fairlylow orbit.	2) Just what orbital parameters are we talking about here?What real impact are we talking about, really?  How many opticalastronomers are *really* going to be impacted?	3) Which is more important; adding a few extra days of'seeing' for (very few) optical astronomers or getting the data thesensors are supposed to return along with the data for largeinflatables (and the potential there for an inflatable space station)?The choice would seem to be one or the other, since the advertising isbeing used to help fund this thing.	4) If your answer to 3) above was ""the astronomers"", then feelfree to come up with some other way to fund the (to my mind) moreimportant research data that would be gained by this WITHOUT SPENDINGANY MORE OF MY MONEY TO DO IT.

"I want to achieve an overall throughput rate of around 5 megabytes / secfor very large data transfers.  (Around 5 MB.)I have a Quadra 950. I have a NuBus network card that can pump data in to mac memory at 8.5 MB/s.         (using block-mode transfers)I have a high-speed disk array (no asynchronous PB calls) that can         achieve 6.8 MB/s.Let's say all transfers go from disk to buffer to network card.It is not enough to first transfer all the data from the disk to buffer,then transfer all the data from the buffer to card.  (6.8 MB/s then 8.5 MB/sresult in an overall 3.8 MB/s.  Too slow!)So I tried the following scheme: For an n-megabyte transfer, Step 1:                                Load the 1st MB from disk to buffer.Step 2: Asynch send 1st MB out card,   Load the 2nd MB from disk to buffer.Step 3: Asynch send 2nd MB out card,   Load the 3rd MB from disk to buffer.        ...Step n: Asynch send the n-1 MB out card, Load the nth MB from disk to buffer.Step n+1: Send the nth MB out card.Even though the code apparently does execute the card transfer asynchronously,and the card does not use the Mac cpu at all,  (It is using the buffer, tho')each of the steps 2 through n take as long as if the two transfers wereexecuted one after another.  So there is no improvement in the rate.Why?Is the mac RAM dual-port?  (So the NuBus card and the disk driver can bothaccess data at the same time.)Is the problem that the two devices, card and disk driver, both have to usethe same bus to mac RAM?Is there anything I can do?",14

".d..d.I just thought of another one, in the Bible, so it's definately not becauseof *lack* of religion.  The Book of Esther (which I read the other day forother reasons) describes the origin of Pur'im, a Jewish celbration of joyand peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people werekilled when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions lying about (you couldn't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice,peaceful solution.)  'Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring tomind...I agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbersof people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originallyintended for.That doesn't reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion, it isjust a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure inthe Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning inreligious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Manypeople have been led by religious leaders more involved in their ownstomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven tokill by their leaders.The point is that there are many things involved in religion that oftenlead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasantside effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switchingbetween Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.  @Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiestparts of Man's history.@Atheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideologicalsocial caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs.The overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groupswith very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution tofurther their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that thesewere groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religiouspersecution not because of any belief system but because it made them morepowerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically, Bobby uses these examplesbecause there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought overreligion that he does not have many choices.Well, I'm off to Key West where the only flames are heating the bottom oflittle silver butter-dishes.-ciao",0

He got more attention from the media than was warranted from hisbaseball playing, though; his hype was a lot better than his hitting.That is the basis for the net.comments about him being overrated.

"Note: I am cross-posting (actually, emailing) this to bit.listserv.catholic while main posting goes to soc.religion.christian.[Quotations omitted.  This is in response to a question aboutthe Immaculate Conception.  I explained it, but left justificationup to our Catholic readers.  --clh]There is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for themention of Mary's _blessedness_/full of grace in the ""Annunciation"" byAngel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28 And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _""Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.""_Now, now, hold that line of thought - ""the Lord is with Mary &blessed art thou among women"" - while you read on....In the book, ""First Lady of the World, A Popular History ofDevotion to Mary"" by Peter Lappin:The _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicatedthan the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possiblethat the feast of _Mary's Conception_ under the title ""The Conceptionof Saint Anne"", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ ofa woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter,just as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer inemphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracleof grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Maryis the incorruptible timber ""out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_of Christ's sinless body""; she is ""God's Eden, in whom there isno tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms.""  Her perfectbeauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, herpurity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus,she was hailed as ""innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate,spotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily fromamong thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve""....At the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan,John Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a greater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from allsin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_....Now let's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin.From ""Pocket Catholic Cathechism"" by John A. Hardon:Baptism -Concupiscence Remains after Baptism.Concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptizedbut since it is left to provide trial, it has no power toinjure those who do not consent and who by the grace ofChrist Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).Original gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall:In the light of the foregoing, we see that our firstparents were originally gifted three times over:-They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the power to think and to choose freely.-The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires.-They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace, the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding title to enter heaven.By their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural andpreternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (withoutlosing) their natural capacity to reason and to choosefreely.Baptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam'ssin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ giftsbut gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of ourbodies on the last day...Going back to _Immaculate Conception_(I am not sure if this interpretation is in any otherbooks but it may be another contribution to the 'puzzle'):Given the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at anon-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born AND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary's birth butSTILL, the Angel Gabriel's greetings was:""Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you.Blessed art thou amongst women"".Even Mary was confused about this greeting.Mary could very well have possessed all of the_treefold original gifts above_ given to our firstparents (Adam and Eve before their sin):    Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)    Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)    The Lord is with you (At those times, God would                definitely want to be with those He                has made _blessed_)    Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)At the conception, God made Mary _full of graceand blessed_ as the 'tabernacle' for the coming bodyof Christ and so,Immaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary stillhas maintained her Immaculate Heart.",7

"This appears to be generic calling upon the name of the anti-christ.Just for the hell of it, let's destroy this remark. Let us imagine thatthe executive branch actually could extract keys from the escrow houseswithout anyone knowing, or telling. Now what? Dick has 80 bits of data.What the hell's he gonna do with it?	1) Trot around to the telco and say 'we'd like an unauthoriseddecrypting tap'. Uh huh.	2) Break in to watergate and install his own tap (so his people stilldo have to break in, neat, huh?) record some noise, then get the ExecutiveBranch Phone Decryption Box (huh? they've got one? Goodness, wait 'til thewashington post gets hold of this) and decrypt the noise.	3) More likely, stare at the key, and say 'Oh, hell it's notworth all this bloody hassle'	Truth is, even granted *lots* of covert power on the part ofthe Executive Branch, this system is *more* difficult to tap with thanPOTS gear. The fact that it is easier to tap than some hypotheticalsystem neither you nor I am going to place on our phones is neitherhere nor there.	The only rational concerns I am seeing raised are:	a) is the key really just chopped in half, and not some XORarrangement? That is, has some egregious technical error been builtin to the plan?	b) is this is the first step toward strict regulation of strongencryption?	This is b), of course. I suspect not. If the government actuallywanted to make such regs, they'd just do it. A few hundred people on Usenetyelling about it wouldn't even slow the machine down.	Besides, who is this mysterious 'they' who's going to take awayall our rights the instant we let our guard down? Congress? That gangof buffoons can't even balance their checkbooks. The FBI?

"Excerpts from the Clipper announcement, with some questions:In these two sections the phrases `or other legal order' and `normally acourt order' imply there is some other way or ways of doing a legalwiretap. What is/are these? How do they affect the way people who trust thesystem of court orders to protect them feel about this escrow system?The second section shows the sequence of events.The law enforcer, armed with his warrant, attaches his headphones to theline with his croc-clips (remember, these are the folk who couldn't copewith digital telephony) and hears a load of modem-like tones (we aretalking analogue telephony here).What next? What modulation scheme do these Clipper boxes use?Is it possible to record the tones for use after the keys are obtained?I thought it was quite difficult to record a modem session at someintermediate point on the line. Maybe they have taken a crash coursein data comms and have a unit that demodulates the tones and stores thedigital stream for decryption later. This would still suffer from thesame problems as trying to record the tones as the demodulator would notbe at one end of the line. If calls can't be recorded for decryption laterit would be quite easy to foil the system by buying lots of Clipper units(these are supposed to be cheap mass market items) and using them in turn.How tolerant is the modulation scheme to errors? These things are proposedfor use by US corporations to secure their foreign offices, where phoneline quality may well be poor. It seems hard enough to me to get digitisedspeech of any quality into something a modem can handle without having toadd lots of error correction to keep the decryption in sync.This raises an intersting question in the UK. Here it is illegal to connectanything to a public telecomms network without it being approved by a bodycalled BABT. It has been stated, either here or in the uk.telecom group,that they will not approve equipment that does encryption. I don't knowif this is true or not, but this would make a good test case.Perhaps `friendly' countries, and the UK may still qualify, will getto fish in the escrowed key pool as well.",3

"Sigha.  1) Trying to figure out a way to put a halogen beam on my CB360T... Are there any easy ways to do this (i.e. a ""slip-in"" bulb replacement)?  2) Was told by a guy at the bike shop that my ""not damn near bright enough"" incandescent beam might be caused by a perma-low battery. So I went and picked up this cheapo ""Motorcycle battery and charging system tester""... Hook it up to the battery, it's got 3 lights on ""Very good charge""... Start the engine (to test the charging system), and it doesn't even REGISTER. It's supposed to light 5 or 6 lights if everything is OK, but it stays down at the same point as just the battery.  My question here is, if indeed my charging system is just plain messed up, how the HECK is the battery staying fully charged? I'd think it would be darned near dead from supporting my lights, etc...  Do the '75 CB360T's have a problem with their charging system? Are they just generally slower charging than what is normal for bigger bikes?  Is there an easy fix for this?  3) Happy noise: Put 300 miles on my bike this weekend, finally got myass an endorsement.... which is REALLY GOOD, because my cage just quit running worth a damn and I won't have money to repair it until the first... ;) And the weatherman says ""Bright and Sunny all week, 20% chance of rain on friday""...",18

"/ iftccu:talk.politics.guns / mikey@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu (Strider) /  8:51 pm  Apr 12, 1993 /I've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (evencontributed a few comments) but this stuff ""I'd rather face a knife thana gun"" has GOT to come from ignorance!  I used to think pretty much thesame thing, then I got 'educated.'People do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or howquickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don't understand thatit takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick(within a minute or so) death.The death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentagepoints of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadlyonly in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is aremote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls aspherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.Most people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger byaccident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match fora holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has onlymoderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for aDRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs outof ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill andability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast andstrong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacksused by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolledslashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trainedmartial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go upagainst a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad asthe attacker.Practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicingwith knives requires only a small area and something to simulate aknife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice theirknife attacks in prison.If you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realizethese facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong isthe knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experiencedattacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year oldman with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in aboutone and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walkingcast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strikein 1 second.  I'm old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3seconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weaponsthat you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chestwith a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not thepointed end.)Add to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth.Except in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round thatdestroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelveseconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.'This is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police womanin L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  Thatlady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  Allfour of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Attagirl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apexof her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver anddestroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ballsized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but wasout of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eightmonths!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She wason her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't thinkcivilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.The moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knifeattacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A goodalternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk(a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchorthem.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contactweapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' andis more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming acaliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usuallydo this.Remember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to liveand them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keepus alive.I don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I nowknow, I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an gun.  It wouldhave to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, IWOULDN'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do notfear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizenbehind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to dowhatever it takes.",8

"The answer to your first question is rather difficult to answer withoutdoing a lot of autopsies.  The second question is something that's beenknown for some time.  It appears that within about 15 years of quittingsmoking a person's risk for developing lung cancer drops to that of theperson who never smoked (assuming you do not get lung cancer in theinterim!).  The risk to someone who smoked the equivalent of a pack perday for 40 years is around 20 times as high as a non-smoker.  Stillrather low overall, but significant.  Personally, I'd be more concernedabout heart disease secondary to smoking -- it's much more common, andeven a small increase in risk is significant there.",5
"I agree and disagree.  John is saying that the batters efforts will resultin 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400%does not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I wouldrather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% ineach of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winningby .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obviouspositive association between John's statistic and winning games.  Thus,before you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study mustgo into what sort of relationship there is.The only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactlyhow many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over manyseasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some playersperformance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is aplayer who gets an out gets a ""negative probability"" in most cases.Thus, I'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbersfor a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes,they will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also,the pitchers' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have giventhem a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter thatpulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.  No, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I wouldthink however, that the number of runs you score in the first inningwould be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score in the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usuallycomes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to arguethat any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importanceto those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runsoften means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starterwho gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  Theoffence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am notsaying all late inning situations are equally important either.  IfI am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how manyruns my pitcher gives up in the ninth.       No, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning wouldbe 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look,if you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly highprobability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of theball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers,fouls, bad defense, etc. caused a ""negative chance"" that the teamwould win. From reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that thosewho critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.At first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it reallydoes not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain playersin crucial situation elevate their performance and others performancegoes down.  I've never seen convincing proof that this really happens.So, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that exceptfor a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association toplayer performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if youdo not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out whatthe average value of a home run is for example.  We may find forinstance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15%on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%.I bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was justas good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.How do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have theexact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K's, BB's,etc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitchedin closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was morevaluble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better pitcher?  They were probably about the same.",19

"The commercial uses of a transportation system between already-settled-and-civilized areas are obvious.  Spaceflight is NOT in this position.The correct analogy is not with aviation of the '30's, but the longtransocean voyages of the Age of Discovery.  It didn't require gov't tofund these as long as something was known about the potential for profitat the destination.  In practice, some were gov't funded, some were private.But there was no way that any wise investor would spend a large amountof money on a very risky investment with no idea of the possible payoff.  I am sure that a thriving spaceflight industry will eventually develop,and large numbers of people will live and work off-Earth.  But if you askme for specific justifications other than the increased resource base, Ican't give them.  We just don't know enough.

"I have the same problem.  I have looked at Motif++, WWL, InterViews, GINA++,and a few variations on the above.  I've also done a cursory examinationof Rogue Wave's View.h++.  I like View.h++'s abstractions best of all of thetoolkits I mentioned, but the resulting code looks little like Motif, and Ihave little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise resultin significant longevity for my code.  GINA++ allows you to write code whichlooks a great deal like Motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance,but the resulting code is almost too Motif-like, and is certainly notsignificantly less verbose than equivalent C code.  InterViews lookspromising, but I haven't found a free version with Motif support, and I'mnot confident how widely InterViews with Motif support will be adopted,and what (if any) specific Motif support will be available over time.  Theother libraries produce code which is less Motif-like, but which does not makesufficient use of the features of C++ to simplify my coding task.At this point, my inclination is to write my Motif manipulation routines inC, and invoke those routines from my C++ code using simple abstractions suitedto my specific task.  Later, if OSF or some credible standards-setting bodycomes up with a C++ interface to Motif, I will change to that.  It does meno goo to write in C++ if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code whichleaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industrydirections.  It's better to take a standard if inferior solution for nowthan to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with bothuseless code and useless skills a few years from now.  Views.h++ is the onlylibrary I'd consider right now, but in our environment, we'd end up spendingnearly $5000 to use it, and I can't justify it when it's likely to causeshort-term productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction, and isunlikely to be a sufficiently long-lived solution for us to reap the benefitsat the high end of the J curve.- Brad",15

"Hi Folks,I recently bought a 1981 Mercury Capri (my first car ever!).I have noticed a few problems with the car :	1. It gives very low gas mileage (something like           11 miles / gallon ; I hear other car owners speak of           gas-mileage figures like 25 miles/gallon (wow!) etc.).	2. When I start the car, it goes into high idling (something           like 1500 (or is it 15000 ?) rpm. After driving 4 or 5 miles,            it comes down to 300 (or 3000?) rpm. I would like to know if there is any way by which I can fix theseproblems. Or is it natural for an old car like this ? (it hasdone about 117,000 miles).

">Does anyone know how to size cold gas roll control thruster tanks   >for sounding rockets?   Well, first you work out how much cold gas you need, then make the   tanks big enough.Our sounding rocket payload, with telemetry, guidance, etc. etc. and atelescope cluster, weighs around 1100 pounds.  It uses freon jets forsteering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ieduring our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty muchcontinuously firing on a ~10% duty cycle or so...).  The jets alsoneed to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization, andflip the payload around to look at the Sun.We have two freon tanks, each holding ~5 liters of freon (I'm speakingonly from memory of the last flight).  The ground crew at WSMR choose howmuch freon to use based on some black-magic algorithm.  They haveextra tank modules that just bolt into the payload stack.This should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas quantity.  If you really need to know, send me email and I'll try to get youin touch with our ground crew people.Cheers,Craig",6
"Please realize that I am frequently getting in trouble forstraying from orthodoxy, but here is my opinion:I never thought of these two ideas being ""against"" each other.People might quibble about what ""intrinsically"" means but thereason we are sinners is because we do not behave as good as weare. The message of Christ is that each of us are not only good,but great, that we can approach perfection, albeit perhaps through a different technique than you claim Buddhism teaches. Because we donot realize our greatness, we sin. Peter had no problem walking on water until a little doubt crept in.Doesn't David ask in the 8th Psalm ""what is man that you [God] should care for him, but you have made him just a little lower than the angels""?I probably exagerate in my mind what a scrawny little kid Davidwas, just as I probably exagerate what a gigantic monster Goliathwas, but David's power easily defeated Goliath's.Remember the rich young man who comes up to Jesus and asks whathe can do to enter the Kingdom, Jesus says follow the commandments.I always picture the smug look on his face as he says he's done thathis whole life, probably anticipating an ""attaboy"" from the Messiah. Instead Jesus gives him a harder task, sell everythingand follow Him. Jesus is raising the bar. The desciples sayhow can anyone do this if it's so hard even for rich people.Jesus says anyone can do it, with God's help.Jesus says not only can we avoid killing people, we can avoidgetting angry at people. Not only can we avoid committingadultery, we can control our own desires. I realize this was not your main point, but I wonder how otherpeople see this. (Please forgive any generalizations I am about to make.)Your point about how ""hard"" other religions are is a good one, just as your ""Parting Question"" is a tough question. I think that Muslimsworship the same God as I do, we can learn from their name ""submission"".Hindus and Buddhists and Taoists, etc. claim that ""God"" is impersonal. Is God personal or impersonal? I say yes, but if I think a littlemore my answer is whichever is greater. I think it is greater to be a personal entity, with an individual consciousness, butyou're right that that might be a cultural bias. If I think moreI must admit that God's personal nature is as far beyond myconception as His impersonal nature is beyond the Hindu'sconception. If somehow Jesus could fit into Hindu cosmologythen maybe I wouldn't have a problem, though that is hard to imagine.Are there any former (or present) ""Eastern Religion"" members here who could comment?",7

": >True, man did not invent the need for food, shelter, warmth and the ilk,: >but man did invent the property laws and the laws of trespass.   : But how do you think property is generated ? Does it grow automatically: on trees when we wish so, or someone has to produce it ?Some say it was generated by God or Goddess; some say it was the result ofthe coalescence of billions of tons of interstellar debris.  In either case,the property of which Xavier speaks has been around for millions of years.:     It all follows from the fact that Mother Nature does not: provide us automatically with our needs,Oh?  When did She *stop*?  Mother Nature has been automatically providingus with her bounty ever since we crawled out of the primordial ooze.  Itis not ""produced"": it produces itself, year after year.  Last night, forexample, I saw four deer crossing the road (pretty sight, too); in anearlier time, one of them would have been dinner.: There are 2 ways to go with produced things: the first is to : _trade_ it with the the person(s) who produced it. : The other one is to take it with a gun from the person who produced: it. The first way is the civilized method, the second is how savages: arrange their affairs.The American Indians had no concept of ownership of property, and oftenfreely gave of their supplies to neighboring tribes, trading food andclothing for weapons or services.  The Native Hawaiians, like theirPolynesian ancestors, also could not conceive of that idea, and sharedmany things with the other Islanders.  In fact, ""hi'ipoi"", the Hawaiianword for ""cherish"" means ""sharing food"".  The Great Mahele, in whichthe Islands were divided up more-or-less evenly between the rich andthe poor, was a white man's idea.  In Africa, villagers will oftenshare tools, crops, and clothing with other members of their own villageand neighboring villages.  Every anthropologist who has ever been toAfrica has at least one tale of the difficulties arising from the so-called ""theft"" of the scientists possessions -- two concepts of which,until the visitors came along, the natives had no understanding.These are the people we call ""savages"".On the other hand, car-jackings and muggings are up from last year.Dov, before you make further comment on this thread, I think it wouldbehoove you to study *all* of the facts.",10

"Hello,	I understand this philosophy.  The bears are a nationaltreasure, the area is their sanctuary and people who enter itdo so at their own risk.

The 27th was a short day atwork, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decidedto go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the EternalFlame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I hadwalked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakesbehind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24Volga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the car. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit,and the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn't have anything on her head, and her hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They're 40 to 45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to helpthem. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there?When I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn't see what it was, but it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the Eternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circlearound it. I ask, ""What's going on?"" Someone tells me, ""Come listen."" Wellthey were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: ""BrotherMuslims, our time has come . . . "" and something else along that line. Ididn't understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to get a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter. New people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. Andthe comments started: ""Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!"" and ""There'sno need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us."" I even heard that: ""All Moscow is behind us."" Well I watched and listened in and realized that this was no joke. I quietly left and went home.Now before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh, that there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of things, but I didn't have any idea what was really going on.My wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt's house in Baku. I didn't say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around twoo'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and shouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly,like they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a demonstration and move slowly.My wife asks what's going on out there. I say I don't know. I put on someoutdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowdpeople are shouting ""Down with the Armenians!"" and ""Death to the Armenians!"" Iwaited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street on the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned and went against the traffic--it's one way there--down the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there was a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same kind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside from the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only youngpeople in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.My wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind ofuneasy and said, ""No, let's stay at home instead."" An hour went by, or maybe an hour and a half. Well, I wasn't keeping track of the time, I can't sayexactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now onthe side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.I put outside clothes on and went out again. There's noise, an uproar outside,and the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time there were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more aggressive. No, I think, something's wrong here, this isn't any demonstration.They would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run again. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I followed them. I was thinking I'd just watch and see. Who knew where this was leading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one side, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square and heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There was some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals.I heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. ""We don't need perestroika, we want to go on living like we have been."" Now what did they mean by ""living like we have been?"" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else. But too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense of others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just in Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I've never seen it anywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.Now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians' apartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn't hear them say ""kill them"" over the microphone, I only heard ""beat them and drive them out."" I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, thenanother are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Offto the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and I think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB.There were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn't see any of them try to pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.Well I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was nodemonstration, and I had to protect my family.I left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was nextto the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai-lor's shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some-thing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look becauseafter all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weaponsin there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City Party Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I saw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the cases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15 to 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried off by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standingright next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe about the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha. When I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was about a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He has a package in his hand, and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out. I have never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I've seen a lot of people smoke it, I've seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled around and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.Before I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting. I turned around and saw them running. Well I'll just keep on going like I am, I thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags. And I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the street. He's a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag, which had ""Ermeni oryum"" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means ""Death to Armenians!"" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don't reallyknow what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father's name isRafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a darkblue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His family, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on Narimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars; their apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the left. Now Rafik's little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son was carrying a flag that said ""Death to Armenians!"" I was surprised because before this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being done not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.Well anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, ""It's OK, it'll pass, they're young kids, they've just gotten all whooped up."" Naturally I didn't want her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And this time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn't see where. Well I think, here we go, the machine's in motion. They weren't handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn't see people drinking and smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and hashish to put in a store window!So the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one would stop them now, they weren't even trying, although, I'll say it again, the police were there, I saw them. And it's not just that the police weren't breaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time. True, at the time I couldn't even imagine that under our government, our much-vaunted leadership--and I'm not afraid to say these words: so many people died, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I couldn't imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be specific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of Sumgait, I couldn't imagine that such things could take place.When they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: ""Let's go upstairs."" We went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the evening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more.I stopped at ""The Corner,"" a place called that right next to the bazaar. I look and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to the bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old. The crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed toward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person, wheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as though it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more noise, and the glass was flying again.We spent the night at the neighbors'. My apartment was on the first floor,there was really no way to defend yourself there.In the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town. On the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or what happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the bread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying there hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standingyou couldn't even see him.That was on the morning of February 28.

"Ideologies also split, giving more to disagree upon, and may also leadto intolerance.  So do you also oppose all ideologies?I don't think your argument is an argument against religion at all, butjust points out the weaknesses of human nature.I would like a reference if you have got one, for this is news to me.One must approach the Qur'an with intelligence.  Any thinking approachto the Qur'an cannot but interpret the above verse and others like itthat women and men are spiritual equals.I think that the above verse does clearly imply that women havesouls.  Does it make any sense for something without a soul to beforgiven?  Or to have a great reward (understood to be in theafter-life)?  I think the usual answer would be no -- in which case, thepart saying ""For them has God prepared forgiveness and a great reward""says they have souls.  (If it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven, then I have no idea _what_ a soul is.)As for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priorityin all interpretations, any thinking approach to the Qur'an has to giveall verses of the Qur'an equal priority.  That is because, according toMuslim belief, the _whole_ Qur'an is the revelation of God -- in fact,denying the truth of any part of the Qur'an is sufficient to beconsidered a disbeliever in Islam.Look, any approach to the Qur'an must be done with intelligence andthought.  It is in this fashion that one can try to understand theQuran's message.  In a book of finite length, it cannot explicitlyanswer every question you want to put to it, but through its teachingsit can guide you.  I think, however, that women are the spiritual equalsof men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse, and thatsince women can clearly be ""forgiven"" and ""rewarded"" they _must_ havesouls (from the above verse).Let's try to understand what the Qur'an is trying to teach, rather thantry to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring thispassage or that passage.  The misinterpretations of the Qur'an based onignoring this verse or that verse are infinite, but the interpretations fully consistent are more limited.  Let's try to discuss theseinterpretations consistent with the text rather than how people canignore this bit or that bit, for that is just showing how people can tryto twist Islam for their own ends -- something I do not deny -- butprovides no reflection on the true teachings of Islam whatsoever.",0

"Are you trying to say that there were no massacres in Deir Yassin   or in Sabra and Shatila? If so then let me tell you some good jokes:   There is not and was not any such thing like jewish killing in WWII   Palestinians just did what Davidians did for fourty years and more.   In fact no one was killed in any war at any time or any place.   People die that is all. No one gets killed.   Maybe also vietamiese didn't die in Vietnam war killed by american   napalm they were just pyromaniacs and that's all.   Maybe jews just liked gas chambers and no one forced them to get in there.they    may be thought it was like snifing cocaine. No?   What do you think of this ? Isn't it stupid to say so?   Well it is as stupid as what you said .Next time you want to lie do it   intelligently.   Sincerely yours.   HassanArab civilians did die at Dir yassin. But there was no massacre. Firstof all, the village housed many *armed* troops. Secondly, the Irgunand Stern fighters had absolutely no intentions of killing civilians.The village was attacked only for its military significance. In fact,a warning was given to the occupants of the village to leave beforethe attack was to begin.By all rational standards, Dir Yassin was not a massacre. The killingwas unintentional. The village housed Arab snipers and Arab troops.Thus it was attacked for its military significance. It was notattacked with intentions of killing any civilians.To even compare Dir Yassin, in which some 120 or so Arabs died, to theHolocaust is absurd. The Irgun did not want to kill any civilians. Thevillage had almost 1000 inhabitants, most of whom survived.",9

"No, you have completely misunderstood.  I was opposed to intervention inSomalia for the same reason I am opposed to intervention in Bosnia - there isno security interest of the United States there which justifies risking thelives of American servicemen, and there are too many crises in the world for usto take on all of them.  In the case of Bosnia, the risks are obviously muchgreater, and there are other countries in a much better position and with farbetter reasons to take action than the US.You continue to misunderstand.  I did not say the reason why people want tointervene is because of racist (<- you seem to be overly fond of using thisword, btw.  I said the phenomenon was race-related, which is not the same asracist.  Perhaps this distinction is too subtle for you to grasp) motives - Isaid the attention and outrage at the entire Yugoslavian situation was a resultof it being 1) closer to home, 2) happening to people we can identify with, and3) relentlessly harped on by the media.  I never said anything about which sidewould be preferred, which has a lot more to do with the presentation of theconflict than any psychological factors.  I think there is no doubt that despitethe fact we intervened in Somalia, the level of attention devoted to there wasconsiderably less than what is devoted to Bosnia, if the newspapers and tv newsI see are any guide.",9

"Agreed.  It is a failure of libertarianism if the ideology does not provide anyreasonable way to restrain such actions other than utopian dreams.  Justas Marxism ""fails"" to specify how pure communism is to be achieved andthe state is to ""wither away,"" libertarians frequently fail to show howweakening the power of the state will result in improvement in the humancondition.This is a strawman argument and fails on several grounds.  In this case,""limited"" and ""big"" government are not defined.  I would point out thatLebanon, Somalia, and the former Yugoslavia are by some definitions nationswith ""limited"" government, while the US, Canada, and nations in Western Europe (where ""people would rather live"") are often pointed out as nations with ""big government"" from a libertarian point of view.  The argument is not between those who want ""limited"" government and thosewho want ""unlimited"" government.  It is between those who believegovernment regulation in a capitalist economy serves worthwhile ends andthose who believe such regulation is neither desirable on empirical grounds nor justifiable on ideological grounds.jsh",10

Some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out andothers are socketted.  These count.  If the box with internal terminationscannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to bedisabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets.  If you have 2boxes with internal terminations, the terminations in one box has to bedisabled...., etc.  I am sure that this has been covered by the ""experts"".My experience with SCSI boxes that connect to the Mac indicates that theymust have some software package for the Mac to 'talk' to them.

I will argue that your latter statement, ""I believe that no gods exist""does rest upon faith - that is, if you are making a POSITIVE statement that ""no gods exist"" (strong atheism) rather than merely saying I don't  know and therefore don't believe in them and don't NOT believe in then(weak atheism). Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying  I BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even after reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.But first let me say the following.We might have a language problem here - in regards to ""faith"" and""existence"". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist.To exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVEbeing - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does notexist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it's rather pointlessto debate the so called ""existence"" of God - and that is not whatI'm doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground ofbeing. When you say that ""god does not exist"", I also accept thisstatement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However,in what follows I will use the phrase ""the existence of God"" in it's'usual sense' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it.I would like a clarification upon what you mean by ""the existence ofGod"". We also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is whatfaith 1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTYb  (1): fidelity to one's promises   (2): sincerity of intentions2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God   (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religionb  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   (2): complete trust3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^of religious beliefssyn see BELIEFOne can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you saythat you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion""based upon observation"", I will have to ask ""what observtions areyou refering to?"" There are NO observations - pro or con - thatare valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observationscan only point you in a direction - a direction that we might evenbe predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes partents ""believe in God"" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusionabout the ""existence"" or ""non-existence"" of God requires a leap - andyou have made this leap when you actively say ""I believe that God  does/does not exist"". Personally, I think that both statements aremisguided. Arguing over the ""existence"" of God is precisely the wrong wayto find Him (and yes, I use ""Him"" because a personal God is the only viable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use ""She"" go ahead. Of course God is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to anthropomorphise. If you want me to explain myself further I'll be glad to.) And please, if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently disagree - it's in no ones advantage to start name calling. If a person thinks I've misunderstood something in the FAQs, or if they they think I have not read them well enough, just point out to me the error of my ways and I correct the situation. I'm interested in a polite and well  thought out discussion.",0

"I would like to add my support for a misc.taoism discussion group.I applaud the enthusiam shown by the person posting <79899@cup.portal.com> ""Thyagi@cup.portal.com"" (I read in alt.magick), but I differwith him/her in believing that at least some minimal parameters should be agreed upon.But if we don't limit it to *something*, the discussion degenerates intoa big amorphous glob. Other questions Thyagi proposes are:It seems to me that these questions more properly fall into thecategory of ""general metaphysics"". I would prefer any misc.taoismto deal more closely with topics and works more closely associatedwith at least ""semi-orthodox"" Taoism: with established classic works definitely included and works like Mantak Chia's argued about! I think ""neo-Taoism"" should be excluded or get its own group (what Imean by this is ""Humpty-Dumpty Taoism"", in which Taoism means whatever a poster says it means.) This ""alt.taoism"" could also be a refuge for debates about what ""Taoism *REALLY* means"" or speculations on sexualalchemy, etc..e.g. (from Thyagi again):Kent gloomily predicts (quoting from Thyagi's article):I think that discussions of this nature are not completely out ofplace. What's happening is that that the term ""Taoism"" is becomingcompletely polluted and trivialized like the words ""magic"", ""Alchemy"", ""Zen,"" etc., by writers appropriating the word to mean whatever they want. This is seen by the spate of new age books entitled ""TheTao of"" this, that, and everything else. (With respect to some exceptionslike the books by Jou, Tsung-Hwa.)Any other comments/ideas? I look forward to seeing them. On balance,I say let misc.taoism rip and let the chips fall where they may.

As published in ""US Industrial Outlook 1993"" (which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M.    In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had shown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7 satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to $450 M, future sales will be ""adversely affected by the downward revision in Department of Defense launch plans.""                              Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%).

In general, not a bad report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth $100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very successful in regaining international market share in the satellite business.    Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually publishes a listing of  ""Space Business Indicators"" in mid-year, and the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the numbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth.    Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top $3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year through the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive as currently projected.)    It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] 2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract.    The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although details of the launch services contract were reported to be negotiation, and not yet final.    The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  Under this contract the USAF can also request ""launch on demand"" services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to occur within 40 days of the request.     [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should provide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping MDC as a viable commerical launch company.     However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these contracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year.    Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III program in favor of the USAF NLS/""Spacelifter"" program.  At this time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and Congress propose cancellation of all ""ELV upgrade"" programs (including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed ""Spacelifter"" program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to find in the shrinking US Defense budget.]  3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC ""GO-AHEAD""   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of Commerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral images of the Earth.    [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new venture as a ""Star Wars"" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable customers for this service include exploration geologists, agricultural planners, and urban planners.     It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the 1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices.    There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote sensing ventures working their way through the system at different stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures appearing in the next year or so.]                  4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ ""STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT""    Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General Dynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent analyst's report Morgan Stanley said ""We are more than ever convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical 95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-generating unit.""  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and $100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market.    [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has hurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, many market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected to be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur program is back on track, this division will continue to show substantial losses.    In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  In GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction (Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the $700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of change for any company.]  5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the next decade.    Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14 contracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts.    Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can compete are projected to come from communications satellites with the remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region.    Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with larger communications payloads carrying more transponders. Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications satellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to about 3000 kg in GEO.    Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing or near-term transponders.    One of the significant possible changes in the market was identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal.    [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.  Comparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical transponders on orbit.   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability service, but only from established point A to established point B. To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable between the points, and while there are improved network solutions, installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost millions or billions of dollars.     For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to handle the increase in traffic.    Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from last generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite launches over longer intervals.    And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it looks like the space transportation market will be rather over-supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, Japan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per year.  That's a lot of capability for a small market.    We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial launches.]6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT    The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation of range safety rules.     In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the valid abort call.    Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed.    Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used in the launch.   [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested by the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.     At the time of writing this column, some of the initial investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four different communications channels were in use during the test. After the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the best set being that clear lines of communications and clear definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and understanding of the mission rules were not established before the launch.     As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they do with commercial aircraft problems).     I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how specific lines of authority should be delineated.] 7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the ""Aerokosmos"" winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the ""Severkosmos"", launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called 'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow.    [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union.    This one's a little different in that they are offering variants of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being targeted or substantial financial backing.]8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses.    [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected returns were too low to justify the cost of development.     This might point out some key discriminators in judging the feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage sufficient to recover setup costs?  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the investment?     Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush authorized space technology transfer for several joint space ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in development funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor launch vehicle as well as from the US.    [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.  However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on system).     This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to find any other European development work with even a rumor of funding for hardware.    Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled the country in the 1970's and early 1980's.    What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq in the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package lagged that of the propulsion system.    It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B satellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has yet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this contract.] 10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2 launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as ""the main alternative rocket supplier"" for the small satellite launch service to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the Swedish satellite was not specified.    [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From PacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series rockets are built of ""off the shelf"" components based upon the Lunar MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a 225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.     PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and 2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the board of directors.     PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least $550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to design, build and launch their first set of vehicles.    The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real hardware.] 11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the satellite's communications channels.     [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 M) through 2006.     I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two separate sastellite ventures.    The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is ""Asiasat-2"", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing Hong Kong-based ""Asiasat"" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to proceed.    In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This is just another indicator to add to the list.] 12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES   South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by 1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's aerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by 2000.                                    [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its national aerospace industry, specifically including space activities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are coming into the commercial space market.    As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea.    South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US $8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely ""made in Korea.""  Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-monitoring micro-satellite.    This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with optical and microwave sensors.   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel military effort to establish the capabilities for building and launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a government panel had been established to oversee such an effort, funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the Korean peninsula.          In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has announced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).     This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition of commercial space market there over the next decade.] 13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH   As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite well, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its results in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....

"Most of you will have probably seen the news by the time you read this,but the Branch Davidian compound is no more.  This morning about 6:00,the feds punched holes in the compound walls by using a tank.  They then started using non-lethal tear gas.  Shortly after noon, 2 cultmembers were seen setting fire to the compound.  So far, about 20-30people have been seen outside the compound.  The fate of the other 60 or70 people is unknown, neither is the fate of the 17 children that wereinside.

For a non-UPS (truck) package, they quoted a rate	of $85. Fed Ex economy air was only $85 for the	same weight! RPS (a trucking package company, in many	cities) only wanted $18. Guess who got it. The Mailbox	operator told me I was not telling the truth about	competitors' rates, said RPS was unreliable (I've used them	before with NO problems), etc. Right.	A COD check goes to the mailing service. Our local	Mailbox then takes its sweet time mailing me the	remade check. All this for an additional $3.00 over the	UPS COD charge. What a deal.... :-)	For packages over $100, they charge you about double over	what UPS charges them for insurance. I've never had	a claim, but other netters (is Ralph Seguin out there?)	have told horror stories about them...	All package traces have to be done through Mailbox by	Mailbox.	Our local Mailbox operator told me I was lying when I	asked him why their rates were stratospheric compared	to direct UPS. Does he ever check? Probably not...

Investigation showed that some Xservers will happily return any size up to the size of the root window, whileothers return some fixed limit of more reasonable size. The interesting thingto me is that the same server binary acts differently on different hardware -a Sun4 with a cg2 will claim cursors up to root window size are OK, while aSun4 with a cg6 will stop at 32x32. So far I've also seen this behavior onNCD and Phase-X X terminals and have been told it also occurs on HPs.

You may ask me for anything in my name, andI will do it."" (John 14:12-14)So, Jesus asked them to pray for things in his name.  Since that time,the request has been the same, not to ask for intercession from otherbeings, but from Jesus.  Remember that ""there is one God and onemediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself asa ransom for all men--the testimony given in its proper time."" (1Timothy 2:5-6.

"Not acceptable. Syria and Lebanon have a right to determine ifthey wish to return to the situation prior to the French invasionwhere they were both part of the same ""mandate territory"" - readcolony.Israel has no right to determine what happens in Lebanon. Invading anothercountry because you consider them a threat is precisely the way that almostall wars of aggression have started.Again territorial expansion by force.The UN defines them as occupied. They are recognised as such by everynation on earth (excluding one small caribean island).So the Adam thinks that peace is possible with continued occupation and a continued military presence? That is a completely unsustainable situationbecause the USA is bankrupt and simply cannot afford to finance theIsraeli ecconomy any more. There is no money for such an occupation.They were moved in as part of a deliberate policy to prevent the returnof the occupied territories. Machiavelli described the reasoning in thePrince. The clear intention was to create a constituency which the Likudbeleived could not be deprived of the land stolen from the indigenouspopulation.The pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the redefinition of much land used in common as ""public land"". The assertionthat the village common on which the village depends for food belongs toan invader simply because no individual has title is clearly anexcuse. When the land is used to build a condominium for aliens broughtin to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of theGeneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territoriesmust not be changed. No amount of self justifying on the part of Likud and hard linner appologistswill change the fact that the majority of world governments, and all ofthose that actually have any power have condemned this practice.Theyu also are a liability. We are talking about civilian encampments thatwould last no more than hours against tanks,Don't fool yourself. It was the gulf war that brought the Israelis to thenegotiating table. Once their US backers had a secure base in the gulfthey insrtructed Shamir to negotiate or else.If the creation of settlements had gone on any longer the USA would havecut the money supply.Not at all. They can chose to live in an arab state or return to Israel.The existence of a comunity does not give the right for another countryto annexe territory, not in Bosnia, not in the West Bank.Unless the new boundaries drawn up are those of 48 there will be no peace.Araffat has precious little authority to agree to anything else.The real issue is not the land treaty but the trade treaty. Since thePalestinians will remain heavily dependent on Israel indefinitely itis this that will be the guarantor of peace. another factor will be thereturn of lands confiscated by the Israeli state within Israel and thedismantling of the shadow structures which allow discrimination againstnon-Jews within what is nominaly a secular state. The irony is that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state hasa non descrimination law in order to protect the remaining settlers theIsraeli state is going to be forced inot the same position. This will meanoutlawing of discrimination such as that which prevents arabs from buyingor using much of the land.",9

Look, this system does nothing to threaten folks who _know_ they'rebeing wiretapped, since it's trivial to find other avenues of communication;they'd have no reason to resort to extreme measures, since a plethora ofsimple alternatives are easily available to them.    Among all the legitimate reasons to damn the proposed system, I don'tthink we need to worry about terrorist commie drug warlord assasin thugsmurdering our families, kicking the dog and leaving the toilet seat up justto steal a $15 telephone.  The system is more like urine testing:  itcatches some small number of very stupid people, has no effect on the ""badguys"" with at least three neurons working in unison who wish to subvert it,and penalizes most heavily those who have no cause to be subject to it.",3

"Perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then.  To me,an absolute is something that is constant across time, culture,situations, etc.  True in every instance possible.  Do you agreewith this definition?  I think you do:A simple example:In the New Testament (sorry I don't have a Bible at work, and can'tprovide a reference), women are instructed to be silent and covertheir heads in church.  Now, this is scripture.  By your definition, this is truth and therefore absolute.  Do women in your church speak?  Do they cover their heads?  If all scripture is absolute truth, it seems to me that women speaking in and coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals.  Yet, clearly, women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare heads.  (At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew up in.)Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.)Can you reconcile this?I don't claim that there are *no* absolutes.  I think there are veryfew, though, and determining absolutes is difficult.But you are claiming that all of Scripture is absolute.  How can youdetermine absolutes derived from Scripture when you can't agree howto interpret the Scripture?  It's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based on your own *interpretation* is absolute.  Do you deny that your ownbackground, education, prejudices, etc. come into play when you read the Bible, and determine how to interpret a passsage?  Do you deny that you in fact interpret?",7

"> be the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no > materials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids > and comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low > grade fusion reactors.I don't know what a ""low grade"" fusion reactor is, but the majorproblem with 3He (aside from the difficulty in making any fusionreactor work) is that its concentration in lunar regolith is just sosmall -- on the order of 5 ppb or so, on average (more in somefractions, but still very small).  Massive amounts of regolith wouldhave to be processed.This thread reminds me of Wingo's claims some time ago about the moonas a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasn'tcontent with being assured that titanium (at .5% in the Earth's crust,average) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though themarket price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound.This prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.On the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; ""high-Ti"" basalts (Apollo 11and 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice, but...terrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched intitanium.  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, andsometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are*enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over theworld (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  Ifeven 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2at concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Tibasalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the mooncould be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of theore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores beingmined today).",6

"I too have been watching the IIsi speedup reports and plan to upgrade inthe next few weeks.  The plan I have is to build a small board with a fewdifferent crystals on it and to be able to switch between the differentspeeds using a front pannel switch.  This way I can get the speed whenI want but I can also run at slower (stock) speeds it I experience anycompatability problems with any applications.  I don't expect to be ableto switch clock speeds with the system running, but if I can switchwithout any lock-up problems, then I could switch to 33MHz when neededand put it back to idle (20 MHz) when not needeed.  This would furtherreduce the wear-and-tear on the CPU even with a heat sink.  Of courseI would not want to run the different clock signals through the switchbut use a chip or two on the board to select the frequency desired androute it directly to the mother board.I haven't started probing around inside my si yet.

"[More stuff deleted]This seems to be a pretty arogant definition of belief.  My beliefsare those things which I find to be true based on my experience of theworld.  This experience includes study of things that I may not haveexperienced directly.  But even then, I can only understand thestudies to the extent to which I can relate what I study back to whatI have experienced.Which means that by beliefs about God are directly related to myexperience of God.  Having experienced God, I try to make sense ofthat experience.  I study religion and read the Bible.  I find thingsthat echo what I have already experienced.  Out of this I build mybeliefs.  I also find things that don't match my experience.  Thatdoesn't make them false.  They just don't match my experience.  MaybeI will understand that stuff later.  I don't know.  Maybe all of mybeliefs are wrong.  I can change my beliefs.If someone else has beliefs that are different from mine, so what.Neither of us are necessarily wrong.  Someone else is making sense outof a different set of experiences.  Even though we have differentexplanations and beliefs, if we talk we might even discover that theunderlying experiences are similar.Some people approach religion as a truth that can only exist in oneform, and usually has a single revelation.  The more dogmatic andinflexible the belief system, the more arrogant it will appear to anoutsider.  There is another approach possible, however.  God is amystery.  I am trying to solve the mystery, so I look at the evidenceavailable to me.  I try to arrive at the best understanding that I canbased on the evidence.  New evidence may cause me to change myunderstanding.  When I encounter someone with a different belief thanmy own, it isn't a threat, it is an opportunity to perhaps discoversomething new about this mystery I can never fully comprehend.PeaceWill Taber----------------------------------------------------------------------------",7

"This (frayed) thread has turned into a patented alt.atheism 5-on-1ping-pong game, and I don't have any strong disagreement, so I'll tryto stick to the one thing I don't quite follow about the argument:It seems to me that there is a contradiction in arguing that the Biblewas ""enlightened for its times"" (i.e. closer to what we would considermorally good based on our standards and past experience) on the onehand [I hope this summarizes this argument adequately], and on theother hand:}|> }Disclaimer:  I'm speaking from the Jewish perspective,}|> }where ""the Bible"" means what many call the Old Testament,}|> }and where the interpretation is not necessarily the}|> }raw text, but instead the court cases, commentaries}|> }and traditions passed down through Jewish communities.}|> }|> This seems the crux to me: if you judge the Bible according to a long}|> line of traditions and interpretations coming down to the current day,}|> rather than on its own merits as a cultural artifact, then of course}|> it will correspond more closely with more contemporary values.}}But if that's how the Bible is actually being used today,}shouldn't that be how we should judge it?  If most people}use scissors to cut paper, shouldn't Consumer's Reports}test scissors for paper-cutting ability, even though}scissors may have been designed originally to cut cloth?That's possibly a good way to judge the use of the Bible in teachingJewish morality today, but it hardly seems fair to claim that thishighly-interpreted version is what was ""enlightened for its times"".To (attempt to) extend the analogy, this is like saying that theoriginal scissor-makers were unusually advanced at paper-cutting fortheir times, even though they only ever cut cloth, and had never evenheard of paper.I'm not arguing that the Bible is ""disgusting"", though some of thehistory depicted in it is, by modern standards.  However, history isfull of similar abuses, and I don't think the Biblical accounts areworse than their contemporaries--or possibly ours.  On the other hand,I don't know of any reason to think the history described in the Bibleshows *less* abuse than their contemporaries, or ours.  That complexand benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythicinterpretations of that history is interesting, but I still don'tthink it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use itto attack condemnation of the original history.",0

"I've been thinking about the idea that was raised (by Michael Covington, I think) that words mean what we think they mean, regardless of etymology.  I've been reflecting on what certain words meant in my childhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes. I grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very angry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It carried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some time to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ' and `Christian'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To become a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would consider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared to pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a better bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable riches of knowing Christ.As it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that they were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time they had decided it wasn't a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They didn't disown me but they didn't completely accept the situation either.  For example, they didn't come to my wedding because it was in a church.   When I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her death, she said to me, ""As far as I'm concerned, you still are a Jew."" What she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a Jew.  I am a Christian.  (I'll concede, one that likes chicken soup with matzoh balls.:-)) I do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My sons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who do consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people Jews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.This is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their experience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while following Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.  I am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.  It was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have a sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small sacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it and do not want to ask for it back.And while I don't have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.  I am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the Church.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is that it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again, being rooted in the past. This is probably one of the reasons why I don't like it when people mess around with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of Easter).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.I suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn't assume that all believers of Jewish background are the same.  For some `Jewish Christian' is a good name, for others it is an oxymoron.",7

"I am working on a project to provide an emergency managementinformation system.  In keeping with more classic command andcontrol type systems, we are considering developing a dual screen monitorsystem in order to provide a status board on it's own monitor.  I have a number of X level questions regarding this:(We are devloping on Unix systems using X/Motif. Platform will be predominantly Sun's, probably with ports to RS/6000 as well).I am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configuredsuch that we are talking about one X display and multiple screens,and not multiple X displays.   Given this:	- Is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple	as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other?  There's	nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between	screens?	- Do I have to run separate window managers on the separate	screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there?	What are they; who sells them...	- Is a multi-screen window manager the only way I can grab a	window frame and move a window from one screen to the next?	- Is there any way for the application to transparently see	multiple screens as one logical x-y plane, or does the hardware	only provide for each screen to start at 0,0?	- Any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a	system capable of using either multiple screens or a single	screen (perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate	multiple screens instead)?  	I am assuming that this is not a major issue - that I can rely	on providing config files which will specify for each	configuration the screen placement of each window in the	application.

But one obvious reasonwhy Jesus died, (and as with everything else, it has nothing do withhis punishment) was that he could rise to life again--so thatwe would ""stop doubting and believe"" (John 21:27).  The factthat Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will risefrom the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it.Without this obvious point, I would have no hopeand my faith would be vanity.Why did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesussays why in John 15:18-25.

"We here at Utah State University Cooperative Extension have been usingW4Wg for a while now.  We wanted to talk to the internet with the mailpackage so we got the smtp gateway.  You also need a tcp/ip transportpackage on top of that which is utterly stupid but that's what theyrequire to get the smtp gateway to work.  You need a dedicated pcfor the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need anotherdedicated pc for the remote mail stuff.  We do not have the remote mailgoing but you indicate that that is what you want to do.  There is a glitch somewhere in the system though.  I don't know if itis MS mail, the gateway or the VAX here on campus that is choking in themail that is sent.  The scenario is this.  The outgoing mail goes to aUnix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go.  If that mailis routed to the VAX, the VAX has problems some times receiving the mail.Most messages do get through this way except if someone has there mailon the VAX forwarded to some other location.  That is the main gotcha.Where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message headerthen a message saying ""Boudary:= (error garbage code stuff)"".  If youcan stay away from sending to a VAX you are ok.  The system peopleof course say that the VAX is not the problem, the gateway is probablythe problem.

"A word of warning, though:  Kryptonite also sells almost useless cablelocks under the Kryptonite name.When I obtained my second motorcycle, I migrated one of my Kryptonite U-locks from my bicycle to the new bike.

After less than a week, I took it back indisgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name U-lock.First, the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite, is not covered bythe Kryptonite guarantee, and doesn't even approach Kryptonite standards ofquality and quality assurance.  It is just some generic made-in-Taiwan cablelock with the Kryptonite name on it.Secondly, the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke.  Idon't know if mine was a particularly poor example, but it was oftenquite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage, and sometimesit would seem to engage, only to fall open when I went to unlock it.Thirdly, the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which servesthe sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the dark.  I didn't try it (obviously), but I have my doubts that the lock mechanism would stand up to an ""insert screwdriver and TORQUE""attack.Fourthly, the cable was not, in my opinion, of sufficient thickness to deter theft (for my piece of crap bicycle, that is).

If a patient who requires extensivecare shows up at the last minute, we always see them and give them appropriatecare. It is reasonable for a clinic to refuse to see patients outside of itsposted hours, but what you describe is misbehavior. Ask to speak to theclinic director, and complain. Whatever their attitude, they have nothing togain from angering patients.",5

"I'm a biker and a dog-lover.First and foremost, I want to mention some common sense.  If it's a choicebetween injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there isonly one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would putthe dog first.Second, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you reactto a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you'replaying with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog whichhas hostile intent.Third, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are socialbeasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there aretwo types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that whichdominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of thelatter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible.But God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and mayeven on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy ohrapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!Now, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea toassume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's agame, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one;when you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place ofinterception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle sothat when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds toreact to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that amotorcycle is capable of.With a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measuresmay be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important-- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on theroad, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled upnewspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that willhurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude isthat you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  Thelarger the dog, the greater your anger.Dogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and heare not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps heis on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.Most dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territorywhere there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you aresatisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escapedpunishment.",18
": I: |> Jim,: |> : |> I always thought that homophobe was only a word used at Act UP: |> rallies, I didn't beleive real people used it. Let's see if we agree: |> on the term's definition. A homophobe is one who actively and: |> militantly attacks homosexuals because he is actually a latent: |> homosexual who uses his hostility to conceal his true orientation.: |> Since everyone who disapproves of or condemns homosexuality is a: |> homophobe (your implication is clear), it must necessarily follow that: |> all men are latent homosexuals or bisexual at the very least.: |> : : Crap crap crap crap crap.  A definition of any type of 'phobe comes from: phobia = an irrational fear of.  Hence a homophobe (not only in ACT UP meetings,: the word is apparently in general use now.  Or perhaps it isn't in the bible?  : Wouldst thou prefer if I were to communicate with thou in bilespeak?): : Does an arachnophobe have an irrational fear of being a spider?  Does an: agoraphobe have an irrational fear of being a wide open space?  Do you: understand English?: : Obviously someone who has  phobia will react to it.  They will do their best: to avoid it and if that is not possible they will either strike out or: run away.  Or do gaybashings occur because of natural processes?  People: who definately have homophobia will either run away from gay people or: cause them (or themselves) violence.: Isn't that what I said ...What are you taking issue with here, your remarks are merelyparenthetical to mine and add nothing useful.: [...]: : |> It would seem odd if homosexuality had any evolutionary function: |> (other than limiting population growth) since evolution only occurs: |> when the members of one generation pass along their traits to: |> subsequent generations. Homosexuality is an evolutionary deadend. If I: |> take your usage of the term, homophobe, in the sense you seem to: |> intend, then all men are really homosexual and evolution of our: |> species at least, is going nowhere.: |> : : So *every* time a man has sex with a woman they intend to produce children?: Hmm...no wonder the world is overpopulated.  Obviously you keep to the: Monty Python song:  ""Every sperm is sacred"".  And if, as *you* say, it has: a purpose as a means to limit population growth then it is, by your own : arguement, natural.Consider the context, I'm talking about an evolutionary function. Oneof the most basic requirements of evolution is that members of aspecies procreate, those who don't have no purpose in that context.: : |> Another point is that if the offspring of each generation is to: |> survive, the participation of both parents is necessary - a family must: |> exist, since homosexuals do not reproduce, they cannot constitute a: |> family. Since the majority of humankind is part of a family,: |> homosexuality is an evolutionary abberation, contrary to nature if you: |> will.: |> : : Well if that is true, by your own arguements homosexuals would have : vanished *years* ago due to non-procreation.  Also the parent from single: parent families should put the babies out in the cold now, cos they must,: by your arguement, die.By your argument, homosexuality is genetically determined. As to yoursecond point, you prove again that you have no idea what contextmeans. I am talking about evolution, the preservation of the species,the fundamental premise of the whole process.: : |> But it gets worse. Since the overwhelming majority of people actually: |> -prefer- a heterosexual relationship, homosexuality is a social: |> abberation as well. The homosexual eschews the biological imperative: |> to reproduce and then the social imperative to form and participate in: |> the most fundamental social element, the family. But wait, there's: |> more.: |> : : Read the above.  I expect you to have at least ten children by now, with: the family growing.  These days sex is less to do with procreation (admittedly: without it there would be no-one) but more to do with pleasure.  In pre-pill: and pre-condom days, if you had sex there was the chance of producing children.: These days is just ain't true!  People can decide whether or not to have : children and when.  Soon they will be able to choose it's sex &c (but that's : another arguement...) so it's more of a ""lifestyle"" decision.  Again by: your arguement, since homosexuals can not (or choose not) to reproduce they must: be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children.  Both are : as ""unnatural"" as each other.Yet another non-sequitur. Sex is an evolutionary function that existsfor procreation, that it is also recreation is incidental. Thathomosexuals don't procreate means that sex is -only- recreation andnothing more; they serve no -evolutionary- purpose.: : |> Since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some: |> policy makers that they have civil rights, they are now claiming that: |> their sexuality is a preference, a life-style, an orientation, a: |> choice that should be protected by law. Now if homosexuality is a mere: |> choice and if it is both contrary to nature and anti-social, then it: |> is a perverse choice; they have even less credibility than before they: |> became prominent. : |> : : People are people are people.  Who are you to tell anyone else how to live: their life?  Are you god(tm)?  If so, fancy a date?Here's pretty obvious dodge, do you really think you've said anythingor do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement? I am nottelling anyone anything, I am demonstrating that there are argumentsagainst the practice of homosexuality (providing it's a merely analternate lifestlye) that are not homophobic, that one can reasonablycall it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand. I realizeof course that this comes dangerously close to establishing  a value,and that atheists are compelled to object on that basis, but if youare to be consistent, you have no case in this regard.: : |> To characterize any opposition to homosexuality as homophobic is to: |> ignore some very compelling arguments against the legitimization of: |> the homosexual ""life-style"". But since the charge is only intended to: |> intimidate, it's really just demogoguery and not to be taken: |> seriously. Fact is, Jim, there are far more persuasive arguments for: |> suppressing homosexuality than those given, but consider this a start.: |> : : Again crap.  All your arguments are based on outdated ideals.  Likewise the: bible.  Would any honest Christian condemn the ten generations spawned by: a ""bastard"" to eternal damnation?  Or someone who crushes his penis (either: accidently or not..!).  Both are in Deuteronomy.I'm sure your comment pertains to something, but you've disguised itso well I can't see what. Where did I mention ideals, out-dated orotherwise? Your arguments are very reactionary; do you have anythingat all to contribute?: : |> As to why homosexuals should be excluded from participation in: |> scouting, the reasons are the same as those used to restrict them from: |> teaching; by their own logic, homosexuals are deviates, social and: |> biological. Since any adult is a role model for a child, it is: |> incumbent on the parent to ensure that the child be isolated from: |> those who would do the child harm. In this case, harm means primarily: |> social, though that could be extended easily enough.: |> : |> : : You show me *anyone* who has sex in a way that everyone would describe as: normal, and will take of my hat (Puma baseball cap) to you.  ""One man's meat: is another man's poison""!: What has this got to do with anything?

"The IIvx...LCIII performance at a Centris 610 price. The only reasonto get an IIvx is if you really need the full-size Nubus slots. Keep in mind that the 610 supports all Apple monitors and has optional Ethernet.This lessens (but doesn't eliminate) the need for Nubus cards. And unlessyou're running FPU-intensive software, the 610 will blow the doors off theLCIII and the IIvx. The LCIII, on the other hand, is sufficient for mostpeople and has a great price.If you haven't guessed, I find halving the bus clock (the IIvx 32MHz uP vs.16MHz bus) a throughly bad thing and I hope Apple never does it again.-- ______________________________________________________________________________",14

"DEPOSITION of VITALY NIKOLAYEVICH DANIELIAN [1]          Born 1972          Attended 9th Grade          Middle School No. 17          Resident at Building 4/2, Apartment 25          Microdistrict No. 3          Sumgait [Azerbaijan]Really, people in town didn't know what was happening on February 27. I came home from school at 12 o'clock, being excused to leave before the last period in order to go to Baku. When we left, everything in town was fine. Life was the same as usual, a few groups of people were discussing things, soccer and other things. Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my first cousin's birthday, my father, my mother, and I. We spent the day in Baku, and on the 28th, somewhere around 6:00 p.m., we got on the bus for home, figuring that I'd have enough time to do my homework for the next day.When we were entering town, near the 12-story high-rises, our bus was stopped by a very large crowd. The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the bus. The driver says that there are no Armenians on board; then everyone on the busbegins to shout that there are no Armenians on board. The group comes up to the doors of the bus and has people get out one by one, not checking passports, just going by the way people look. We get off the bus, but are not taken for Armenians.We set out in the direction of home. At first we were going to go into an old building where we knew there'd be a place to hide, but the whole road was packed with groups of people, all the way from Block 41 to the 8th Microdistrict. These groups were emptying people's pockets and checkingpassports. People who didn't have passports with them were beaten as well.Then we decided to go home instead. Near the 12-story high-rises I saw burningcars and a great many people standing around the driveways, yelling. ""Death tothe Armenians"" was written on the cars.When we came into the courtyard--we live in an L-shaped building--it was stillquiet. We went on upstairs, but didn't turn on any lights. We tried to call Baku to warn our relatives, who were due to arrive on Wednesday, not to come. Then there was a knock at the door. It was our neighbors, who advised us to come down to stay at their place. We went down to their place, and they led usto the basement. They live on the first floor and have a basement which you enter across the balcony. We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman was beaten--she ran away naked. Our neighbors' daughter said that that's right, that's what the Armenians deserve, because in Stepanakert, allegedly, people were being killed, 11 girls from Agdam had been raped. We didn't stay very long in the basement. We tried to support one another as best we could, looking out the small window with the iron grating. Papa watched and said things now and then. He said that there was a fire near Building 5, probably acar on fire. Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that they be shown the apartments where Armenians lived. The neighbors said that there weren't any Armenians here, and the group set out for the other wing of the building. They appeared from the 5/2 side of the building, where, I later found out, a woman had been murdered. The woman who ran away naked died. YuriAvakian was killed, too.When the crowd left, the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go home. We went back up to our place and again didn't turn on the light. We started to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while. Wetried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait, but there was no answer. Wedecided she had already left.We sat at home. The phone rang, and the caller asked to speak with myfather. I called him to the phone. It was Jeykhun Mamedov, from my father'swork brigade. He said he was disgusted by what was happening in ourtown. He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us getout of the city. To be quite honest, Papa didn't want to give him our address,but my mother got on the phone and told him. Some 15 minutes after thecall a crowd ran into our entryway. Bursting into the building, they brokedown the door and came into the apartment . . .They came straight to our apartment, they knew exactly where the Armenians were. They came into our place. We tried to resist, but there was nothing we could do. One of them took my parents' passports and began to read them. He read the surname ""Danielian,"" turned the page, read ""Armenian,"" and that alonewas enough to doom us. He said that we should be moved quickly out into the courtyard, where they would have done with us. Another, standing next to him, pushed some of the keys on the piano and said ""your death has tolled."" They had knives and steel truncheons.I had a knife in my hand. Unfortunately, I didn't use it. I just knew that ifI didn't give up the knife things would be much worse. They struck my parents and said that I should put the knife on the piano. Then, one of them commandedthat we be taken outside. One person was giving orders. When we were taken outdoors I went in the middle, and my mother was behind me. Someone started topush her so she'd walk faster; I let her go ahead of me, and fell in behind her. When he tried to push me, I hit him, and at that moment they began beating my parents; I realized that resistance was completely useless.We are taken out into the courtyard, and the neighbors are standing on their balconies to see what will happen next. The crowd surrounds us. At first they strike me, and I'm knocked out; when I come to, they beat me again . . . I lose consciousness often . . . I don't see or hear my parents, since I was thefirst one hit and was out cold. When I come to I try to pick them up; they arelying next to me. The crowd is gone, the only people around are watching from their balconies. That's it. I try to pick them up, but can't. My left arm is broken. I start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call an ambulance. The bodies of my parents are still warm.We were attacked at around 9 o'clock. I regain consciousness at about 11 and try to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors' door, they push me back and tell me to go away. I go up to the third floor, our neighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; shesends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. I often look out the window to see if the ambulance has arrived, but I can't see very far as a result of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been taken away. Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken away, and everything will be OK.But they were still there. Later, at 8 in the morning as I found out, theambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. If they receivedattention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. Later, around 12 o'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with some ""assistants."" They call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives, and I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital. There they stitch the woundson my head and rebind my arm. At 3 o'clock I and the other Armenians who are in the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku.In my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people, all of themArmenians. The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians. The onlyAzerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events,before the 27th.Then I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku. I was there 38 days. When I was released, on the 40th day, I found out that my parents were dead. At first they told me that they were in Moscow being treated, but later I found out that they were dead. My father's older brother told me.My father's name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian. He was born in 1938. My mother, born in 1937, was Seda Osipovna Danielian. Papa worked at PMK-20, the leader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator.They were also beaten on the head. The coroner's report stated that theirheads were smashed open and bled profusely.At the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov, who had called. As it turned out later, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. He had called specifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address and dispatch the group. He knew the phone number, but didn't know the address.Before the events I had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on the phone, when he would ask to speak with my father. I knew him by name. He denies that I was the one who answered the phone, saying that my father answered it. He denies that he called from a public phone, saying that he called from home, which also isn't true. I heard noise and the sounds of automobiles. As I later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but had never served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. He was about 20 years old. I don't know if he has since confessed or not. I am sure that he was the one who tipped the crowd off. One-hundred percent sure.My parents were from Karabagh. Father was from the village of Badar, and was two years old when his family moved to Baku, where his elder brothers were togo to school. He was a student at the Naval School, but never graduated. Hewent off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agricultural projects instituted under Khrushchev.] When he returned he lived in Baku, and later moved to Sumgait, helping with the town's construction. Mamma was from the village of Dagdagan, also from Karabagh. She worked in Sumgait, first in a bookstore, and later, on a construction site.My sister is older than I. She lives with her husband here in Karabagh. Ialways loved my parents. That was why I went on to 9th grade, because itwas their dream that I would continue my studies. I finished 8th grade andwanted to enter the Baku Nautical School, and after that, the MilitarySchool. But later I changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon-sider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join the Naval School. I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole lifelong--since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor. My father wanted itmore than anything. He always recollected his youth, telling of the School,and he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it.Now I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here. I will stay at the home of my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days.While in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who hadsuffered as well, like Ishkhan [Trdatov]. He managed to hold them off [attheir residence in Microdistrict 3, Building 6/2, Apartment 6.] for a longtime, lost his father [Gabriel], and by some miracle managed to survive. Ialso learned of Uncle Sasha, from Building 5/2, whose daughter was raped. . . Besides them, Valery--I forgot his last name--was in the hospital too,about a year younger than I, he went to School No. 14. He was riding withhis parents in the car. People were throwing rocks at them, he was hit, andhis parents brought him to the hospital, and he was in our ward. We evencame to be friends. Before that we had just seen each other around town. Butin the hospital we got to know one another better. I learned of the fates ofothers, those who had died, or who were befallen by misfortune . . .Today Suren Harutunian, the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia,was shown on television. To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed to recognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.I was repelled, no, revolted, to hear the Baku announcer who read the decisionof the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of Armenia.After the events in Sumgait and those in Baku, the best solution is to giveKarabagh to Armenia, return it to Armenia, since the people want to livepeacefully with the Azerbaijanis, but everything has to be right before theycan do that.I arrived in Karabagh on April 11. I felt very bad. I had constant headaches.After a while my strength returned. My older sister, Suzanna, took me in. I think that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due.You can't take away what is their due. My parents and I often spoke of NagornoKarabagh, often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. We had even decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia, we would move here for sure. We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much, and that what had been done in 1921--removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia--waswrong. Sooner or later, mistakes should be corrected. And in order to correct a mistake, it must not be repeated; and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh lies in the hands of our government.June 13,1988Stepanakert",9

"As a former Catholic and now as a very active Lutheran - it is some of the""innovations"" of the Mass which made me leave the Catholic Church and returnto the more traditional Catholic Chuch - the Lutherans.I spent many years as a Lector reading the Passion parts as appropriate inthe Catholic Church and I found it very meaningful.  Our Lutheran parish justinstituted the ""Tenebrae"" service for Good Friday and I was the lector for a paraphrased Passion which was exceptional.  I heard and learned thingsthat I have previously overlooked in the Gospels - yet those ""facts"" werealways there.  As a matter of interest, the pastor and I were talking aboutthe differences between the RC and Lutheran Church during Holy Week overbreakfast Easter Sunday.My wife is the member of the liturgy committee in the family (called musicand worship at our church).  Our pastor does have control of this committeebut listens very carefully to the committee's suggestions.  It needs a stronghand to lead and guide, to keep the intent and the message clear and strongas it should be through Lent and the rest of the liturgical year.  Additionalreason for my leaving the Catholic faith - lack of any selfless spiritualguidance by priests in my parishes.  AKA ""wishy-washy"". As you may gather from my comments, I feel that it is very important, ir-regardless of denominational guidelines, to have a service/Mass which promotesthe true reason that we are gathered there.  I am quite comfortable in atraditional Mass, with receiving Holy Communion on the tongue, the Sacramentof PENANCE (not Reconciliation), Stations of the Cross, so on and so forth.The reason other types of Masses and parishes exist is because these feelingsare not shared by everyone.I want more people to attend church and to find the Lord, but I don't want them attending a show.  It's not.  My church works hard to have a meaningfulservice during Lent on Wednesdays, but follow traditional Lutheran Book ofWorship guidelines.  Where things are changed or omitted during Lent (suchas the Hymn of Praise) it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that itis Not there.Quite frankly, it is very hard for a non-Catholic to go to a Mass and ""fit in"".My dear wife never could (former Methodist).  And Holy Week Masses and Vigilswould intimidate the daylights out of a non-Catholic.  Those Catholics whohave beared with me this far understand what I mean.Please keep in mind why we are there - to gather together in worship.  Notto worry about how something is done or not done.  If there is somethingwrong that you feel needs addressing, by all means talk to your priest orpastor.  I have only ever met one who wouldn't listen.  They are there to provide spiritual guidance and to help.  Use them.  My differences withthe Catholic Church are much more fundamental - but my decision to changefaiths was done with prayer, intervention, and sessions with priests andministers.In Christ,Kershner-- Kershner Wyattkwyatt@ccscola.ColumbiaSC.ncr.com",7

"I think the passage you're looking for is the following.Matthew 5:17    ""Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them. Matthew 5:18   For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. Matthew 5:19   Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. Matthew 5:20   For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. There are several problems with this.  The most serious is that theLaw was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, butnot on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all humanbeings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  Theissue that the Church had to face after Jesus' death was what to doabout Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not toimpose the Law on them didn't say that the Law was abolished.  Itsimply acknowledged that fact that it didn't apply to Gentiles.  Thisis a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to.(A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recordedin Acts 15.)However there's more involved.  In order to get a full picture of therole of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul's apparentrejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus' commendation ofthe Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves apurpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, thisissue isn't one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of hisdiscussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, andassures us that that's not what he intends to say.  Rather, he seesthe Law as primarily being present to convict people of theirsinfulness.  But ultimately it's an impossible standard, and one thathas been superceded by Christ.  Paul's comments are not the world'sclearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But theinteresting thing to notice is that even this radical position doesnot entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as anuncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.For its purpose of convicting of sin, it's important that it not berelaxed.  However for Christians, it's not the end -- ultimately welive in faith, not Law.While the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in theend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  Thequoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the restof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets theLaw.  The ""not an iota or dot"" would suggest a rather literal reading,but in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretationsemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonialdetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitudetowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewishdiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving atenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things thatreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups andplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people whouse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, andthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specificview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining theLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.Paul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law beingsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the""ceremonial law"", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quiteconcerned about maintaining moral standards.The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law beingsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believethey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul isembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in lettersresponding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of theLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewishceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standardsof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seemsto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals andhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were laterto give Paul so much trouble.",11

"And I maintain:Some people do not want to enter into the light and the knowledge thatthey alone are their own masters, because they fear it; they are tooafraid of having to face the world on their own terms.  And so, bytheir own choice, they will remain in darkness, sort of like bugsunder a rock.  However, some people, but not many, will not like thedarkness.  Sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable.These people will crawl out from under the rock, and, although blindedat first, will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth.  And,after a while, now that they can see things for what they really are,they will also see the heights which they can reach, and the placesthey can go, and they will learn to choose their own paths through theworld, and they will learn from their mistakes and revel in theirsuccesses.They will see that there is much much more to the world than just thenarrow experiences under the rock.

"Between Adam and Eve and Golgotha the whole process of the fall of manoccurred.  This involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritualworld.  This is discernable in the world outlooks of different peoples throughhistory.  The Greek, for example, could say, ""better a beggar in the landof the living than a king in the land of the dead."" (Iliad, I think).The question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ isan ever present one with Christians.  I am not ready to conscign Adamor Abraham, or even Cain to eternal damnation.  Yet they all died in theirsins, in the Christian sense.  The same can be said of the whole of  Gentilehumanity, and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next tohim.  I do not limit the power of Christ to save even him, through whomSatan would mock his deed of salvation at the very moment of its fulfillment.It is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment.  Therelationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitelyextended conditions of Greenwich mean time. It is possible to imaginean eternity of agony or bliss - or even many of them - in thespiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth.It was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteouswere lost. This again is the result of the loss of the paradisal consciousnessthat fled from us after the fall, with our ever increasing involvement withthe sense world.It would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancientpeople's ideas of life after death.Mankind fell into mist and darkness, and at ""the turning point oftime"" a new light entered into the world.  The light still grows, andwe are developing the eyes with which to see by it.  Much newrevelation and growth in under- standing lies before us.  Our newvision and understanding is still very feeble, but it containssomething new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old andmuch more as well.(At this point I should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of RudolfSteiner, founder of Anthroposophy, for  many insights that have led me to myviews on this subject).The way you refer to it as ""doctrine"" puts a modern intellectual coloringon it. I think it was much less abstract and much more real and spirituallyconcrete, a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines orteachings today can be received.I am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity tosimple dispersion from an original source.  Even if they were passedon, the question is, to what extent did they reflect real perceptionand experience?  The similarity in the midst of great variety ofexpression of the different people's ideas of the time immediatelyafter death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality.  Inany case, we study geometry not by reading old manuscripts of Euclid,but by contemplating the principles themselves.On the other hand, there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianitythat originated most definitely in a pagan source.  The idea that thehuman being consists essentially of soul only, and that the soul iscreated at birth, was consciously adopted from Aristotle, whose ideasdominated Christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still doestoday. He was at once the father of modern thought and at the sametime lived during that darkened time when the perception of oureternal spiritual being had grown dim.Indeed. I should also clarify that I do not deny that eternalirrevocable damnation is a real possibility.  But the narrow range inwhich we conceive of the decisive moment, i.e. after the end of asingle earthly life, is not in my mind sufficient to embrace thereality, and I think that is why the early creeds were couched interms that did not try to spell it out.",7

"Define perfect then.   Take your foot out of your mouth, I wondered about that already when Iwas a Catholic Christian. The fact that the contradiction is unresolvableis one of the reasons why I am an atheist. Believe me, I believed similar sentences for a long time. But that showsthe power of religion and not anything about its claims.   It follows from a definition of evil as ordinarily used. Letting evilhappen or allowing evil to take place, in this place even causing evil,is another evil.   The omniscient attribute of god will know what the creatures will do evenbefore the omnipotent has created them. There is no choice left. All is known,the course of events is fixed. Not even for the omniscient itself, to extend an argument by James Tims.   And when I am not omnipotent, how can I have free will? You have saidsomething about choices and the scenario gives them. Therefore we havewhat you define as free will. Imagine the following. I can do good to other beings, but I cannot harm them.Easily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of gooddeeds, but don't make them long for them, so they can not feel the absenceof good as evil. But whose case am I arguing? It is conceivable, so the omnipotent can do it.Or it would not be omnipotent. If you want logically consistent as well, youhave to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first.

"Koberg,	Just a couple of minor corrections here...	1)  The Churches of Christ do not usually believe in speaking intongues, in fact many of them are known for being strongly opposed toPentecostal teaching.  You are probably thinking of Church of God inChrist, the largest African-American Pentecostal denomination.	2)  I'm not sure what you mean by ""signifying believers""  but itshould be pointed out that the Assemblies of God does not now, nor has itever, held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a Christian. The doctrine that traditional Pentecostals (including the A/G) maintain isthat speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becominga Christian in which one is ""Baptized in the Holy Spirit""  That may bewhat you were referring to, but I point this out because Pentecostals arefrequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in orderto be a Christian.  Such a position is only held by some groups and not themajority of Pentecostals.   Many Pentecostals will quote the passage inMark 16 about ""these signs following them that believe"" but they generallydo not interpret this as meaning if you don't pactice the signs you aren't""saved"".	3)  I know it's hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement thathas such diversity, but I think you've made some pretty biggeneralizations here.  Do ""Neo-Pentecostals"" only believe in tongues as asign and tongues as prayer but NOT tongues as revelatory with a message? I've never heard of that before.  In fact I would have characterized themas believing the same as Pentecostals except less likely to see tongues asa sign of Spirit Baptism.  Also, while neo-Pentecostals may not beinclined to speak in tongues in the non-Pentecostal churches they attend,they do have their own meetings and, in many cases, a whole church will becharismatic.",7

"Why don't you just look it up in the Merk? Or check out the medical dictionarycite which a doctor mentioned earlier in this thread?Among others, see Olney's  ""Excitotoxic Food Aditives - Relevance ofAnimal Studies to Human Safety"" (1982) Neurobehav. Toxicol. Teratol.vol 6: 455-462.I'm sure PETA would love to hear your arguments.Whose talking about ""food science""? What is this comment supposed tomean? *Neurotoxicology and Tratology*, *Brain Research*, *Nature*,*Progress in Brain Research*: all fine food science journals. ;-)Then you would know that Olney himself has casually  referred to""Chinese Restaurant Syndrome"" in a few articles. Why don't *you* pointus to some studies? Maybe then this exchange could be productive.They're unable to metabolise it.Who said anything about 'received wisdom'? There is no question thatorally administered doses of MSG are capable of destroying nearly allneurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the medianeminence. These areas are responsible for the production ofhormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normaldevelopment of the vertabrate organism. Humans are vertebrates. Nowwhat, pray tell, do you think will happen when the area of the brainnecessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing?Are you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary,ANH, and ME, of that part of the brain that is responsible forcontrolling the realease (albeit indirectly) of estradiol and testosterone? How do you expect anyone to do the studies on this? It's unethical to""sacrifice"" humans to check out what effects chronic, acute, etc dosesof these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans.  The foodindustry knows this. That's why the animal model is used in medicineand psych.  If you're talking about straight sensitivity, it would beuseful to define the term.  There are plenty of studies onpsychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude andphysiology.I suspect we may be arguing about separate things; *only* adult sensitivities(You), and late-occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and itsimplication for adults (me).  Certainlythe doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger thanfor the young, but the additivity of Glu and Asp, and their copiousand increased presence in modern processed foods (jointly), and theirhidden presence in HVP, necessitates extreme caution. Why would anyonewant to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb theendocrine system in adults?  The main point is *blood levels*attained, and oral doses would likely have to be greater than SC. Olney's work provides a putative causal mechanism for somesensitivities. Terry, Epelbaum and Martin have shown that orallyadministered MSG causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormonefluctutations in adults. Glu also was found to induce immediate and persistantsupression of rhythmic GH secretion, and to induce rapid and transientrelease of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to MSG. GH isresponsible not only for control of growth during development, butalso converts glycogen into glucose. Could this be the cause ofheadaches? I don't know.",5

"I'd like to share my thoughts on this topic of ""arrogance ofChristians"" and look forward to any responses.  In myencounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by theirbelief that their faith is total truth.  According to them,their beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word ofGod and God is truth - thus they know the truth.  This stancemakes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my ownhesitations about Christianity because they see no other way.Their way is the 'truth.'But I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believea particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason,but it seems to me a choice.My discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyarddiscussions when I was in grade school:A kid would say, ""All policemen are jerks!""  I'd ask, ""How doyou know?""  ""Because my daddy told me so!""  ""How do you knowyou're daddy is right?""  ""He says he's always right!""Well the argument usually stops right there.  In the end,aren't we all just kids, groping for the truth?  If so, do we havethe authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own asfalse?-------------This is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup.  Iapologize if I'm covering tired old ground.  Some of thediscussions on this topic have piqued my interest and I welcomeany comments.-- [I'm sort of mystified about how a Christian might respond to this.  Ican understand criticisms of Christianity that say there's not enoughevidence to believe it, or that there's just as good evidence forother religions.  I don't agree, but clearly there are plenty ofintelligent people who don't find the evidence convincing.  But thatdoesn't seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people whobelieve Christianity is true also believe that things which contradictit are false.This suggests a model of spiritual things that's rather different thanthe Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, wherepeople choose what value to follow, but there's no actual independentspiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is insome unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications ofone sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  ButChristianity is in its essense a ""historical"" religion.  That is, it'sbased on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities outthere, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways,and that we see evidence of that in history.  In the ""mundane"" world,we are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, itfalls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesn't).  TheChristian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actualexternal reality.  I hope we're all honest enough not to claim that wehave perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we knoweverything, we are confident that we know some things.  And thatimplies that we think things that contradict them are false.  I don'tsee how else we could proceed.This needn't result in arrogance.  I'm certainly interested in talkingwith people of other religions.  They may have things to teach me, andeven if they don't, I respect them as fellow human beings.  But it'sgot to be possible to respect people and also think that on somematters they are wrong.

I'm selling it because I	now have a better printer.  This is the wide carriage version of the	KX-P1124, by the way.  Test prints are available upon request.	Price:  $250.00 o.b.o. or trade.	Excalibur custom pool cue.  19 oz., 13 mm, brass joint, Irish linen	wrap, could use a new tip but will hold up for a while.  I've got too	many cues as it is, and don't need this one.  Hits nicely, is very	straight and in excellent condition.	Price:  $125.00 o.b.o. or trade.  Imperial hard case (1 butt/1 shaft)	available for an additional $40.00.TRADES:  I need the following things, and I have no cash of my own right now,so if you want to trade, it needs to be straight-across.   The list:	Amiga ROM upgrade to at LEAST 2.04, preferably 2.1+, with appropriate	DOS and Workbench.	1 meg Agnus chip for the Amiga.	Amiga hard drive and controller (preferably SCSI).	IBM-compatible hard drive (and controller if not MFM).  This one's 	touchy, as I have a full-height and don't have room for more unless	I swap out--needs to be above 100M, and I will consider trading a	good ST-4096 in the deal.

"I have a 24-pin printer which is an ALPs Allegro24.  It's both a fastprinter with LQ and a very sophisticated design.  It has a straight paperpath and the capability of auto-forwarding sheets to tear off and then back(a big paper saver as you never have to waste sheets to get a currentprint out).  It can also handle single sheets without removing the formfeedand has sophisticated preferences options (you can interactively programall the preferences to control the printer and get printed feedback withoutever using a computer).  You get prompts and menus to pick your current setupand default set up.  This was THE top of the line LQ dot matrix when I boughtit three years ago for $399.  It is also Epson LQ2500 compatible (besides it'sown modes) and comes with IBM driver software (which I've never used since Iown an Amiga).  Has a card slot for upgrading memory or fonts.

"Request for opinions:	   Which is better - a one-piece Aerostitch or a two-piece Aerostitch?   We're looking for more than ""Well, the 2-pc is more versatile, but the    1-pc is better protection,...""	   Thanks in advance,   NadineWhat is best? Books have been written on that! But in regard toAeroStich it really depends on your particular size, shape and needs.If you upper and lower body are not proportional (according to aerodimensions) then it probably is going to be better mixing and matchingthe 2 piece suit. I have the 2 piece suit and I am very happy with it.Having my life quota of scars from crashing off road, I am veryconcerned with good protection and I believe that the difference inprotection between the 1 and 2 piece suits is almost negligible. Ithink the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of adifference. One thing that is nice about the 2 piece is if you gosomewhere and then want to walk around for a while (still with jacket)you can just detach and stow the pants. One thing to note is that Goldfine has problems getting a good fit formany women (with standard suits). Supposedly for smaller women (andpetite men for that matter) the 1 piece will fit better. Another recommendation is to pay for mods if you need them. I wish Igot 2-3 inches added to my pant legs. I find the Long suits are notreally that long (I can't imagine how short the standard suits mustbe).",18

"#Rick Anderson replied to my letter with...##ra> In article <C5ELp2.L0C@acsu.buffalo.edu>,#ra>(...)# Just briefly, on something that you mentioned in passing. You refer to# differing interpretations of ""create,"" and say that many Christians may# not agree. So what? That is really irrelevant. We do not base our faith# on how many people think one way or another, do we? The bottom line is# truth, regardless of popularity of opinions.It may be ""irrelevant"" to you and *your* personal beliefs (or should I say""bias""?), but it is relevant to me and many others.  You're right, ""thebottom line IS truth,"" independant from you or anyone else.  Since youproclaim ""truths"" as a self-proclaimed appointee, may I ask you by whatauthority you do this?  Because ""it says so in the Bible?""  --Does theBible ""say so,"" or is it YOU, or someone else, who interprets whether ascripture or doctrine conforms to your particular liking or ""disapproval""?Excuse moi, but your line of ""truths"" haven't moved me one bit to persuademe that my beliefs are erroneous.  Of all the ""preachers"" of ""truth"" onthis net, you have struck me as a self-righteous member of the wreckingcrew, with no positive message to me or other latter-day saints whatsoever.BTW, this entire discussion reminds me a lot of the things said by Jesusto the pharisees: ""ye hypocrite(s) . . . ye preach about me with your lips,but your hearts are far removed from me...""# Also, I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created# and eternally existent are equivalent, you say ""granted the Mormon# belief..."" You can't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to# have been addressed. In order to reply to the issue, you have to address# and answer the point that was raised, and not just jump to the# conclusion that you grant.Sophistry.  Look who's talking: ""jumping to conclusions?""  You wouldn't dothat yourself, right?  All YOU address is your own convictions, regardlesswhether we come up with any Biblical scriptures which supports our pointsof view, because you reject such interpretations without any considerationwhatsoever.## The Bible states that Lucifer was created.  The Bible states that Jesus# is the creator of all. The contradiction that we have is that the LDS# belief is that Jesus and Lucifer were the same.A beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentationof lds doctrine.  The former KGB would have loved to employ you.Jesus and lucifer are not ""the same,"" silly, and you know it.(...)# The Mormon belief is that all are children of God. Literally. There is# nothing symbolic about it. This however, contradicts what the Bible# says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God:Correction: it may contradict would YOU think the Bible says.  The Bibleindeed does teach that not all are children of God in the sense that they""belong to"" or follow God in His footsteps.  Satan and his followers haverebelled against God, and are not ""children (=followers/redeemed) of God,""but it doesn't mean that they were not once created by God, but chose toseparate themselves from those who chose to follow God and His plan ofsalvation.##        The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the#        kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked ""one"";#        (Matthew 13:38)kingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of Jesus(and have shown ""works of repentance, etc.), and the children of thewicked one are those who rebelled against God and the lamb.  The issueof satan's spirit-offspring (and those who followed him) has not beenaddressed in this and other verses you copied from your Bible.  Youpurposefully obscured the subject by swamping your ""right"" with non-related scriptures.(...lots of nice scriptures deleted (NOT Robert W. copyrighted) though...)#ra> > We are told that, ""And this is life eternal, that they might know#ra> > thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.""#ra> > (John 17:3).

First get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching to usabout ""the only true God,"" whom you interpret according to your own likesand dislikes, but whose image I cannot reconcile with what I know aboutHim myself.  I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for otherfaiths, believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ, but in a differentway or fashion than your own.  Not that it really matters, the missionand progress of the lds church will go on, boldly and nobly, and no mobor opponent can stop the work from progressing, until it has visitedevery continent, swept every clime, and sounded in every ear.#  This is really a red herring. It doesn't address any issue raised, but#  rather, it seeks to obfuscate. The fact that some groups try to read#  something into the Bible, doesn't change what the Bible teaches.Sigh.  ""What the Bible teaches""?  Or: ""what the bible teaches according toRobert Weiss and co.?""  I respect the former, I reject the latter withoutthe remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus.  On the contrary.  And bythe way, I do respect your interpretations of the Bible, I even grant youbeing a Christian (following your own image of Him), as much as I am aChristian (following my own image of Him in my heart).(...)#  Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of#  Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' I don't#  think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon. That is not the#  issue.  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this#  subject is the real issue. The indication from Rick is that they may#  certainly be.The issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis-represent or ridicule the lds church.  The issue of ""official doctrine""is obviously very important.  McConkie's views have been controversial(e.g. ""The Seven Deadly Heresies"" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best,or erroneous at worst (""blacks not to receive the priesthood in thisdispensation"").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuablecontribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personalinterpretations (his book ""Mormon Doctrine"" is oftentimes referred toas ""McConkie's Bible"" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I ratherlook to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books!(The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkiewas a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom ofGod than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepteddoctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation andspeculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his mostbiased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than thetrash coming from your proverbial pen.

"little.I know what you mean!  I glow everytime Ronnie's out on the ice.In fact, one of the neatest things about seeing the Pens in personis that I can key in on him instead of watching what I'd probablybe seeing on tv.  He does so many subtle things behind the play.He said in an interview recently that when he was a kid his dadstressed the importance of playing two-way hockey; that you have tolearn how to play defense as well as offense and he obviously tookthat advice to heart.  He was a breath of fresh air when he arrivedin Pittsburgh to the team whose forwards, for the most part, couldn'tand wouldn't play a lick of defense.It's really difficult to assess what the key trades were that broughtall of this success to the Pens.  You mention Rick Tocchet and he hascertainly helped, and even ol' Kjell has been steady.  But looking atthis team you could almost take any one of them out of the line-uppermanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and itwouldn't matter.If I had to pick the top three acquisitions in recent years they wouldbe 1) Tom Barrasso; 2) Ron Francis; 3) Larry Murphy.

"I am glad that you recognize that people should not engage in denialand repression, and should acknowledge such. The United States, withits people, have recognized that repression has taken place, with theloss and outright abrogation of civil liberties and constitutionalprotections of citizens. This recognition has taken the form of thecivil rights law (let's just discuss the federal level for now), suchas 18 USC 241 et. seq., 42 USC 1981 et. seq, et. al.   With this recognition of repression, at times manifested in theform of collective guilt, I want people to recognize denial. Though it can be said that white people numerically commit morecrimes in the United States, because white people are a majority,it can also be said that black people commit a disproportionateamount of crime in the United States, in their relation to theirnumbers in population.

Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360  array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for  every half degree longitude and latitude.   A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine  pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).  There's another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and  builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as  polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask  Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.  The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.  (was posted in comp.sources.unix).

Background imagery/textures/datafiles========================================= First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTPlist above.24-bit scanning:----------------  Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for  speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :  scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll  house supplies.  So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have  scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.Books with textures:--------------------  Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.  Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also  a wide variety of stock art is available.  Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,  UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.  In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books  for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your  graphics work. Their address is:	Edition Belvedere Co.

Introduction to rendering algorithms========================================a. Ray-Tracing:---------------  I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read  some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would  suggest:   An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press     1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4  Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong  using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines  (erich@eye.com)There's a more concise reference also:  Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: ""An Introduction to Ray Tracing"", in  ""Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD"", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,  NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer)--------------------------A good reference is:        _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,        McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.c.

The OFF data is triangles ata specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch).The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs atessellation at any specified resolution.b. Space Shuttle ?------------------Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttledatafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):model1:A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.)389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex).Payload doors non-existent.Units: unknown.Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy.

Image annotation software=============================a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a  rasterfile.b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not  sure exactly what they are.  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based  graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and  two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based  toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,  pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed  tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation  instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).  A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for  SPARC systems is also available for ftp.  All software is the property of Columbia University and may not  be redistributed without permission.  ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that  allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of  PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging  routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the   position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen   color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many  of the more popular image formats.

A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,  synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.  WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming  environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their  imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware  developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their  own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers  (specialized hardware).

This was  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL  or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general  purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a  freebie if you want it""  ""My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which  that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical  image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.)

SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets   comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars,   menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability   of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an   encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap   manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted  to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only   color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets   developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget   set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers   using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other   Motif widgets.  FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)   simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these  simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these  data graphically.   FVS accepts three-dimensional multi-block data recorded in NCSA HDF format. iti.gov.sg [192.122.132.130] : /pub/svlib (Scientific Visualization)      /pu/fvs; These directories contain demo binaries for Sun4/SGI  Cost : US$200 for academic and US$300 for non-academic institutions.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)===================================================GRASS-----  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,  although it is reported to have significant image processing  capabilities.  Feature Descriptions  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software."" A first review  of  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68  Host Configuration Requirements  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented  in raster (grid-cell) form.  Availability  CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.  This location will be the new ""canonical"" source for GRASS software, as  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and  ""tar"" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John  Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu  Support  Listserv mailing lists:  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in  Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the  community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,  we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass  through the list.  If you have questions, problems, or comments, send  E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.Microstation Imager-------------------  Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS  software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.  Feature Description  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available  for GIS applications.  Host Configuration Requirements  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.PCI---  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of  remote sensing data in eight or ten different ""industry standard""  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.  The ""PCI software"" consists of several classes/groups/packages of  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common ""PCI  database"" disk file.  The ""Tape I/O"" package is a set of utility  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the ""PCI database"" file;  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.  ""multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5""), and  God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't  use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your  particular application/interest calls for.  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight ""parameters,"" read from  a common ""parameter file"" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your ""default  directory.""  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI  data structures (database file, parameter file).  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the  Macintosh calls ""raw"") data from tape, in a number of different  ""interleave"" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the  graphic-arts industry's ""CT2T"" format, would probably (I haven't tried)  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start  over.  It's worth noting that the PCI ""database"" file is designed to  contain not only ""raster"" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this  can go into the PCI ""database"").  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would  display directly from a PCI ""database"" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be ""overkill""  in your case; it seems designed for the very ""high end""  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these  areas.SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)--------------------------------  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X  for display.MAP II------  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.CLRview-------  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports  the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,  TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.

"There is a way in which a multi-tasking computer actually gives youmore CPU power then you had before, and that is with I/O overlap.With I/O overlap, your CPU can continue to ""think"" while diskoperations are underway, whereas without overlap, your CPU sits idlywaiting for each disk operation to finish - and disk operations takean *eternity*, compared to a fast CPU.So, when you've got multi-tasking, you want to increase performance byincreasing the amount of overlapping you do.One way is with DMA or bus mastering.

"It was shafting on the part of the Arab land owners for doing it without notifying their tenant farmers and for not being responsible enough to make provisions for them, but rather just leavingthem to their fate.The point is that the land was sold legally, often at pricesabove its actual value.

"G-d has nothing to do with it. Some of the land was in fact given to the  Jews by the United Nations, quite a bit of it was purchased from Arab  absentee landlords. Present claims are based on prior ownership (purchase  from aforementioned absentee landlords) award by the United Nations in the  partition of the Palestine mandate territory, and as the result of  defensive wars fought against the Egyptians, Syrians, Jordanians, et al.***First, I should point out that many Jews do not in fact agree with the  idea that the West Bank is theirs. Since,  however, I agree with those who  claim the West Bank, I think I can answer your question thusly: the West  bank was what is called the spoils of war. Hussein ordered the Arab Legion  to attack Israel, which was a poor move, seeing as how the Israelis  promptly kicked his butt. The territory is therefore forefeit.  Retaining  possession of ALL of the West bank is  not desirable, but it beats  national suicide for the Israelis. Put another way, one could ask why it  is that so many Palestinians seem to think that Tel-Aviv belongs to them  and the future state of Palestine. As long as this state of affairs  continues, it seems that to give the Palestinians a place from which they  can launch attacks on Jews is a real poor idea. Giving up the entire West  Bank would be idiotic froma security standpoint.  In addition, there is  the small matter of Jerusalem, which is considered to be part of the West  Bank. The chances of the Israelis giving up Jerusalem are nil. Even  leftists who think Yasser is a really cool dude, like Yossi Sarid, aren't  going to propose giving up Jerusalem.

"Today marks the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of2.5 million Turks and Kurds in Eastern Anatolia and x-SovietArmenia. The following letter, which represents a small portion of the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical documents, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs, was sent to President Bill Clinton, members of Congress, editors, program directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and radio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people. On April 23 of every year, the people of Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the lost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their lives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations may live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and prosperously.------------------------- letter ----------------------------------During the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day, Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland, which is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocidein order to shift international public opinion away from its politicalresponsibility.2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish Genocide.3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism throughthe ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-SovietArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence throughterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supportersof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community frommaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition of the Turkish Genocide.With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorialdemands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish peoplewill unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victimsof the Turkish Genocide demand:1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian Dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish andKurdish people;3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officiallyrecognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuseto succumb to all Armenian political pressure;5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of 2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in theefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new generation has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politicallymature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, throughall necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the armed struggle. Therefore, the victims of the Turkish Genocide call uponall Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in the political, cultural and religious activities of the 78th Anniversaryof the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people.Serdar Argic",9
"I've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I've transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no meansinfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is granted to copy this without restriction.Michael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at aninformal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois.ACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament andInternational Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because thecompany is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped thathis daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tongato visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king,who happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which the king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million,His Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thoughtthere probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronoussatellite slots.  While this isn't entirely off the wall, it was very unusual,seeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot ofslots.The whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and CarlHilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinionssupporting Tonga's case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from 70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside).According to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in theworld because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and the Pacific Rim. RIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a taxhaven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, tofill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would havecost approximately $2 billion.  It's not easy to raise that kind of money.Eventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in Moscow in such harsh terms that I don't think I'll visit there for a long time.Besides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the waythat people operate.  For example ""everybody can sell you everything.""  Everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are theonly ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.Eventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a costof $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternbergsays that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos wasout of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  Heagain described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually,he worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the Russian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessionsbefore signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.The next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied Mechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in Siberia (can't figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has builtabout 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented thatsiberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honestpeople who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At thispoint there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion onboth siberians and midwesterners :-)Sternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is apparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite thatwould sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them specifications, they'll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellitesthat RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  Thiscompares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1million compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their satellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They have the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can giveyou their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they aregetting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into placenow.Tidbits:*  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not bigbusiness because big business is just like what they have over there, exceptthat ""we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.""*  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launchwithin 9 months.*  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirementfund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia,and a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says issort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.*  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worriedpartly because we aren't used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvaryingmonolith.  Italy gets a new government ""every two weeks"" but we don't worry because we're used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing whatreally goes on in Russia we won't worry about their stability as much.*  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transferingmoney.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the ""equivalent"" value in rubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrianbank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so thatthe only the contractors get swindled by the government.*  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western satellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same typeof satellites, which was rather reassuring.*  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitivetechnology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites havea lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites comparewell with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much shorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the difference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition,shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newertechnology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of datehardware.",6

Secondly, surely israeli have human rights, but they ask their goverment toprotect it by withdrawing from the occupied terretories, not by further oppressingPalestinean human rights.Because not all states are like Israel, as oppressive, as ignorant, or as tyrant.   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^So you agree that that an israeli solution wouldnot preserve human rights.(i am understanding this from your first statement in this paragraph).Exactly, you are right. I guess that the problem is that the israeli goverment is full with  men like Joseph Weitz. Above you wrote that you understood what i meant (underlined by ^ ): any system can be used to solve the conflict , but not any system would resolve it JUSTLY.You are proving yourself as a "" "". First you understood what i meant, but thenyou claim you didnot so to claim a contradiction in my logic. Too bad for you, the Master of Wisdom.Why do you feel ashamed by things and facts that you believe in , if you were aZionists. If you believe in Zionist codes and acts, well i feel sorry for you,because the same Rabbi Shoham had said ""Yes, Zionism is racism"".If you feel ashamed and bothered by the Zionist codes, then drop Zionism.If you are not Zionist, why are you bothered then. You should join me incondemning these racist Zionist codes and acts.Hasan",9

To say that feminism equals""superiority"" over men is laughable as long as he doesn't then proceedto pick up a rifle and start to shoot women as a preemptive strike---aka the Canada slaughter that occured a few years ago. But then, menkilling women is nothing new. Islamic Fundamentalists just have a""better"" excuse (Qu'ran).     from the Vancouver Sun, Thursday, October 4, 1990    by John Davidson, Canadian Press     MONTREAL-- Perhaps it's the letter to the five-year old    daughter that shocks the most.     ""I hope one day you will be old enough to understand what    happened to your parents,"" wrote Patrick Prevost. ""I loved    your mother with a passion that went as far as hatred.""     Police found the piece of paper near Prevost's body in his    apartment in northeast Montreal.     They say the 39-year-old mechanic committed suicide after    killing his wife, Jocelyne Parent, 31.     The couple had been separated for a month and the woman had    gone to his apartment to talk about getting some more money    for food. A violent quarrel broke out and Prevost attacked    his wife with a kitchen knife, cutting her throat, police said.     She was only the latest of 13 women slain by a husband or    lover in Quebec in the last five weeks.     Five children have also been slain as a result of the same    domestic ""battles.""     Last year in Quebec alone, 29 [women] were slain by their    husbands. That was more than one-third of such cases across    Canada, according to statistics from the Canadian Centre for    Justice. [rest of article ommited] Then to say that women are somehow ""better"" or ""should"" be theone to ""stay home"" and raise a child is also laughable. Womenhave traditionally done hard labor to support a family, often more than men in many cultures, throughout history. Seems to meit takes at least two adults to raise a child, and that BOTH shouldstay home to do so!",0

"At the time Ezekiel was written, Israel was in apostacy again and if I'm not mistaken, Tyre was about to make war on Israel.  Like I said, the Prince of Tyre was the human ruler of Tyre.

"I'm working on an X11R5 application and have concerns regarding standard colormaps.these colormaps.""  I wonder what window manager the writer had in mind.  Neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps.Of course, one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps.  However, xstdcmap doesn't seem to try very hard to avoid conflicts with the default colormap.  When I use standard colormaps created by xstdcmap, the rest of my display goes black.  So it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid.  Perhaps if every application used standard colormaps, things would be wonderful.  But not many applications seem to use standard colormaps.Finally, the operation of the functions XmuGetColormapAllocation, XmuStandardColormap, and XmuCreateColormap seem inconsistent with the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation.    According to the section 14.3 of the X11R5 XLIB documentation (p. 436):    For GrayScale colormaps, only the colormap, red_max, red_mult, and     base_pixel members are defined.  The other members are ignored.      To compute a GrayScale pixel value, use the following expression:            (gray * red_mult + base_pixel) &0xFFFFFFFF    XmuGetColormapAllocation, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/CmapAlloc.c, is     used by XmuLookupStandardColormap, defined in mit/lib/Xmu/LookupCmap.c    to select red_max, green_max, and blue_max values for the     call to XmuStandardColormap.  When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is     specified, XmuGetColormapAllocation sets red_max to 30% of the     total number of cells in the gray scale, sets green_max to 59%     of the total number, and sets blue_max ot 11% of the total number.    Referring to section 14.3, one would expect XmuGetColormapAllocation     to set red_max to the total number of cells in the gray scale.    When the RGB_GRAY_MAP property is specified, XmuStandardColormap,     defined in mit/lib/Xmu/StdCmap.c, sets red_mult, green_mult,     and blue_mult all equal to 1.  Referring to section 14.3,     one would expect green_mult and blue_mult to be ignored.",15

The neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return forthe hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there's a voltage drop.  If youplug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet, you can commonly measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground.

Nelson Emerson broke in onthe left side, got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot. Belfourcame out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards, where Browncollected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal.Two minutes later on a Hawks power play, Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on ashort-handed break-in.

"Of course; sorry for the misunderstanding.  I was referring to the factthat far more aeronautical development took place in the '30's.  For muchof the '20's, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down theindustry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retiredand Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the pointwhere long-distance flights became practical.  It's important to note thatthe Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in 1927:  Lindbergh,Chamberlin and Levine, and Byrd's _America_.  ""When it's time to railroad,you railroad.""  Not off the top of my head; I'll have to dig out my reference books again.However, I will say that the most common arrangement in Prince Henry theNavigator's Portugal was for the prince to put up part of the money andmerchants to put up the rest.  They profits from the voyage would then beshared.  The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire aMoon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporationscan even consider putting up.  The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft),Orteig's prize, Lord Northcliffe's prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required werewithin the reach of individual inventors, and the prize amounts were wellwithin the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  I think that onlya gov't could afford to set up a $1B+ prize for any purpose whatsoever.  Note that Burt Rutan suggested that NASP could be built most cheaply bytaking out an ad in AvWeek stating that the first company to build a planethat could take off and fly the profile would be handed $3B, no questionsasked.",6

"Many people responded with more anecdotal stories; I think its safe tosay the original poster is already familiar with such stories.Presumably, he wants hard info to substantiate or refute claims aboutMSG making people ill. Similarly, debunking such claims without doing research (whetherliterature and lab), is equally beside the point. The original posterno doubt already knows that some people think 'Chinese RestaurantSyndrome' is bogus.Placebos are all very interesting, but irrelevant to the question ofwhat effects MSG has.

"Of course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented.Just as a penny saved is a penny earned.  Enough with the cliches.My point is that IF the Braves starters are able to live up totheir potential, they won't need much offensive support.I realize this is a BIG IF.  This staff leaves the '92 BoSox in the dust.There is no legitimate comparison.  Two Cy Young winners, and three otherpitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their firstor second starter.  It seems to me that when quality pitchers take themound, the other teams score less runs.  The team that scores the most runs wins.  This puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage(providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs).  A low scoring game would clearly benefit the Braves.  They should have many low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting.On the flip side, if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players,I would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers.They would have an advantage because they could simply outscore theiropponent.  The name of the games is to win.  Even Ray Knight knows thatyou do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard.All I'm trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitcherslike the Braves have, the offense doesn't need to be as strong.",19

"My BBB Autoline arbitration experience is over.  The outcome was decidedly mixed.  I won the battle but lost the war.  The arbitrator found that the car was defective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below market value :(.  At the time of the hearing, average retail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but the decision was for  $17,665.  I wrote a letter to the Council of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the fact that if you have an automobile that does not depreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive to deal with you.  There is no way that the manufacturer can loose because they can turn around and sell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded a repurchase.  The attitude of Chevrolet's representative at the hearing tends to support this point of view;  he was totally unprepared and did not seem to take the proceeding very seriously.I decided to take the repurchase, even though I am getting totally screwed on the price.  I will not have to deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon myself, and I have no case for a civil suit based on the Idaho lemon law.  I am planning to send a letter to my elected representatives telling them how utterly ridiculous the Idaho lemon law is.  The law allows for a ""use deduction"" equal to the IRS mileage allowance.  As if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying for my insurance.Summary of the case:  In May 1992 I bought a new 3/4 tonHD Chevrolet pickup.  Between May 1992 and December 1992 this vehicle required repair after repair.  Systems that required attention included the transmission, heater fan, paint, suspension, and motor.  The main problem was the five speed manual transmission.  They could not install a non-defective transmission in at least four attempts.So, in summary, it is possible to get a repurchase, but you are going to get screwed on the price, unless you paid too much in the first place, or if your car happens to be a model that depreciates rapidly.",17

"I agree entirely.  Speaking as an atheist (heterosexual, for what it'sworth), this is one of the least attractive parts of some varieties ofChristianity.  Although I'm sure it's possible to argue theologicallythat we shouldn't make analogies between discrimination on the basisof sex and race and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation,morally the case looks unanswerable (for those outside religion): thethree forms _are_ analogous; we shouldn't discriminate on the basis ofsex, race or sexual orientation.I found the moderator's FAQs on the subject instructive, and recommendeveryone to read them.There seem to be three different levels of acceptance:1) Regard homosexual orientation as a sin (or evil, whatever)2) Regard homosexual behaviour as a sin, but accept orientation(though presumably orientation is unfortunate) and dislike people whoindulge3) As 2, but ""love the sinner""4) Accept homosexuality altogether.My experience is that 3 is the most common attitude (I imagine 1 and 2are limited to a few fundamentalist sects).I suppose I can go along with 3, except that I have this feeling thata 14--15 year old living in a community with this attitude, ondiscovering that they were more attracted to members of the same sex,would not feel the love of the community, but would rather feel thepressure not to exhibit their feelings.

"Hi,   I've just built a valve preamp and use a diode/capacitorvoltage multiplier to step the 12vAC supply voltage up to approx 260vDV. As the load resistance increases, the RC constant decreasesand hence the output voltage drops. I need as high an outputvoltage as possible. (about 260v).  The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages(ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38vacross them, and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v.  Each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v. If I increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that willincrease the RC constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem.These capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need 14 ofthem, So:1. What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel with the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)?  Will it, as I assume, increase the C in circuit and hence increasethe RC time constant? If it does, and my output voltage becomes morestable by doing this, then I will have killed two birds with one stone...as I am experiencing some 50Hz ripple (and hence amp hum), and this newcapacitor will 'smooth' this out.and2.

"Besides being an infringement on our civil liberties (not the subjectin this post), the name ""Clipper Chip"" seems very confusable with the""Clipper"" chip of Intergraph.Originally designed by a team at Fairchild Semiconductor, Clipper wasa 32-bit RISC microprocessor. It is still used in some workstations,notably those from Intergraph, the supplier of CAD tools.

"Alan, you can start by teaching your children that the perpetratorsof crimes no more represent the ""Black community"" than racist hateful Whitesrepresent the majority culture (although there are many ethnic minoritieswho have fallen into the very trap that you are struggling with, and believeotherwise). The trap is the easy way out.	For yourself, I think it would be a good idea to realize that thedemographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race,and much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement. You'regoing to find higher crime within *any* community comprised of *any* ethnicgroup or subgroup that has become dysfunctional, whatever the factorsleading to that dysfunction. With ethnic minorities it is more usually thannot, as I said, socioeconomic disenfranchisement.	If, for example, you lived in an area where there were very fewBlacks, but quite a few poor-for-generations Whites, you'd see the crimestatistics reflecting the dysfunction of those White people. Would you thenworry about whther your children would begin to see Whites as undesireableor whatever? The trap springs into action when our innate compunction todefine ""us"" and ""other"" raises its little voice. The trap becomes dangerouswhen we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rationalhumans.	It's interesting that Blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the*most* criminal element in many of our urban areas. I don't know the racialmakeup of Phoenix, so I can't speak to your situation. However, I live inSan Francisco, a city that loves to tout its ""ethnic diversity"". Here, wehave Black gangs, Hispanic gangs, Asian (yes, the ""model minority"") gangs,and even a few White gangs. The Asian gangs have become a particularlytroublesome element for law enforcement here, mainly due (I think) to theirpropensity for engaging in organized criminal activities. But ask people onthe street and they'll, 8-out-of-10 times, tell you that Black gangs andcrime are what they most fear. During the ""disturbance"" in Los Angeles lastyear many of the rioters and looters were not Black. Some were even White! Iremember being amazed at  television news scenes that showed looting mobswhere there were maybe one or two Blacks at most! My perceptions, gleanedfrom TV news, were further corroborated by numerous friends and relativesthat live in Los Angeles. This may have been the country's first trulymulti-ethnic riot. Yet I know from face-to-face and online discussion thatin the minds of America the popular perception is that it was a *Black*riot!	In closing, I'd like to say that you raise some interesting pointsthat really need discussion. Our country has spent too long ignoring theracism (and its attendant ills) that is very much a part of our culture. Asa people, we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths, and the problembecomes compounded *daily*. We cannot afford to do it much longer. I trulybelieve that the  well-being of ALL OF US depends on changing our currentcourse of denial and repression.	I wish you and your children, and all other people, of *all* colors,luck in avoiding the ""trap"". 	Peace, my brother.			m.--",10

Remember, those are relocated Azeris into         the Armenian LAND of KARABAKH by the STALIN regime.henrik] At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the henrik] KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER henrik] OCCUR again.BM] You're not playing with a full deck, are you?

That's hard to do when Armenians BM] are attacking Azeri towns.	So, let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying; Turkey        wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT. NOT !!	I will believe it when I see it.	Now, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a GUN pointing        to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef(fat chance)?	Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the	BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN.

Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic. They are         NOT asking much. They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY 	from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN. BM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent BM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe BM] the other out.   These people will be neighbors, would it not be better BM] to keep the bad blood between them minimal?	Don't get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to the	conflict. But until Azeris realize that, the Armenians in	KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion.BM] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikesBM] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of BM] their blood and future. 	Again, you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intension        to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan.

I wrote that human brains ""areinfested with sin"", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.Which just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if yourconscience is properly formed?The only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging theformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be surethat your conscience is `properly formed' if you assume that your evaluationcan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I'llgrant, but it's not a valid way of reasoning.Unless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot becertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is`properly formed'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)Mr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:The Church is `by necessity' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?How do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument oranother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?You write:But there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability todistinguish what is true from what is not true' and `infallible'.  I amconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long wayfrom `confident'.This discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain issignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say thatyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.Except in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutelycertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have anyidea of his own fallibility.I have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source oftruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All ofthem -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.The result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to theoriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original posterregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wronganswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternalconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he isat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this arefallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But thesebasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it'sunlikely that I'm misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level ofconfidence, I've tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully asto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven't, forexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,and I haven't attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have afeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant andintolerant even though I acknowledge that I'm fallible and so there'ssome chance I'm wrong.Don't get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogantChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at leastsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.If the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences forcertain decisions, it's not my fault -- I'm just telling it the way Ithink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up thatway.  It's one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it mostdifficult to respond to.  But it's not arrogance for me to tell whatI think is the truth.",7

"Sixteen days I had put off test driving the Honda ST1100.  Finally,the 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up, became warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, Itook a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride.They had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hoursbefore I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom --surrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.Today was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes,50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly FatTouring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot.Some sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running oneMSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one onthe back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food thatCycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed likea big moto party.After about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime,and another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/pray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in theparking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from the Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything elseinto the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the ST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge ofthe road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like abicycle!  'It cant be that heavy' I thought.Well I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could think was ""big"".  Then I put one foot up.  ""Heavy"" came to mind veryquickly.

Hard to tell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemednearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.By 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Evenon bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that did not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! ison a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles northof the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95splits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited accesshighway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton, Manchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester.On its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through manythoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.Cindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring alongin top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane changes were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this thing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind thefairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting wasnon-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless.Smooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of,but it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endlessbuzz.The jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with thebrakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius,decreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.  The section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works okin this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shackoft featured in ""Spencer for Hire"" -- a place where you could really find ""Spencer"", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After puttingthrough traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.About half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy's wrist, our singalfor ""hold on tight"".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Secondgear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a short shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very lighttraffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new.Well, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effortlane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayedthere.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering, I looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.Beverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the ""getoff in a mile"" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wantedto re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there wereseveral manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the slow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could see even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managedto thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete padout front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to putthe thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the sidestand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.My demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable,hardly notices the DoD speed.   I'd buy on for about $3000 less than list, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is.",18

"While I don't read normally read this group, I was looking for Valentine radarinformation (sigh, maybe in the FAQ) and came across your posting..I bought a '93 Probe GT with the PEP 263A last July (now at 9500 miles)after debating over the Sentra SE-R/NX2000, MX6, MR-2, Stealth, Prelude, and Celica.Check this month's Consumer Reports for previous Probe records.  My criteria: a ""fun"" car with ABS, airbag, over 130hp, and less than $25K.I thought about a turbo, but checking with insurance people ruled that out.The Tri-Star cars (Eclipse/Talon/etc) were out since they don't have an air bag.Ditto for the Mustang(also no ABS).The SE-R/NX2000/M20 fell into the pocket-rocket category.  A good used car buy.The MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked.  I didn't like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all.  Too weird for me.The MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went.The Celica was ""ok"" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhatoverpriced too) in non-turbo form.I never considered the 240SX since it didn't have an airbag.  I did look at itfor its RWD virtues but that's it.  The Corolla never entered my mind.I should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more.Since my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)The car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see itsreliability so far.  For what it's worth, my comments:My dislikes:Shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal.Headlights have ""stuck"" up a few times (weather?)air conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch)condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely.crammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical)parts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford partsunderside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical).assembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not stitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke.Ford only gives 1 key with the car.  C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies!Rear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I'm waiting for the day whenI bash my head on the corner.horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference)Tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car My Likes:engine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1handling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits)transmission (the 5 speed is a must)usable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere)Very little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 SHO I drive)stability at 100+mph (high gearing though)low cowl (good visibility in front)Heated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather)ABS/Air bag (see above)rear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important)No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)Tires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)As you can see, I'm primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn'thave the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big sellingpoint for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.  The overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn't changedmuch since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from workeach day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that theProbe's suspension doesn't like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable.If you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll findthat they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car ridesdifferently (if that's ""better"" is up to you).  Also, there's a lot of glassaround you which I wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets prettyhot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain aboutthe lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined withthe heat.  I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine.Leather and the keyless entry system weren't available when I got the car soI can't comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).  I prefer cloth to leather anyway.  I wouldn't want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for theinevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assumethat you're not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wipercontrols are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with theEagles (and I was really trying).  There is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GThas map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plasticthat could fit two cassettes or CD's max.  The center console/storage bin/armrest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth ""pouch""but that's it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO.And the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!Lastly, don't store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the water up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.Nathannathan@sco.com",17

"Well, it looks like the folks in soc.religion.islam have loosened upa bit and are discussing this topic as well as the banking/interesttopic.  A few books on the subject have also been mentioned in additionto the one you mentioned.  These may be hard to find, but I think I maytake a stab at it out of curiosity.  I know the one film I saw on thissubject was pretty weak and the only two quotes I have seen which wereused to show science in the Koran (which I posted here) were also pretty vague.  I suspect that these books will extrapolate an awful lot on thequotes they have.At least one poster on the Islam channel seems to have some misgivingsabout the practice of using the Koran to decide what is good science.I wonder if Islam has ever come up with the equivalent of the Christians""Creation Science"" on any topic.  It would be interesting to find a historyof scientific interpretations of the Koran, to see if anyone used the Koranto support earlier science which has since been discarded.  It is all tooeasy to look at science as it exists today and then ""interpret"" passagesto match those findings.  People do similar things with the sayings ofNostradamus all the time.",0

"Troglodytism does not necessarily imply a low cultural level.The image-conscious Armenians sorely feel a missing glory in their background. Armenians have never achieved statehood and independence, they have always been subservient, and engaged in undermining schemes against their rulers. They committed genocide against the Muslim populations of Eastern Anatolia and Armenian Dictatorship before and during World War I and fully participated in the extermination of the European Jewry during World War II. Belligerence, genocide, back-stabbing, rebelliousness and disloyalty have been the hallmarks of the Armenian history.

"As has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_and _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it isdescribed in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replicationsdo indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should beaccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, andreasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.But people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazyreasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are alarge part of the history of science.There are a couple of negative points to make here:1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without directverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an acceptedpart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  Whatwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medicalreality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim couldlie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body ofexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.(I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.I don't think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much lessa theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And itis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of ratherdirectly verifying the existence of qi.)2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rationalexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, andinterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoreticalcontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,there is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,petty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and whichcomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the criticalfunction of science: results don't count unless they can be replicated.The whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generatepart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.Pasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;but even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;that when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotatepolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version wasindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur's irrational motivation hadled to a replicable, and important, result.This is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually noteven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When theirtheories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do notconcede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppressthe results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence theythink supports their position (creationists).",5

"Has anyone had any problems with their Duo Dock not ejecting the Duoproperly?When I first got it, the Duo would come out of the Dock a couple of incheswhen ejected, and I had to pull it the rest of the way. Nowadays (and I'vehad the system for 4 months), the Duo doesn't come out *at* *all* - despitethe fact that the mechanism makes all the appropriate noises, and I have tograb hold of it and pull it out myself. Is there a simple fix for this, ordo I have to return it to my Apple Dealer, where it will languish for weekswhile I have to make do with no colour display, no VRAM, no floppy orSCSI etc. (BTW, it's not that the Duo is locked into the Dock - it just doesn'twant to slide out any more).",14

">Loud pipes are a biligerent exercise in ego projection,No arguements following, just the facts.I was able to avoid an accident by revving my engine and having my*stock* Harley pipes make enough noise to draw someones attention.I instinctively revved my engine before I went for my horn. Don't knowwhy, but I did it and it worked. Thats rather important.I am not saying ""the louder the pipes the better"". My Harley is loudand it gets me noticed on the road for that reason. I personally donot feel it is to loud. If you do, well thats to bad; welcome to America - ""Home of the Free, Land of the Atlanta Braves"".If you really want a fine tuned machine like our federal governmentto get involved and pass Db restrictions; it should be generousenough so that a move like revving your engine will get you noticed.Sure there are horns but my hand is already on the throttle.

"I seldom see any posts in this group. Is anyone out there in Christendomlistening? If so, why don't we get some dialog going here?Here's a topic to get things started. My daughter's Christian school sendshome a weekly update on school related topics. This week they sentsomething *very* interesting. It was an article written by the leader of anational (US) Christian school organization about a trip he recently madeto Jerusalem. While there, he was introduced to one of the rabbis who isworking on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem. The articleincluded photos of the many furnishings that have already been made inpreparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to thespecifications given in the Bible. What was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple arecomplete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeligovernment before beginning the building. The other startling fact is thevery recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple isunoccupied and available for building. Previously it has been thought thatthe original site was underneath what is now a mosque, making rebuildingimpossible without sparking a holy war. Now it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resumingsacrifices, as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days.Although the Israeli government will give the permission to start, I thinkit is the hand of God holding the project until He is ready to let ithappen. Brothers and sisters, the time is at hand. Our redemption isdrawing near. Look up!",7

"That would be neat, but nowhere in the Bible does it saythat one who has the gift of tounges can do this.  If the giftof tounges were the ability to be understood by everyone,no matter what languages they know, there would be no need for thegift of interpretation, and I Corinthians 14 would not have had tohave been written. That's a pretty harsh assumption to make about a several millionChristians world wide.  Sure, there are some who want gloryfor themselves who speak in tounges, just as there are among thosewho do not have this gift.  There were people like this in the Corinthianchurch also.  that does not mean that there is no true gift or that allwho speak in tounges do it for their own glory in the sight of men.  I would venture to say that a large percentage of those who do speak in tounges do so more often in private prayer than in public.Link Hudson",7

"Hello Everyone,    I have a Casio TV-470 LCD Color Television for sale.  Itis in mint condition.  Retail is $199 but I'm looking toget about 1/2 of that for it, tops.  Highest bidder in a week gets it, assuming the highest bidder is at least $60.TV comes with black case and uses 4 AA batteries.  They alsosell AC adaptor.  It has external jack for phones and externalantenna, etc.  The picture is very good and it has electronictuning so you don't have to screw with tuning a picture in, etc.I have the box and all documentation.

"Contents:Problems with table widgets in R5	The following part of a program (an user interface for a simulation	system) did work in R4, but refused to in R5. Of cause, the R4-version	did not know about the xpTableWidgetClass (we used tableWidgetClass 			instead - caught from the net in times of R3) and XpTableChildPosition 			(formerly XtTblPosition).	Since compiling with R5, the program causes a zero width or height error	(on sparc-stations). The trouble-shooter is the (re)computation of the	model_init_table - table widget: though its childs (label and asciiText 	widgets) exist, XtQueryGeometry returns a prefered width and height of 			zero. 	Thus the following asignment cannot perform anything else but set the 			width and height of the newly created widget to zero. No wonder XtPopup 		or XtManage- Child create zero width or height errors (dependent on 			whether width and height of the shell widget are set in the resource 			file or not).		Question: Does anyone know, why XtQueryGeometry returns so low prefered			values when working on table widgets or perhaps what			to do about?	I'll be happy, if someone is able to help me.

"My 14-y-o son has the usual teenage spotty chin and greasy nose.  Ibought him Clearasil face wash and ointment.  I think that is probablyenough, along with the usual good diet.  However, he is on at me toget some product called Dalacin T, which used to be adoctor's-prescription only treatment but is not available over thechemist's counter.  I have asked a couple of pharmacists who sayeither his acne is not severe enough for Dalacin T, or that Clearasilis OK.  I had the odd spots as a teenager, nothing serious.  Hisfather was the same, so I don't figure his acne is going to escalateinto something disfiguring.  But I know kids are senstitive abouttheir appearance.

"Let's say you have a scanned image of a line drawing; in this case aboat, but it could be anything.  On the drawing you have a set ofreference points whose true x,y positions are known.  Now you digitize the drawing manually (in this case, using YaronDanon's excellent Digitize program).  That is, you use a program whichconverts cursor positions to x,y and saves those values when you clickthe mouse.Upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that comeout of the digitizing process differ in small but significant waysfrom the known true values.  This is understandable because thescanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there aresuccessive sources of distortion such as differential expansion andcontraction of paper, errors introduced in the printing process,scanner errors and what have you.The errors are not uniform over the entire drawing, so ""global""adjustments such as stretching/contracting uniformly over x or y, orrotating the whole drawing, are not satisfactory.So the question is: does any kind soul know of an algorithm forremoving such distortion?  In particular, if I have three sets ofpoints Reference(x,y) (the known true values)DistortedReference(x,y) (the same points, with known errors)DistortedData(x,y) (other points, with unknown errors)what function of Reference and Distorted could I apply toDistortedData to remove the errors.I suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distortedreference points as resulting from the projection of a ""bumpy"" 3dsurface, solving for the surface and then ""flattening"" it to removethe errors in the other data points.Any kind and informed soul out there have any ideas, or better yet,pointers to treatments of the same or similar problems?Thanks,",1

So, what I don't understand is how a statute like 922 can be enforced on an individual. So someone tell me how my government can tellme what I can or cannot possess. Just passing a law does not make it LAW. Everyone knows that laws are constitionaluntil it goes to court. So, has it ever gone to court, notjust your run of the mill ""Ok I had it I am guilty, put me in jail""Has anyone ever claimed that they had a right to possess and was toldby the Supreme Court that they didn't have that right?",8

"Yes I fully agree with that, but is it ""I don't believe gods exist"", or""I believe no gods exist""? As MANDTBACKA@FINABO.ABO.FI (Mats Andtbacka)pointed out, it all hinges on what you take the word ""believe"" to mean.Unfortunately this is bound up in the definitions of strong and weakatheism, at least according to the FAQ:# Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.# Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is# often referred to as the ""weak atheist"" position, and the latter as ""strong# atheism"".# # It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  ""Weak# atheism"" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  ""Strong# atheism"" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not# fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are ""strong atheists"".(From mathew's ""An Introduction to Atheism"" version 1.2 last modified 5-Apr-93)Should the FAQ be clarified to try to pin down this notion of ""belief""?Can it?",0

"For an upcoming project I want to use 4 Megs of DRAM configured as two 2Meg banks of 16 bit data.  I was wondering if anyone out there knows of aDRAM controller which will handle refreshing the data.  It's ok if thecontroller doesn't handle bank switching - that part is easy.The only controllers I know of are the ones out of the NationalSemiconductor DRAM Management Handbook (1988 edition) eg. DP8429.  I wouldlike to know if another manufacturer produces one which may be easier toimplement in my circuit.BTW, if anyone is wanting to hook up DRAM to a microcontroller, DallasSemiconductor makes a neat chip: the DS1262 Serial DRAM NonvolatizerChip.  It uses the SPI (I2C) bus and refreshes/controls up to 16Mx1 of DRAMmemory.  It can use an external battery to refresh the DRAM when thepower is off.  Price is $11.75 from Dallas (quan 1).  I wish I could usethis chip but its maximum SPI clock rate is 1 MHz (too slow for me...).Thanks in advance,Wayne Schellekens<schellew@wu2.wl.aecl.ca>",4

"FYI:  The actual horizontal dot placement resoution of an HPdeskjet is 1/600th inch.  The electronics and dynamics of the inkcartridge, however, limit you to generating dots at 300 per inch.On almost any paper, the ink wicks more than 1/300th inch anyway.The method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printerresults in much less spread than ink drop technology.It doesn't take much investigation to see that the mechanical andelectronic complement of a laser printer is more complex thaninexpensive ink jet printers.  Recall also that laser printersoffer a much higher throughput:  10 ppm for a laser versus about 1ppm for an ink jet printer.Something else to think about is the cost of consumables over thelife of the printer.  A 3000 page yield toner cartridge is about$US 75-80 at discount while HP high capacity (~500-1000 page yield)cartridges are about $US 22 at discount.  It could be that over thelife cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers areless than ink jet printers.  It is getting progressively closerbetween the two technologies.  Laser printers are usually desingedfor higher duty cycles in pages per month and longer productreplacement cycles.",4
"And now, I interrupt your regularly scheduled news reading to bring you another message sponsored by the Department of Really Mundane Statistics:I passed the final individual player stats posted here the other day througha filter to average out games, goals, assists, points, and penalty minutesfor the mythical average NHL pro who played in the league this season. (Why?Because it's Monday and I didn't feel like writing any REAL code...)Anyway, after I wiped out the 60-odd goalies in the list, I came up with:NHL average:		55 GP      11 G      19 A      30 Pts      69 PIMThen I passed the list through a second time to come up with the players whohad the smallest percentage difference in each of the categories.Marty McInnis (NYI)	56 GP (1%) 10 G (9%) 20 A (5%) 30 Pts (0%) 24 PIM (65%)Igor Kravchuk (EDM)	55 GP (0%) 10 G (9%) 17 A (10%) 27 Pts (9%) 27 PIM (53%)These two are close in games, goals, assists, and points, but are too far offin PIM. This leaves, as the most average player in the NHL:Bobby Carpenter (WAS)	65 GP (18%) 11 G (0%) 17 A (10%) 28 Pts (6%) 63 PIM (8%)What an honor.I also passed the list through with the goalies still included. Kravchuk andCarpenter were still in the top three, but Rob DiMaio came flying up from behind to take the title:NHL average:		53 GP      10 G      17 A      27 Pts      64 PIMIgor Kravchuk (EDM)     55 GP (3%) 10 G (0%) 17 A (0%) 27 Pts (0%) 27 PIM (50%)Bobby Carpenter (WAS)   65 GP (22%) 11 G (10%) 17 A (0%) 28 Pts (3%) 63 PIM (1%)Rob DiMaio (TB)		54 GP (1%) 9 G (9%) 15 A (11%) 24 Pts (11%) 62 PIM (3%)It's all really kind of underwhelming when you think about it.-SG",2
"think again!!  thanks to 60 minutes (tick tick tick), used 200quattros are bargains.. '89s go for about $15K, '90s go for perhaps 1or 2K more, the 20 valve 91's are quite a bit more because of anenormous hp and torque gain.. i think they go for about $23 to $25K ifyou can find one.  i have seen quite a lot of '89-'90 200 quattros (notthat many wagons though) at the dealer lot.. they use very highquality paint and the entire car is zinc galvanized, so it will neverrust.in short, typically a 4 yr old 200 looks no more older than a 1 yearold and the 5 bangers are bullet proof engines.  200K out of one isnot rare, even for a turbo, which is watercooled for the 200s.  thenthere are aftermarket chips that you can buy to bump up turbo boost...if you are into luxo-gizmos.. the cars are loaded with just abouteverything too..the price of parts is a different story though...",17
"I need (probably) to write one or more new Motif widgets on the HP-UX   platform. Do I need the Motif private header files and source,   or can I make do with the public headers that are provided?   ""Motif"" includes Xt in this context.Yes.  You'll find it almost impossible without the sourceat this point.  It does depend on how ambitious you are andhow concerned you are about compliance with the generalinterface and items like traversal.   One widget is a multi-column list (which lots of people have   already written, I am sure), and would therefore be probably be   a subclass of List rather than something simple like an Xt class.   Is this more difficult (in principle, not lines of code)?I'm not sure what you're asking.  You could create somethingwhich is very much like a true multi-column list by placingseveral lists within a geometry manager,  and putting thatmanager within an automatic scrolled window.  This wouldn'tbe good for very large lists,  but you might consider thisas an alternative.   Alternatively, if anyone has a multi-column list widget they   could sell me, this might save me from having to write one!   Does it by any chance exist in Motif 1.2 already (I do not   yet have the spec)?Motif 1.2 does not have a multi-column list in it.  Have youlooked at commercial sets?  There are also some PD widget sets,  one of these might have a multi-column listyou could port.",15

"Hi.  I am working on a project for my marketing class and I'd like toask your help.  The assignment is to come up with a product and create amarketing plan for it.  Technical issues are not terribly important atthis point.  Well, my group's plan is to market a ""full page"" monitorfor laptop computers.  It would be a third-party product to be installedby authorized repair centers (like Newer Technology's PaletteBookscreen).  The idea is that the screen would fold in such a way that youwould get twice the screen height of a normal screen (remember,technical issues aside!).  In fact, by adjusting the fold of the screenand the monitor configuration, you could have regular OR ""full"" height. The screen would probably be monochrome.The motivation behind this is that laptop computers seem to be verypopular among business people.  Business people also commonly use wordprocessing and spreadsheet applications for which it is very convenientto see a large portion of the document.  Because of the target users andapplications, color screens aren't really a neccessity.  We couldhopefully keep the cost between $2000 and $3000.Now, please don't write this off as completely ridiculous.  I reallyneed some constructive feedback.  So, if you would, please reply to mevia email and let me know:1. If you would consider buying a ""full page"" laptop screen2. How much you would be willing to pay for it3. Any helpful commentaries on the ideaAlso, if you take this idea and make a lot of money off it (doubtful,but who knows!), please send me some.Thanks in advance!!!",14

When the tube fires, insufficient current runs through the starter to keep the heat up and the bi-metalic strip straightens out (O/C).BTW, I too thought that they were nothing more than a small neon, so one day when the neon in my sisters digital (flip the metal squares type) clock broke (flimsy leads), I replaced it with one from a starter.

"Most of the points you made about Lopez v. Berryhill/Olson have beenmade by others, and realizing that Lopez must be the second coming ofFrank Thomas, I have relented and praised the unmistakeable wisdom ofhis supporters.See?  This is essentially what everyone was doing  -  comparing Lopezto one of the best players in the game.  I'm really looking forwardto seeing this can't-miss superstar now.  As for Thomas, I rememberbeing an advocate of his being brought up in 1990 even though he wasonly 21 or 22 (can't remember).  But who did the Sox have at first?Calderon?  Martinez?  Kittle?  The spot was there.  The talent wasthere.  Sure, I say go for it.I am not convinced that Lopez is anywhere near as talented as Thomaswas after his AA season in 1989, and I am not convinced that Olson/Berryhill are nearly as bad as Kittle/Martinez were.BTW, I don't think Thomas was hurt by those three months.Well, if we can't compare our guy to one of the best in the game,let's compare our decision to one of the most ""Boneshead"", right?Cal Eldred was 24 when he came up, with a full season at AAA and alonger minor league career.  Frankly, I don't know why he didn'tmake the club in 1992.  Bones is a year younger with a lousy priorhistory, and just watching him makes me think that I missed a career as a big-league pitcher.

": You should be ashamed to call yourself an Ulf Samuelson fan. Anybody who plays: the way he does, does not belong in the NHL.

Violence in hockey has got to be curbed: and players like (Should have been a Women) Samuelson don't belong. When players: like Ulf, who's main purpose is to injure the better players in the league is allowed: to continue, and the league won't stop it, the players should. A Christian Pro 1000: aluminum stick directed at his ugly head should do the trick nicely. If the Bruins get: a chance to meet Pittsburgh in the near future, you can bet Neely will have his day.: The sight of watching Ulf turtle up like the coward he is, is worth almost as much as a: Stanely Cup. This wimp of a player almost ruined the career of one the best right wingers: in the game. If you are to remove Ulf Samuelson from the lineup, the Penguins would not: even notice he's gone.

"From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>Subject: Gaza and separation from IsraelGaza and the idea of separationThe Israeli Left's inability to cope with the challenges it ispresented with by reality becomes obvious at those moments whenthe reality does not line up with the expectations of the left. Wewere able to see this clearly during the Gulf War.  Because of thePalestinian's popular solidarity with Iraq, Yossi Sarid -currently Minister of the Environment - made his infamousstatement: ""You look for me !"", i.e., I'am not making any moreefforts to speak with you. From Yossi Sarid's point of view,Palestinian reality during the Gulf War was not the lengthy curfewor the danger of hunger it brought with it, but whether or not thePalestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party. SimilarlyMERETZ, MK Deddi Tzuker, recently faced with criticism fromresidents of the West Bank town of Beit Sahour over hisgovernment's and his party's lack of action for human rights andpeace, responded by asking those present at the discussion whetherthey would rather have a Likud government. From the Leftists'perspective this is the best government because it is THEIRgovernment, regardless of what it does.These members of the Israeli Left have already decided how thefuture of the Occupied Territories will look, and they want todictate to the Palestinians how to get there. An essential steptowards this future is their participation in Yitzhak Rabin'sgovernment, and from their point of view the expulsions were amarginal byproduct of this ""government of peace"", which need notdisturb the routine course of events. Likewise the ""Rabinic""policies in Gaza - the blowing up of houses with anti-tank rocketsand the significant increases in the number of persons injured inthe suppression of demonstrations - need not disturb it.But the fact that reality is not as they would have it forcesitself upon them when a mob in Gaza falls upon a settler who haslost his way, when a settler is stabbed by his Palestinianworkers, or when a Palestinian knifes people in the streets of TelAviv. Then all hell breaks loose and the Israeli Left has nothingto propose except separation: Let's cut ourselves off from thePalestinians, let's build a fence so high that they won't be ableto harm us - this is the cry of the Israeli Left. Let us erect afence between us and the reality whith is the occupation.Meron Benvenisti writes about this in Ha'aretz (4-3-93): ""...Theliberal Left. which does not differentiate between physicalseparation and 'the future of the territories', must come tounderstand that the regime of magnetic cards, exclusion of Arabworkers, closure, and curfew are instruments of enforcementdesigned for the suppression of a population in revolt, and thattheir ideological support for separation only provides'humanitarian' arguments for the legitimization of the <statusquo>.Enforced separation is carried out only to meet the need of theruling community, but it is only the ruled population which bearsits burden. [.....].""Whoover thinks that 'out of Gaza first' is a liberal,humanitarian idea had best contemplate the question of whetherthis position is also moral. It is very easy to shake offresponsibility for this concentration of human suffering, and tothus also disregard responsibility for it's creation. It is veryeasy to erect a fence between Jewish and Arab neighborhoods inJerusalem, when this fence has a gate - the keys to which are atthe disposal of one hand - which opens to allow the Jews to pursueall their interests, but is barred to the Arabs..."".",9

"I had exactly the same problem with a 1981 Horizon.  Third gear wouldjust disengage.  Engine would rev up.

The atrocities committed by the Armenian  volunteer forces accompanying the Russian army were so severe that the  Russian commanders themselves were compelled to withdraw them from the  fighting fronts and sent them to rear guard duties.

To one brought up, as most Americans have  been, in the Gladstonian and foreign-missionary tradition, the condition of  the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every  nation in the world would have treated as treasonable.

Their hope was their participation in the Russian success would be rewarded with an independent Armenian state carved out of Ottoman territories.

I'am arguing about : the Armenian-Nazi colaboration during World War II. Any comment?It could be, perhaps, your head wasn't screwed on just right. In 1941, while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration camps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of theformer guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of theshort-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920.An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of extermination of the Jews.This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an ""encore""performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed andexterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.Furthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granteda respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the MudrosArmistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decidedto create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian provinceof Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatoliaclaimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia(around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as ithad already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly setabout attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, whocould be expected to oppose their plans. On April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilianand military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The Britishplanned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even though the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the British could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate ofthe Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlierin Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destructionof Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks ofKars to the mountains or south and west to the safety affordedby remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left the scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few Europeans were present to observe the genocide. One Britishsoldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise thedisarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring. Rawlinson wired to his superiors, ""in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops  being without discipline and not being under effective control, atrocities were constantly being committed.""

In short, both cities are burnt, destroyed and trees cut down.

I will note you did quote the end of this particular paragraph which states:    	Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with	respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed	and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it	will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of	a year.But, do you knew how much organization is required to training a largegroup of poeple twice a year.  Just to try to get the same peopleevery year, provide a basic training to new people so they canbe integrated into the force, and find a suitable location, it requires a continually standing committee of organizers.  Since a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure anddisipline, and meet once or twice a year to train, how can you claima ""well regulated militia"" is not well organized.  But I will concide a ""well organized militia"" is not necessarily a ""well regulated militia."" Several people have stated that the ""well organized militia"" iswhat is defined under 10 USC 311, which states	The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied 	males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in 	section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, 	or who have made a declaration of intention to become, 	citizens of the United States and of female citizents of 	the United States who are commissioned officers of the 	National Guard.This deos define the militia, but were is the adjective ""well regulated.""10 USC 311 does not define a ""well regualed militia"" in any way, shape, or form.  It only defines who can become part of a well regulated militiaThe Federalist Papers CLEARLY define the ""well regualed militia"" as aproper SUBSET of the militia.  In the same paragraph quoted above, ittalk above ""disciplining all the militia of the United States"" so theyfit the ""character of a well-regulated militia.""  This is what theparagraph states about the associated costs:	It would form an annual deduction from the productive labor 	of the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the 	present numbers of the people, would not fall far short 	of the whole expense of the civil  establishments of all 	the States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the 	mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent,	would be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not 	succeed, because it would not long be endured.Another quote provide by Charles Scripter is:James Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the ""General Welfare"" clause): 	""Nothing is more natural nor common than first	to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a	recital of particulars.""So the phrase ""the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed"" must either qualify or explain the phrase ""a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state.""  The definition of ""explain"" as stated in ""The American HertitageDictionary of the Enlish Language"" The New College Edition, 1982 is:	1) To make plain or comprehensible; remove obscruity from;	   elucidate: ""It was the economists who undertook to explain 	   this puzzle""	2) To define; explicate; expound: He explained his plan.	3) To offer reasons for or a cause of; an answer for' justify:	   explain an errorThe second phrase clearly does not ""explain"" the first, thereforethe second phrase must ""qualify"" the first.  The definition givenfor ""qualify"" is:	1) To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities	   of; characterize.	2) To make competent or suitable for office, position, or 	   task.	3) To give legal power to; make legally capable.	4) To modify, limit, or restrict, as giving exceptions.	5) To make less harsh or severe; moderate	6) Grammar: To modify the meaning of (a word or phrase)Since ""the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not beinfringed"" does not describe, modify or make less harsh anything andit has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task.By process of elimination it must fall into definition #3.  And since#3 deals with legal power, the same thing the Constitution does, itmust be the correct definition in this case.  Therefore, ""the right of the people to keep and bear Arms"" gives legal power to the ""well regualated militia"" and this legal power ""shall not be infringed"".  I thank you very much Mr Scripter, you have provided me with more evidence that the Second Amendment only concerns itseft with the people's right to form well regulate militia, and says very little about the right of an untrained person to ""keep and bear"" a .50 calibermachine gun.  And since I, totally untrained in the use of any firearm(something I personly have meant to correct by going to a NRA gunsafety course and joining a gun club), cannot legally buy such a machinegun, I conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree withme.-> So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy-> our Liberties and Rights.I mean ""to destory our Liberties and Rights.""  Is that why a participatein the discussion of exactly what ""our Libertues and Rights"" are?  I force my version of ""our Liberties and Rights"" by begining statementsof what ""our Liberties and Rights"" with ""All that the Second Amendment clearly states to me.""   Using expressions, such as ""states to me,"" clearly mean I intend to force my views on others?  I don't think so.So in effort not to force my views and not ""to destory our Liberties andRights,""  I state that nothing I have written, or will write, inthe matter of ""Liberties and Rights"" is the final word.  For I am onlyone person among many and the final word on ""Liberties and Rights"" clearyand irrevocably belongs to the many.",8

The parts aremostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.We don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.Notes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.The sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu as /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography FAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answersevery 21 days.Contents:* In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem?* What is an attack?* What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically?* Why is the one-time pad secure?* What's a ciphertext-only attack?* What's a known-plaintext attack?* What's a chosen-plaintext attack?* In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks?* What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?* In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem?  A private-key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system E and a  decryption system D. The encryption system E is a collection of  functions E_K, indexed by ``keys'' K, mapping some set of  ``plaintexts'' P to some set of ``ciphertexts'' C. Similarly the  decryption system D is a collection of functions D_K such that  D_K(E_K(P)) = P for every plaintext P.  That is, succesful decryption  of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key  (index) as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext  into ciphertext.  Such systems, wherein the same key value is used to  encrypt and decrypt, are also known as ``symmetric'' cryptoystems.* What is an attack?  In intuitive terms a (passive) attack on a cryptosystem is any method  of starting with some information about plaintexts and their  corresponding ciphertexts under some (unknown) key, and figuring out  more information about the plaintexts. It's possible to state  mathematically what this means. Here we go.  Fix functions F, G, and H of n variables. Fix an encryption system E,  and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys.  An attack on E using G assuming F giving H with probability p is an  algorithm A with a pair f, g of inputs and one output h, such that  there is probability p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n), if we have  f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and g = G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)). Note that this  probability depends on the distribution of the vector (K,P_1,...,P_n).  The attack is trivial (or ``pointless'') if there is probability at  least p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n) if f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and  g = G(C_1,...,C_n). Here C_1,...,C_n range uniformly over the possible  ciphertexts, and have no particular relation to P_1,...,P_n. In other  words, an attack is trivial if it doesn't actually use the encryptions  E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n).  An attack is called ``one-ciphertext'' if n = 1, ``two-ciphertext'' if  n = 2, and so on.* What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically?  In basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure.  Read part 3: we keep saying ``a strong cryptosystem must have this  property, but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem  is strong!''  In contrast, the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely  formulate and, if possible, prove the statement that a cryptosystem is  strong. We say, for example, that a cryptosystem is secure against  all (passive) attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system (as  defined above) is too slow to be practical. If we can prove this  statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist  any (passive) cryptanalytic technique. If we can reduce this statement  to some well-known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that  the cryptosystem isn't easy to break.  Other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical  definition. Again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions  we're making and prove that they produce the desired results. We can  figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used  properly: it just means that the assumptions are valid.  The same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too. The cryptanalyst  can take advantage of incorrect assumptions. Often he can try to  construct a proof of security for a system, see where the proof fails,  and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis.  * Why is the one-time pad secure?  By definition, the one-time pad is a cryptosystem where the  plaintexts, ciphertexts, and keys are all strings (say byte strings)  of some length m, and E_K(P) is just the sum (let's say the exclusive  or) of K and P.  It is easy to prove mathematically that there are _no_ nontrivial  single-ciphertext attacks on the one-time pad, assuming a uniform  distribution of keys. Note that we don't have to assume a uniform  distribution of plaintexts. (Here's the proof: Let A be an attack,  i.e., an algorithm taking two inputs f, g and producing one output h,  with some probability p that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and  g = G(E_K(P)) (i.e., g = G(K + P)). Then, because the distribution of  K is uniform and independent of P, the distribution of K + P must also  be uniform and independent of P. But also the distribution of C is  uniform and independent of P. Hence there is probability exactly p  that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and g = G(C), over all P and C. Thus  a fortiori A is trivial.)  On the other hand the one-time pad is _not_ secure if a key K is used  for more than one plaintext: i.e., there are nontrivial  multiple-ciphertext attacks. So to be properly used a key K must be  thrown away after one encryption. The key is also called a ``pad'';  this explains the name ``one-time pad.''* What's a ciphertext-only attack?  In the notation above, a ciphertext-only attack is one where F is  constant. Given only some information G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)) about  n ciphertexts, the attack has to have some chance of producing some  information H(P_1,...,P_n) about the plaintexts. The attack is trivial  if it has just as good a chance of producing H(P_1,...,P_n) when given  G(C_1,...,C_n) for random C_1,...,C_n.  For example, say G(C) = C, and say H(P) is the first bit of P. We can  easily write down an attack---the ``guessing attack,'' which simply  guesses that H(P) is 1. This attack is trivial because it doesn't use  the ciphertext: it has a fifty-fifty chance of guessing correctly no  matter what. On the other hand there is an attack on RSA which  produces one bit of information about P, with 100% success, using C.  If it is fed a random C then the success rate drops to 50%. So this is  a nontrivial attack.* What's a known-plaintext attack?  The classic known-plaintext attack has F(P_1,P_2) = P_1,  G(C_1,C_2) = (C_1,C_2), and H(P_1,P_2) depending only on P_2.  In other words, given two ciphertexts C_1 and C_2 and one decryption  P_1, the known-plaintext attack should produce information about the  other decryption P_2.  Note that known-plaintext attacks are often defined in the literature  as producing information about the key, but this is pointless: the  cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him  decrypt further messages.* What's a chosen-plaintext attack?  A chosen-plaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical  series of _active_ attacks on a cryptosystem: attacks where the  cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor. These attacks don't fit into  our model of passive attacks explained above. Anyway, a  chosen-plaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and  look at the corresponding ciphertext, then repeat until he has figured  out how to decrypt any message. More absurd examples of this sort of  attack are the ``chosen-key attack'' and ``chosen-system attack.''  A much more important form of active attack is a message corruption  attack, where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a  way as to make a useful change in the plaintext.  There are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks:  for instance, automatically encrypting any plaintext P as  T,E_K(h(T+R+P),R,P), where T is a time-key (sequence number) chosen anew  for each message, R is a random number, and h is a one-way hash  function. Here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusive-or.* In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks?  Consider the following known-plaintext attack. We are given some  plaintexts P_1,...,P_{n-1} and ciphertexts C_1,...,C_{n-1}. We're  also given a ciphertext C_n. We run through every key K. When we find  K such that E_K(P_i) = C_i for every i < n, we print D_K(C_n).  If n is big enough that only one key works, this attack will succeed  on valid inputs all the time, while it will produce correct results  only once in a blue moon for random inputs. Thus this is a nontrivial  attack. Its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many  possible keys.* What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?  Say somebody is using the one-time pad---but isn't choosing keys  randomly and uniformly from all m-bit messages, as he was supposed to  for our security proof. In fact say he's known to prefer keys which  are English words. Then a cryptanalyst can run through all English  words as possible keys. This attack will often succeed, and it's much  faster than a brute-force search of the entire keyspace.",3

The whole tenor of thisrelease seems to be establishing a ground rule that only ""business"" useis legitimate for debate. If you want the nothings you drop in your wife'sear to remain secret and private, that is not even on the agenda for debate.Note that there is NO role for you to contain private info in this. The onlyreference is to information already in the hands of others. The 'unauthorizedrelease' bit is also drawing a long bow. Most of these cases are by people whohave legitimate access abusing it, and revealing, or often selling the info.These people are, of course, in this proposal, the people who will have thekeys.The criminals also use lawers, courts, the CIA, white-house officials and pensto go about their business.

Just makes sure that the illegal ones are preserved.Where do you find many experts. Any ex KGB people looking for a contract? :-)And as a later posting asks, what of the STU-IIIs they already have. It willbe very interesting to see if the military and US embasies start to use it.After all, it is secure, isn't it. The govt will answer that point by its ownactions.                                                ^^^^^^^^Again, personal use seems to be a unaskable question.                                                  ^^^^^Ah, so warrents are not always needed it seems.The ITARs seem to slightly impeed this.Note that all this wonderfull stuff will be in secret. Only the 'proper people'will be able to express an opinion, hence only the desired result will emerge.Encryption and codes have been around for millenia. They are generaly inequilibrium with the technology of the time. The systematic study of cyphershas resulted in a swing in favor of the encrypter, AT THE MOMENT. I have nodoubt that the factoring problem will fall in time. Probably fofr practicalpurposes by the middle of the next century.It is a little hard to critisise a non-proposal.Note we drop back to 'phone-mode' again. If this is a true answer, it can berephrased as "" It sucks big time. Anyone who can drive the crypt work-benchwill use it for light amusement before breakfast.""This link between the security of the key-eschrow, and the actual algorithm is a real winner.

"In reference to the limits of acceleration with guns launching solidrockets as payloads.  Thiokol provided me with samples and data ona reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations.  Solidmotor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of aluminum in the mix.  For example, the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percentAluminum.  The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure.The structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspectsome bubbling process is used to form it).  In other words, if you madea bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is whatyou get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires inall directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated intothe voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  Thefoamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant,so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The majorimprovement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is theprincipal failure mode for solid propellant.Dani Eder",6

"Many of you ask me whether I approve of severe human rightsviolations by Arab States becuse I focus on Israeli human rightsviolations.Let's make things clear: My opposition to H.R. violations in ArabStates is total and without qualification. No Arab State is and canclaim to be democratic. No Arab state claims to be democratic.I am born in Palestine (now Israel). I have family there. The lack ofpeace and utter injustice in my home country has affected me all my life.I am concerned by Palestine (Israel) because I want peace to come toit. Peace AND justice. If anybody has legitimate claims towards Arab states, he should presenthis claims and ask for support. Jews who left Arab states are fully entitled to make claims and should do so, if they consider their case hasa merit. It is their basic right to return to these countries, if theywish. If not, they should not complain and compare themselves to thePalestinians who have been struggling for the right of return sinceIsrael was established and whose right is upheld by the United Nationsquasi totally. If Jews feel discriminated in Arab countries, they have alegitimate claim that any decent person can and should support. Human rights violations by Arab States don't justify, legitimate norare the cause for Israeli breaches of international law and human rioghts.Israeli breaches stem from the Zionist concept, which can only beimplemented by negating basic rights to Palestinians. Israeli trights and Palestinian rights are not symmetrical. The firstparty has a state and the other has none. The first is an occupier andthe second the occupied. For any meaningful relationship to emerge, somesymmetry must be established. As long as Israelis and Jews don't realisethe necessity of a change of perspective towards the Palestinian peopleand as long as Israelis and Jews don't want to exorcise their ownpast towards the Palestinians (the Naqba of 1948, etc.) and refuse toacknowledge that the creation of Israel was dependent upon the removalof most Palestinian Arabs, there will be no base for a real trust.When I read the first time the list of the 383 Arab villagesdestroyed by the State of Israel in and after 1948, I got a shock.

"Stop! Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that the first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi party, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a redherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of the histories I've read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using homosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was thatHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuseofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your factsright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA ina coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations ofhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (itis possible that the histories I've read have not mentioned this, but I doubtit - would it be in Hitler's best interest to admit to the world that hisformer right hand man was a homosexual?). Anyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references to the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the night of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even the Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, this does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the 1920's.Ah, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell theparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with homosexuality (at least, not according to what I've read), I'd like to know what tainted ""evidence"" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made by persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those accusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the 1920's and 30's, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in time and plant ""tainted"" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers which were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being obvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matterdo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in these matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a false accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point here seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof falls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework before making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.This is just about the *only* thing we agree on. I suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and his SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feelingseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that thismust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is whatlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But thisis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If you really think that historians are so incompetent, why don't you write them and ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can't tell from their footnotes? I'm a graduate student in history. Writing to professors andtracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not myspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that wouldcast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I'm not going to waste my timetrying to debunk someone's paranoia. Do the research yourself.Given that you already consider all evidence ""tainted"", what on earth wouldconstitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars beenconsidered ""shrewd guesses""?I suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -historians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious footnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually provide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place to start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.I'll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already.

A not-overly critical but still useful overview of 32alternative health therapies.]  ...the Russian engineer Semyon Kirlian and his wife Valentina during the  1950s.  Using alternating currents of high frequency to 'illuminate'  their subjects, they photographed them.  They found that if an object  was a good conductor (such as a metal) the picture showed only its  surface, while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner  structure of the object even if it were optically opaque.  They found  too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead  and living objects.  Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones  were subject to changes.  The object's life activity was also visible in  highly variable colour patterns.  High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in  the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up  seriously.  Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips at  Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs and  others have been produced in Brazil, Austria and Germany.  Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around people's  fingers, notably around those of healers who are concentrating on  healing someone.  Normally, blue and white rays emanate from the fingers  but, when a subject becomes angry or excited, the aura turns red and  spotty.  The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose  diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method.  They argue that  in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person  isn't actually ill but is about to be.  They claim to be able to  foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase.  But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is  the phantom effect.  During high frequency photography of a leaf from  which a part had been cut, the photograph gave a complete picture of the  leaf with the removed part showing up faintly.  This is extremely  important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can 'see'  the legs of amputees as if they were still there.  The important thing  about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern  can't possibly represent a secondary phenomenon -- or the field would  vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished.  The energy grid  contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than  the actual object itself.  [...]  Kirlian photography has shown how water mentally 'charged' by a healer  has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water...From the incredulous side: [MacRobert, Alan, ""Reality shopping; aconsumer's guide to new age hokum."", _Whole Earth Review_, Autumn 1986,vNON4 p4(11).  An excellent article providing common-sense guidelines forevaluating paranormal claims, and some of the author's favorite examplesof hokum.]  The crank usually works in isolation from everyone else in his field of  study, making grand discoveries in his basement.  Many paranormal  movements can be traced back to such people -- Kirlian photography, for  instance.  If you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will  emit glowing sparks, common knowledge to electrical workers and  hobbyists for a century.  It took a lone basement crank to declare that  the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura.  In fact, Kirlian  photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists John O.  Pehek, Harry J. Kyler, and David L. Faust, who reported their findings  in the October 15, 1976, issue of Science.  Their conclusion: The  variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on  the surface of the body and not to mysterious ""auras"" or even  necessarily to changes in mood or mental state.  Nevertheless,  television shows, magazines, and books (many by famous  parapsychologists) continue to promote Kirlian photography as proof of  the unknown.",5

This is probably the longest  of my entire collection.________________________________________________________                                  So that the                                  Prophecy be                                   Fulfilled                                     * * *       In considering the Christian religion, and judging itaccording to its claims, it is important to look at its claims atfulfilling earlier Jewish prophecy.  The scribe Matthew is perhapsthe most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers inthe career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew's mainstrategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not evenabout the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances inthe New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of theauthenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written atleast 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how muchhappened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, wewill take particular claims at face value.Immanuel:       We begin, of course, at the beginning.       (Mt 1.21-22):  ""[Mary] will bear a son, and you,       Joseph, will name him 'Jesus' (which means G'd is       salvation), for he will save his people from their       sins.""  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had       spoken by a prophet:       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz       and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the       lord G'd said to Isaiah, ""go to meet with Ahaz...""        ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,       naturally) saying, ""Ask a sign of G'd your lord.  It       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.""  But,       Ahaz said, ""I won't ask; I will not put the lord to a       test.""  Then (Isaiah) said, ""Hear then, O house of       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman       is with child and will bear a son, and name him       ""Immanuel,"" which means, ""G'd is with us.""   He will       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings       you dread will have been deserted...Matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. Further, he the Hebrew word ""almah,"" (young woman), asspecifically, ""virgin.""  But, this is not a prophecy about theMessiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 yearslater.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  Inshort, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out ofcontext, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  Itshould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a generalmanner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,virgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,the fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of bylater Christians to be G'd walking among men, was never called bythe name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecyfor Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a secondclass prophecy.   Not too convincing.Egypt:       After Jesus's birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about aquick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if hewishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape analleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:       ""Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.""What the lord really said was this.       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him.        And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called       them (my people), the more they went from me; they       kept sacrificing to the Ba'als, and kept burning       incense to idols.Matthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea's oracle.  But, itwas indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted toreturn.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken ofhere.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we windup with a Jesus that flees and resists G'd.   Again, this prophecyis just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.Rachel Weeps:        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says thatKing Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions ofall young male children.  Matthew then writes,       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:       ""A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;       she refused to be consoled, because they were       no more.""   The reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to thecarrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722BCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,and Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are ""nomore.""  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and diesbefore the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, whowas the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus andBethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her ""children,""it is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem isthat the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,""on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).""       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikelythat such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but theevent is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. Herod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far lessevil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be aprime example of how events were added to Jesus's life to enhancethe message of the church's gospel.       Because of the whole story's similarity to the tale of theinfant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device setup by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.It is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mentionthe rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The ""children"" the prophetspeaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G'dcomforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will bereturned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, thiswould not suit Matthew's purpose, as the children he speaks of aredead for good.  Again, the ""prophecy"" Matthew sets up is not eventhat, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not tooconvincing.The Nazarene:       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to findanother Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wifetake the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth,        [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets       might be fulfilled, ""He shall be called a Nazarene.""First thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name ofthe prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who ""He"" is. There are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,there are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Stillworse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament atall.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson's mother thatshe will,       [Judges 13.5]  ""...conceive and bear a son.  No razor       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel       from the hands of the Philistines.""This is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G'd. But, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew hasbegun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he issimple making them up now.Bearing ourDiseases:       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnessesand disabilities.       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the       prophet Isaiah, ""He took our infirmities and bore our       diseases.""As expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,and a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.From a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know thatthe prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nationof Israel, Jehovah's chosen servant and people.  He speaks to theIsraelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nationsthat look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewishidentity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as theinstrument of the nations' salvation by G'd.      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses whichare the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt anddiscipline.  They do not speak of a ""servant"" going around andhealing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on thesicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,as we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  Theverses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, butrather something that had already happened.  While it is believedthat Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bearthe illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to saythat, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in hisspiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew's parallelmisses where he intended it to have its effect.Silent Messiah:      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesusordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn't arousethe attention of the local rulers.       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by       the prophet Isaiah.          ""Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his       name.""The Isaiah passage quoted reads,       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands       await his law.You see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,because it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians couldnever think of Jesus failing, never would the ""light"" of mankindburn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come toan end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embraceG'd there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all willbe the children of G'd.  Also, the ending phrase has been changedfrom the Judaic ""...the coastlands await his law."" to theChristologic, ""the Gentiles will hope in his name.""   While theoriginal proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites itto fit its strange doctrine of ""believing in the name.""  If onehas any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has onlyto read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the belovedbut blind and imperfect servant, ""a people robbed andplundered...""   So, we see that when Matthew's attempt at""prophecy"" is examined, it crumbles.Three Days andThree Nights:      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the verymouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion andresurrection.       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and       three nights.Before any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to knowhow the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset6pm.  What was referred to as a ""day"" was the period of light from6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our timescale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate theirsabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. (It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn't forget thatSaturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,when days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylightportions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,Jesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwiseunresurrected for three days and three nights.      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the ""ninthhour,"" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into thegrave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, ""rose,""before dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath wasover).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time forclarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pmFriday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this meansusing Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, twonights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly thisis a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way weare even able to have his death involve three days and threenights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led tosuspect that this error is another one of Matthew's littlemistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into hisgod's mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is morethan unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.Hearing &Understanding:     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences inparables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, ifyou were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand themessage of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand theparables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understandthem, there is no need to bother with them, since they will notaccept the ""plain"" message any better.  Matthew says,       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says,        ""You will indeed hear but never understand; and you       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this       people's heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal       them.""The original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, hiscall to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel isflourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. Isaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G'd,calling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.       [Is 6.9-13]  And G'd said, ""Go, and say to this       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and       see, but do not perceive.'   Make the heart of this       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and       turn and be healed.""  Then Isaiah said, ""How long,       lord?""  And he said, ""Until the cities lie waste       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the       land is utterly desolate, and the G'ds take men far       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still       stands when the tree is felled."" The holy seed is its       stump.Here we see that it is really G'd who causes the people of Israelto stop listening to the prophet's warnings, but reaffirms thepromise made to Solomon's (and David's) seed/lineage.  If you readthe rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the planof G'd to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Lookat Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portionof Isaiah's verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,he has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn'tunderstand Jesus's stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah's verses arenot prophecies, but rather commands from G'd to him, in thepresent.   Once again, Matthew's prophecy falls flat on its face.      Matthew tries again to make Jesus's parables look like theyhave the prophetic approval.       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the       prophet, ""I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I       will utter that which has been hidden since the       foundation of the world.""Matthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from aprophet, but from the Psalms.       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us.        We will not hide them from their children, but tell to       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the       lord...As was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really comefrom a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copiesof Matthew's gospel even inserted Isaiah's name as this prophet. Apparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover someof it up.     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, onceagain, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesushas said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will notunderstand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. Further, they speak of things ""known, that our fathers have toldus.""  Jesus deals with things ""hidden since the foundation of theworld.""  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. This is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  Nowonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,Matthew's artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,Christians rarely look at this.  Matthew's prophecies aren't theonly things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.Excuses ofLittle Faith:       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to goaround casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing whatepilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease werepossesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples wereunable to ""dispossess"" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no moreenlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, sayingthey didn't have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was thisdemon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith orhe does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to movemountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that canmove real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles theCharismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips toMexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some oldwoman's arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded inancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in theirsacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding inheaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return andtheir great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.       Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant timeor a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in theold days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All thetheologians give are various excuses as to why we don't get to seeGod anymore.       We're too lazy; we're not zealous enough; we're       sinful; it's just his ""plan""; we put too many of our       own demands on G'd's appearance; if we had the right       faith, if we  were willing to meet G'd on his terms...     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G'd.  You, dearreader, have not seen G'd.  Not literally, you know that to betrue. (I know that's presumptuous and bold.  But, searching yourheart, you know what I mean.)  All that we've seen religions do ismake people feel good and content about not seeing G'd.  They sayour little faith does not merit us to see G'd.  Sometimes, theysay, ""See the love in these people you worship with... see thelives of people change... that is seeing G'd.""   Thus people getlulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G'd into the everydaysights.   But, that is not seeing G'd as I am speaking of... it isnot seeing G'd the way people used to see.        What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion ofhuman hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, theforgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty createdby the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these arewhat we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybodyhas little faith.Jesus Rides onan Ass:       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiahking, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride intoJerusalem.         [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken       by the prophet, saying,       Tell the daughter of Zion, ""Behold, your king is       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a       ass-colt.""Of course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a littledifferently.       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-       colt... he will command peace to the nations.There isn't all that much difference here, except that Zechariahonly involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads thepoetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call forboth a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew's version, we get acomical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle twodonkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,proctological dilemma!   We find that in the account writtenearlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought toJesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, andshows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he hasbungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, Ihave noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,the situation is often reversed nowadays...       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests wereangered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,Jesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,       [Mt 21.16]  Haven't you read?  `Out of the mouth of       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.'It is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesuswas never one to point out such little ""prophetic"" things ANDsince, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems tofit Matthew's track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus orMatthew, ""Haven't you read?"" for the source reads,       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the       enemy and the avenger.The passages hardly need comment.  There is no ""perfect praise""spoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G'd,not his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to bejust one more case of Matthew's pen making up convenient propheticscripture.YHVH said to my lord...:      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewishmessiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is kingDavid.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,       ""The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until       I put your enemies under your feet.""Taken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidicdescent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Ofcourse, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying tomake some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divinenature of the messiah-king.  It's tempting to believe this, if oneis a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. But, there are problems.       In Jesus's time, the psalm was thought to be about themessiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to themessiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scripturesabout the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,bringing the Jews to times even better than those under David'srule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and thepassage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as theChristians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of thispsalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus's time hadalso made.  One must remember that there were various factionsamong the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of themessiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, likehis audience, who thought the messiah's advent was imminent, andwho interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.What is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,       YHVH's utterance to my lord:	""Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your       footstool.""       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the       holy mountains.         ""You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek       forever.""The word ""lord"" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christianbibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, theword is ""adoni,"" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means""lord,"" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often inthe scriptures to refer to kings and to G'd.  It is merely anaddress of respect.        There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the wordrefers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this issupposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of thepsalm translates to either ""a psalm of David,"" or ""a psalm aboutDavid.""  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a courtpoet, about David's covenant and endorsement from G'd.  If thepsalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would betalking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descendedfrom David, was not present in David's age.  We have extensivetales of David's doings and sayings-- none of which include anypraises of a messiah.     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long afterDavid was dead, in times of the exile when G'd had put his show offavour for David's kingdom on hold.       The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David waspromised by G'd a rise to power, victory over his enemies,successful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achievedthe priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,enabled to bless the people.   It all fits.      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,though.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, thoughhis use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, thisevent is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew offa little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,though, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel ofMark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. Matthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition ofan infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus's question.  As wemight expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up byembarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.Moses & Jesus,Had it TogetherAll Along...:       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see apseudo-prophecy in John's gospel.  The gospel story of Johndeserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removedfrom the real events of Jesus's career as told by even Matthew. But, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The earlychurch leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiahking, and on an artificial extension of the original promises madeby G'd.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote ofa promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While thiswas accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, theChristians who came along later decided that they would claim thefulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on thepromise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.It would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,Abraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. I have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testamentwhich corresponds to John's little prophecy.  It is par for thecourse to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just likehis forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith hasmany of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising theystill cling to it.The Potter'sField:      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem byone of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief       priests, taking the silver, said, ""It isn't lawful for       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood       money.""  So they... bought a potter's field with it to       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,       ""And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter's       field, as the lord directed me.""This prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old TestamentScripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the nameof the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses whichMatthew makes use of.       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, ""Cast       them to the treasury,"" --the lordly price at which I       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of       YHVH.First of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayerof the messiah, or of G'd.  The deal with a shepherd, most likelya priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the peopleshortly before G'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict withone another.  The word, ""treasury,"" had been replaced by the KingJames Scholars with ""to the potter,"" precisely because this madeMatthew's quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  Thecorrect translation of the Hebrew is indeed ""treasury,"" which alsomakes perfect sense in Zechariah's context, whereas ""potter'sfield"" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation wasintentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, givenMatthew's track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion ofintentional dishonesty.      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering thetext.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas's situation, and ifas most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregardthe contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy totoss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariahdirectly contradicts the situation with Judas and the highpriests.  The high priests would not put the money in thetreasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly theopposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,the ""prophecy"" as presented by Matthew would be taken at NewTestament face value.  To those, Matthew's work is convincingenough.Wine, Vinegar,& Casting Lots:      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,       ""They parted my garments among them, and upon my       vesture did they cast lots.""First of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sourwine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We findthat right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give himsome to drink --not polluted with gall.       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, ""I thirst.""  A bowl of       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he       had received the vinegar, he said, ""It is finished;""But, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from theprophets, but one from the Psalms.       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the       Book of the Living.Of course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his requestof drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalmquoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  Itis not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising thatwe run into further problem when we see that the ""Jesus"" in thepsalm asks G'd for the damnation of the ""crucifiers,"" whereas theJesus of the gospels says,       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, ""Father, forgive them, the       don't know what they do!""Further, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy byhaving gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus's drink, not hismeat, as the psalm stipulates.       With the ""prophecy"" of the vinegar faulty, we naturallyask, ""What of the casting of lots?""  This brings up the 22ndPsalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now tosay that the fact that Jesus's clothes were divided as told is nogreat thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felonin those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the leasterroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It doesindeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality ofJesus's clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises somesuspicions.The 22nd Psalm:      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of hiscondition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song ofpraise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of itseem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  Wewill examine the primary passages.       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?!        Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you       don't answer, and by night, but find no rest.Jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. This suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, ratherthan king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does notfit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured ascomplaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like ""thelamb led mute before its shearers.""  Indeed, Jesus doesn't do muchgroaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry byboth day and night on the cross.       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men...        All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag       their heads;  ""He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let       him deliver him... for he delights in him.""This seems to fit Jesus's execution pretty well, with theexception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!It would seem quite convincing, and I'm sure the early Christianfathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,this prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words ""have pierced"" reallydo not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my       hands and feet...In Hebrew the phrase ""like the lion"" and a very rare verb formwhich can mean ""pierced"" differ by one phonetic character.  Theword in the Hebrew text is literally, ""like the lion"" (ka'ari),which makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animalimagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience thatwould urge a Christian to change the word to ""ka'aru.""   But, toadd the needed (yet artificial) weight to the ""prophecy"" this isjust what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While thecorrect translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring toJesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of thetranslators.       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lenditself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer beingsaved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits thepsalm's true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now knowthat crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but ratherthe forearms.  This doesn't say much in favour of the traditionalthought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars onhis palms.  But then, facts aren't bound by our religious beliefs.      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does notattempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lordJesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of allthe gospel writers when they compiled the stories andinterpretations of Jesus's life and death.  How much thesescriptures may have contributed to what actually got written downis a question that has serious repercussions for Christiantheology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithfulfundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament mighthave been ""enhanced"" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scripturalmatters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said goodthings for St. Matthew.The reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus'scrucifixion.  John's gospel recount, written about 70 years afterthe fact, tells us at Jesus's execution,       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...       ""The will look on him whom they've pierced.""Of course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out ofcontext.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation ofIsrael will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war withthem.       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him       like you weep over a firstborn child.John's attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker thatMatthew's attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts morethan just one passage.  John's errors are grossly obvious andblatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospelwriters, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of theirreligion were founded.Reckoned withTransgressors:       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claimingthe Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version ofthe gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the       scripture was fulfilled which says,       ""He was reckoned with the transgressors.""Here, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,about the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about themessiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and itssurrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  Theverses are also about what this servant has gone through in thepast, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  Theservant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit thedescription of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about themessiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus betweentwo thieves would fulfill the ""prophecy"" in Isaiah.  Jesus wouldmore fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He wasconsidered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout hiscareer.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way tosteal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark couldhave had made a better analogy with general comparisons.       Mark goes on to tell us how ""those who were crucified with[Jesus] also reviled him."" [15.32]  This is to be expected from acouple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Lukedecides to change some things.  Luke tells us,       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged       with him railed, ""Aren't you the messiah?! Save       yourself, and us!""This certainly fits with Mark's recount, which tells how thepeople who crucified Jesus said, ""Save yourself!"" and that therobbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,       ""Don't you fear G'd, since you are under the same       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds.        But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,       ""Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.""        And Jesus answered, ""Verily I say to you, today you       will be with me in paradise.""Now, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretchesthe imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebukinghis fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a ratherstrange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of hispunishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,apparently noble and of principle, doesn't seem likely to havebeen a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created byLuke.  Of course, Luke's recount also disagrees with Mark's.  Luke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easyenough to discount the discrepancy because the account was madeup, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error freewords of G'd do not have this avenue open.  This is yet anotherexample of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage andexpand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we haveseen.The End of theWorld--       Mt. 24:       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary andembarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in allthree of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the mostunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesusmentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, andhis disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the worldwhich he has been warning about.       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple's       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your       coming, and of the close of the age?       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for       many will come in my name, saying, ""I am the christ.""         ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the       beginning of the birthpangs.             They will deliver you up... put you to death,       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to       the mountains.             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out       his angels... and gather his elect...             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these       things, you will know that He is near, at the very       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not       pass away until all these things take place...             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming       at an hour you do not expect.From this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would inwithin the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tellsthem that although he doesn't know the exact day or hour, that itwill come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wettheir pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. But, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told hisdisciples that their generation would still be around at the End,and that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to beswept away.      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrantnature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, ""this generationshall not pass away..."" really means ""this race of people will notpass away...""  Of course, the word for generation is used manytimes to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. It is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,he didn't learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it isquite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (atleast some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. The charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by lookingat the Apostles' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear fromRev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesusmeant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24thchapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000years, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,hearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. Surely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine howtired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting forjust the right moment to spring?       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, orthree days and three nights, or three periods of time, or threeeternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes forless trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divineradiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn't in the bestinterests of his new religion to stick around, and thereforedisappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. As has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus whenpeople got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,Jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We haveseen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughoutChurch history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simplebelief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved withargumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept awayfrom question.  To question and investigate has never been theeasiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, theprophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largelyaccepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. Pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianityhave been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to supportwars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of whichChristianity can securely keep hold.",0

"As promised, below is a personal critique of a Pressure Point Massager I recently bought from the Self Care Catalog.  I am very pleased with the results.  The catalog description is as follows:	The Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager 	that actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like a	professional shiatsu masseur.  The powerful motor drives two	counter-rotating ""thumbs"" that move in one-inch orbits --	releasing tension in the neck, back, legs and arms.

When I received it, I glanced thru the newer catalogenclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one.  I was  QUITE annoyed to see a $70 difference in price.  I called them about it,and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers, although itlooks and works exactly the same.  He told me to go ahead and return thefirst one and order the cheaper one, using the price difference as areason for return.  In fact, since the newer ones might take a while toship from the factory (I received this one in 3 days), he told me I could use the one I already have until the new one arrives, then return the old one.  VERY reasonable people.********I have long-term neck, shoulder and back pain (if I were a building, I would be described as ""structurally unsound :-) ).  I have stretches and exercises to do that help, but the problem never really goes away.  If, for whatever reason, I do not exercise for a while (illness, not enoughtime, lazy, etc.), the muscles become quite stiff and painful and, thus, more prone to further strain.  Even with exercise, I sometimes require physical therapy to get back on track, which 1st requires a doctor visit to get the prescription for p.t.  The tension in my neck, if not released, eventually causes a headache(sometimes confused with a sinus headache) over my left eye.  When my physical therapist has massaged my neck, and the sub-occipital muscles in particular (the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull), the headache usually eased within a day, although it hurts like hell to while it is being massaged.I ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishingsomeone would invent --a machine that would massage, NOT VIBRATE, my neck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in the past, that I could use by myself.  No doctor visit or inconvenient p.t. appts for a week later would be needed to use it.  I could get up in the middle of the night and use it, if necessary.I have been using it for about a week or so now, and LOVE it.  The baseunit is about a 14"" x 9"" rectangle, about 3-3/4"" high, with handles on eachside, and it plugs into an average outlet.  The two metal ""thumbs"" are about 1-1/2"" in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2"" above the base.  The thumbs are covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable.  They are located more toward one end, rather than centered (see figure below).  They move in either clockwise or counter-clockwise directions, depending on which side of the switch is pushed, and are very quiet.  It can be used from eitherside.  For instance, the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neckor the top of the neck, depending on which direction you approach it.                 _______________________________                |  __    _______________    __  |                | |  |  |		|  |  | |                | |  |  |  \^^/   \^^/  |  |  | |                | |  |  |   ||     ||   |  |  | |                | |  |  |		|  |  | |                | |  |  |_______________|  |  | |                | |__|			   |__| |                |_______________________________|For the neck/head, the user varies the amount of pressure used by (if laying down) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and/or neck to rest on the thumbs.  The handles can also be used if sitting orstanding, applying pressure with the arms/wrists.  Since my wrists arealso impaired (I'm typing this over an extended period of time), and I don't have someone living with me who can apply it, laying down works well for me.For my back, I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair, position the massagerbehind me at whatever point I want massaged, and lean back lightly (ornot so lightly) against it.  The pressure of leaning back holds it in place.  If I want to massage the entire spine, I simply move it down a few inches whenever I feel like it.  For my back, this machine is far superior to use than the commonly used ""home-made"" massager of 2 tennis balls taped together (with the balls, position (against a wall or door) them over the spine and move the body up and down against them).  The tennis balls are better than nothing, but difficult to use for very long, especially if your quads are not in good shape, and my long hair gets (painfully) in the way if I don't pin it up first.  As far as I'm concerned, the easier something like this is to use, the more likely I'll use/do it.  If there are multiple considerations/hassles, I'm more likely to not bother with it.Not only has this machine helped with my headaches, but my range of motion for my neck and back are greatly increased.  The first time I used it on myneck/sub-occipital muscles, however, I overdid it and pressed too hardagainst it, which resulted in a very tender, almost bruised area for afew days.  I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice, which helped.  After that, I was more gradual about applying pressure.  At this point, the pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged.  I also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back, which is the most vulnerable point for me.It also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades,although, again, it took a few days of massaging (just a few minutes ata time) to really work it out.I highly recommend this product if you have similar problems, although Icannot vouch for its durability (it seems pretty sturdy), since I've hadit such a short time.  I plan to use it not only to ease tension, but also to loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising (and maybe after, too).  I havebeen ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks, so this was very timely  for me.This is the 1st product I've ordered from this company and only recentlybecame aware of it thru a co-worker.  The catalog states they have beenin business since 1976.  It contains quite a few health care products and,while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalogproducts, they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thoughtput into what they actually do.  Definitely a step above some other onesI've seen such as ""Dr. Leonards Health Care Catalog"" or ""Mature Wisdom"".I'm only 37, but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists (nobig surprise here :-) ).  I consider many of those products to be rip-offs, particularly targeted toward the elderly, with dubious health benefits.I apologize for the length of this, but it's the kind of info _I_ would like to know before ordering something thru the mail.",5
"I will again *repeat* my statement: 1) I *do not* condone these *indiscriminate* Israeli acts (nor have I *ever*, 2) If the villagers do not know who these ""guerillas"" are (which you stated earlier), how do you expect theIsraelis to know? It is **very** difficult to ""identify"" who they are (this*is why* the ""guerillas"" prefer to lose themselves in the general population by dressing the same, acting the same, etc.).I agree; but, because Lebanon was either unwilling or unable to stop theseattacks from its territory should Israel simply sit quietly and accept itssituation? Israel asked the Lebanese government over and over to controlthis ""third party state"" within Lebanese territory and the attacks keptoccuring. At **what point** does Israel (or ANY state) have the right to dosomething ITSELF to stop such attacks? Never?It is also the responsibility of *any* state to NOT ALLOW *any* outsideparty to use its territory for attacks on a neighboring state. If 1) Angolahad the power, and 2) South Africa refused (or couldn't) stop anti-Angolanguerillas based on SA soil from attacking Angola, and 3) South Africarefused to have UN troops stationed on its territory between it and Angola,would Angola be justified in entering SA? If not, are you saying thatAngola HAD to accept the situation, do NOTHING and absorb the attacks?I refered above *at all times* to the Palestinian attacks on Israel fromLebanese soil, NOT to Lebanese attacks on Israel. One hopes that a Lebanese government will be strong enough to patrol its border but there is NO reason to believe it will be any stronger. WHAT HAS CHANGED is that the PLO was largely *driven out* of Lebanon (not by the Lebanese, not by Syria) and THAT is by far the most important making it EASIER to control future Palestinian attacks from Lebanese soil. That**change** was brought about by Israeli action; the PLO would *never*have been ejected by Lebanese, Arab state or UN actions. I fully recognize that the Lebanese do NOT WANT to be ""used"" by EITHER side,and have been (and continue to be). But the most fundamental issue is thatif a state cannot control its borders and make REAL efforts to do so, itshould expect others to do it for them. Hopefully that ""other"" will bethe UN but it is (as we see in its cowardice regarding Bosnia) weak.",9

"I hope this will clear it up :(Taken from one of my lecture notes) "" ...  The alternative approach (to CISC), which has been adopted by many in recent years, has come to be known as ""RISC"": the Reduced Instruction Set Computer.  This can be characterised simply as ""Simpler is Faster""; by simplifying the design (e.g.  by reducing the variety of instructions & addressing modes), the hardware can be designed to run faster.  Even at the cost of needing more instructions, the same task can be done more quickly by the simpler, faster design. A typical RISC processor will:    o provide a large number of registers (e.g.  32);    o perform all data operations on registers;    o provide few addressing modes (e.g. immediate or 'register + offset');    o only allow load & store operations to access memory;    o only use a few instruction formats;    o only support a few data types (e.g. integer, unsigned, floating).",12

"{Description of ""External Tank"" option for SSF redesign deleted}Yo Ken, let's keep on-top of things! Both the ""External Tank"" and""Wingless Orbiter"" options have been deleted from the SSF redesignoptions list. Today's (4/23) edition of the New York Times reportsthat O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals havebeen dropped, such as using the ""giant external fuel tanks usedin launching space shuttles,"" and building a ""station aroundan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.""Currently, there are three options being considered, as presentedto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported intoday's Times).Option ""A"" - Low Cost Modular ApproachThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,there are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supportingthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC andReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respectiveteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of thisoption are:  -  Uses ""Bus-1"", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that's     qualified for STS and ELV's. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this     for the Air Force.  -  A ""Power Station Capability"" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle     flies in an ""arrow mode"" to optimize the microgravity environment.     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power     source for 30 day missions.  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International     Partners' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and     add another 20 kW of power  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return     Vehicle).Option ""B"" - Space Station Freedom DerivedThe Option ""B"" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.This option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which wehave all come to know and love :)This option assumes a lightweight external tank is available foruse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option ""A""). Also, the number of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,for both options ""A"" and ""B"".The build-up occurs in six phases:  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when     it visits.  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).  -  A ""Two Fault Tolerance Capability"" is achieved after 14 flights,     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the     assembly in 24 flights.Most of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, with the exception of the data management system, which has majorchanges.",6

"The FLYERS team that can beat any team on any night showed up at the SpectrumSunday night, and dominated the Maple Leafs thoroughly en route to a 4-0shutout. Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout, but he barely brokea sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs frommounting any serious attack.Injuries:Pelle Eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh.Roster Moves:Jason Bowen was added to the lineup for his first NHL game. Jason was the FLYERSsecond pick in the first round (15th overall) of the 1992 entry draft. 19 yearsold, 6'4"", 210 lbs. In 62 games with the tri-city Americans he had 10 goals,12 assists and 219 PIM. He plays left wing and defense, he played defense inthis game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use himup front as well.Andre Faust was returned to Hershey. He actually left after the second periodof the Kings game, flew to Albany, got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win,and played again for Hershey Sunday night.Lines:Fedyk-Lindros-RecchiBeranek-Brind'Amour-DineenLomakin-Butsayev-ConroyActon-BrownGalley-McGillYushkevich-CroninCarkner-HawgoodBowenTommy Soderstrom in goal.Acton replaced Lomakin in the 3rd period.Game Summary:If the FLYERS played like this every night, they'd be in the playoffs thisyear. The FLYERS hit everything that moved. They created scoring chance afterscoring chance. They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do.Jason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal.He had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone, but insteadof taking the shot he found Brind'Amour crashing the net on the other side.A perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa's body should have been agoal, but Puppa made a great save reading the play.Garry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance whenhe hooked Doug Gilmour at 4:25. The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killingunit was almost flawless the entire game, and set the tone on this kill. TheMaple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots, and the defense sweptaway every rebound.After the power play, the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play. Rod Brind'Amourgave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point, and he sent a drive at thenet. Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of JosefBeranek and Bob Rouse, who were wrestling in the slot. Beranek was able toget his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating intothe slot from the right circle, and he lifted a backhander over Puppa fora 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8:10.The FLYERS kept the pressure on, and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERSfrom building on their lead for a while. Eventually things settled down anddefense prevailed. Each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalieswere strong. Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners.Then Lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him, thought he hada chance to even the score. He had Foligno lined up at center ice, leaned intohim, and rode him into the center ice boards. The only problem was that Folignowas a little far from the boards, and Mike ""Mister"" McGeough felt that itwarranted a boarding call at 15:38The Leafs couldn't get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS werevery aggressive (for a change) on the kill.With time running out in the period, Recchi carried through the neutral zoneand handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf's blue line. They were ina crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun, Lindros tried a backhand passto Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi, but then Clarkchecked Recchi off the puck. Macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak andwent right to McGill who had manned the point. He drove it from just insidethe blue line. Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his owngoalie at 19:55.1. Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period.The FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuktripped up Rod Brind'Amour in his offensive zone. During the power play, theFLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Ericgloved it down, but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head. Wecould see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his gloveand the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. As time wasrunning out in the advantage, Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goalmouth but Puppa made the save. The rebound kicked back to the right corner whereRecchi picked it up, passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle,and Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55. With the assist, Recchi moves pastBobby Clarke's 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a FLYER at117.  Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points.Mike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance onthe power play. Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play witha slash at 9:19. Not much happened on the 4 on 4, although the Leafs had mostof the possession. The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play. Tempersflared a little at 13:14. Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors, Keith Actongot a bloody face. Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood ahooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. The replay showed that Hawgood'sstick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell.Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play, led by Dimitri Yushkevich.Bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson. Berehowskitried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. He had the puck at the point,and just trickled a pass down the slot. He made all the FLYERS look silly asnobody could get a stick on it, and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net,but Soderstrom stoned him.The FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didn'tget anything home. Shots were 13-10 FLYERS.The FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and theydecided that if Tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it alittle.The FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of theperiod, but couldn't get past Puppa. Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros makingroad kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros (unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill (roughing)all at 7:02. Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour.Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play.At about the 12 minute mark, Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his leftcircle that got through Soderstrom. The puck was rolling on it's side, andas luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towardsit (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or theother). Seconds later Rod Brind'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12:24 to give theLeafs another chance on the power play. On the advantage, after Soderstromstoned Andreychuk while lying down, Andreychuk got the rebound throughSoderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was sweptaway by one of his defensemen. They kept the pressure on, but Soderstrom wasequal and preserved the shutout.Recchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawlat 16:01. No punches thrown, Recchi got the initial minor, KrushelnyskiBaumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors. At 17:02 Rouse and Beranekexpressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing toset up another 4 on 4. Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERSzone as they were battling for the puck, and while McGill was down he ranhis stick across McGill's face. The FLYERS were not happy with that at all.5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski, and started throwing punches.Upward. Well, Al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. Each gota couple punches in before going down in a head, and Al got a standing O!Penalties: Eastwood 5 (cross check) + game, Clark, Carkner 10 each. Berehowskiand Conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17:49.So a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS. The had no interestin stting on the lead. Hawgood, Galley and Brind'Amour played catch untilHawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck andblasted it past Puppa at 18:39.That was all the fireworks, Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot. Puppadid, but kept the FLYERS off the board. 4-0 FLYERS, shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the3rd. Probably the strongest game I've seen from the FLYERS since the All Starbreak. Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom, all since 1/10. Tied for 2nd most inthe NHL, but he's played fewer games than Belfour (6) or the goalie I can'tremember that he's tied with.Next up it's the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannotbe eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an Islander win that nightin Washington would be the official end.FLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. Last year they had 75 pointsin 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6games to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is betterthan 5 under in 80).Tragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. The tragic number for 5this 5 points, I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home tolose 5-4 before I finished this up. Why 5 points instead of 4? Well, the FLYERSwill win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the Islanders win tiebreakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie. The Rangers could crumbledown the stretch as they play the Devils, the Pens twice, the FLYERS, andfinish up with 2 games against the Caps. So I guess 5th place could be thegoal for the team to focus on.FLYERS team record watch:Eric Lindros:38 goals, 29 assists, 67 points(rookie records)club record goals:			club record points:Eric Lindros	38 1992-93		Dave Poulin	76 1983-84Brian Propp	34 1979-80		Brian Propp	75 1979-80Ron Flockhart	33 1981-82		Ron Flockhart	72 1981-82Dave Poulin	31 1983-84		Eric Lindros	67 1992-93Bill Barber	30 1972-73		Pelle Eklund	66 1985-86Mark Recchi:51 goals, 66 assists, 117 points.club record goals:			club record points:Reggie Leach	61 1975-76		Bobby Clarke	119 1975-76Tim Kerr	58 1985-86,86-87	Mark Recchi	117 1992-93Tim Kerr	54 1983-84,84-85	Bobby Clarke	116 1974-75Mark Recchi	51 1992-93		Bill Barber	112 1975-76Rick Macliesh	50 1972-73		Bobby Clarke	104 1972-73Bill Barber	50 1975-76		Rick Macliesh	100 1972-73Reggie Leach	50 1979-80FLYERS career years:Player		Points	Best Prior SeasonMark Recchi	117	113 (90-91 Penguins)Rod Brind'Amour	79	77 (91-92 FLYERS)Garry Galley	58	38 (84-85 Kings)Brent Fedyk	58	35 (90-91 Red Wings)That's all for now...",2

"A nice formulation for the introduction of the first encryptiondevices with built-in trapdoors - just like the Feds wanted...Bla-bla.Indeed, and the current proposal does nothing to prevent the latter.This doesn't say much. There are many incredibly weak encryptionalgorithms in commercial use today...Except from the government.Nope. The criminals won't be stupid enough to use the new chip,they'll use something secure. This technology provides only means tointercept the phone conversations of people who are stupid enough touse it.That is, the government has the keys. It doesn't matter much if theyare in one or in two of its hands...Correct. It does, however, provide those Americans with the falsesense of privacy.If the screening is not public, it cannot be trusted. Some people donot trust DES even today, after all the examinations - only becausesome parts of its design were kept secret.So they'll use a different technology to hide their illegalactivities. So will those law-abiding citizens, who do not trust theirgovernment not to misuse its abilities to decrypt their conversations.Except from the government.Huh? Later it says that the new technology will be export restricted.In short, the new technology can:1) Protect the law abiding citizen's privacy from the casual snooper.It cannot:1) Protect him from the government, if it decides to misuse itsability to decrypt the conversations.2) Protect him from the criminals who succeed to break the newencryption scheme or to steal the keys, or to bribe the people whohandle them, etc.3) Prevent the criminals from using secure encryption forcommunication.Correct. However, it does not provide them that much privacy as itclaims.Two candidates: the NSA and the Mafia.That is, ""trust us"".""Security through obscurity"".If it's not entirely open to public examination, it cannot betrusted. Besides, who can prove that the devices used for examinationand the ones built into your phones will be the same?The NSA and the FBI?Why did they ""forget"" the Academia?Doesn't this smell to monopolism?Like the Mafia?This is the main question, why was it buried at the end?""We'll see"".""Trust us"".In short, ""If we decide to outlaw strong crypto, we'll tell you"".Since the US government seems to consider strong crypto as munitionsand since the US constitutions guarantees the right to every Americanto bear arms, why is not every American entitled, as a matter ofright, to an unbreakable commercial encryption product?Bullshit. The proposed technology provides a false sense of security,encryption devices with built-in capabilities for breaking theencryption, does not prevent the criminals to use strong crypto, andis a step to outlaw strong crypto.Who was the optimist who believed that the new administration willleave the export controls on strong crypto devices?OK, I'm not American, it's not my business, but I just couldn't resistto comment...

Why wouldn't they have ""goneout in the proverbial blaze of glory"" and ""come out shooting"" with an attitudeof ""let's take as many of those dogs as possible with us""?Instead, they seemed to have preferred death to whatever they thought was instore for them at the government's hands.It's totally immaterial whether they were all crazy, all fanatics, all followersof the antichrist, haters of the government, practicers of weird lifestyles, orwhatever...they must have felt that they were being pressured into renouncingtheir beliefs, however how strange or lunatic those beliefs might appear to ""youand me"". There is much precedent for such devotion to cause.My conclusion at this point is that the ""authorities"" seriously misread theirdanger to society (else why did the BD's not do as suggested above) and/or chosethis incident to make some heinous point or satisfy some internal agenda, up toand including AG J. Renbo using this as an opportunity to assert her manhood.Some people really do believe it is better to die than be subjected to whatthey perceive as the godless government.

"True, but maybe not the worst possible - see Algeria.  This was true (and I may add the adjective ""stupid"") until the Intifada.Since then, no serious Israeli leader (including Shamir) really thinksthe the occupied territories worth the trouble.

The best thing the Palestinians can do for themselves these days is to stop the Intifadaand try to live as normally as possible (I know, it's hard under occupation).Otherwise people might think that five years of stone throwing (as justifiedas it may be) has caused the Palestinians an irreversible damage that prevents them from running a normal state when the time comes.

In a human sence, you can have big purposes.But the influence of Aristotle, Confucious, Alexander, Ceasar andcountless others is still with us, although their works have perished.But they have changed to course of history, and while humanity exists,their deeds cannot be said to have come to nothing, even if theyare utterly forgotten.One day, surely. (well, unless you believe in the Second Coming, whichI do not)But in that time we can make a difference.In the end. But it must be the end; until then, there is all thepoint you can muster. And when that end comes, there will be nobodyto ask, ""Gee, I don't think James Sledd's deeds are gonna makemuch of a difference, ulitmately, ya know?"".But they will have already have made a difference, great or small,before the end.Why must your ends be eternal to be worthwhile?Little is in the eye of the beholder, of course.I don't doubt it. But I have thought about the cosmic scale. Andit does not seem to mean much to us, here, today.I would not find this comforting. But perhaps it is merely mydefinitions. Here's what I think the relevant terms are:""Reality""	That which is real.""Illusion""	That which is not real, but seems to be.""Real""		Objectively ExistingFor ""reality"" to be an ""illusion"" would mean, then:That which is real is not real, but seems to be.Or:That which objectively exists, does not objectively exist, butdoes seem to objectively exist.From which we can conclude, that unless you want to get acontradiction, that no things objectively exist.But I have a problem with this because I would like to saythat *I* objectively exist, if nothing else. Cogito Ergo Sumand all that.Perhaps you do not mean all that, but rather mean:""Objective Reality is Unreachable by humans.""Which is not so bad, and so far as I know is true.Have on. If reality is an illusion, isn't True Reality an illusiontoo? And if True Reality is spirit, doens't that make Spirit an Illusionas well?If I am not distinctly confused, this is getting positively Buddhist.That is one hell of a statement, although perhaps true.Do you mean to imply that it was *intended* to be so? If so,please show that this is true. If not, please explain how thiscan give a purpose to anything.How does it do that?Wouldn't the world=school w/ intent idea make the world a preparation forsome *greater* purpose, rather than a purpose in itself.What pressure?It is not necessary to be a success in human terms, unless yourgoals either include doing so or require doing so before theythemselves can be achived.Indeed, many people have set goals for themselves thatdo not include success in human terms as _I_ understand it. Checkout yer Buddhist monk type guy. Out for nirvana, which is notat all the same thing.Why is learning to love a goal? What happens if you fail in thisgoal? To you? To God?

"Contrary to what the ""Protocols of Zion crowd"" might suggest,Judaism does not have any such goals.The question you ask is complicated and deserves an honest answer.I am going to provide one from my own current perspective, not a historicalone.  Currently, as a non-observant jew/Israeli/American, my own feelingis that Jews from the diaspora do not have a greater right in Palestine orIsrael, than the palestinians or Israelis (both arab and jew) do.With regard to Jewish Israelis, they should have the same rightsin Israel as do all other Israelis.Who are them?  If by them you mean the non-religious Jews, I thinkyou should be aware by now that the majority of the settlers and theirsupporters are religious.  The other part of the problem is, to myknowledge, not that the palestinians don't want to be a part of Israel,as much as they would accept (for the most part) being full citizensof Israel, with all the priviliges and responsibilities accorded Israelicitizens.  What they object to is the current limbo in which they findthemselves.",9

If this is correct, I do not find it unreasonableto assume that high doses of MSG can cause other mouth tissues to swell.Also, as the many of the occurances (including two of the above)involved beef, and as beef is frequently tenderized with MSG, this iswhat I suspect as being the cause.I wouldn't be at all surprised if toxicity studies of MSG in animalsshowed it as being harmless, as it would be very startling to hear a labrat or rhesus monkey complain about their throats feeling funny.Anyone who wishes to explain how the majority of food additives aretotally harmless is welcome to e-mail me with the results of any studiedthey know of.

"The gravity maneuvering that was used was to exploit 'fuzzy regions'.  Theseare described by the inventor as exploiting the second-order perturbations in athree body system.  The probe was launched into this region for theearth-moon-sun system, where the perturbations affected it in such a way as toallow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slowdown. The idea is that 'natural objects sometimes get captured withoutexpending fuel, we'll just find the trajectory that makes it possible"". Theoriginator of the technique said that NASA wasn't interested, but that Japanwas because their probe was small and couldn't hold a lot of fuel fordeceleration.

LOGICAL PROOFS OF JESUS CHRIST'S RESURRECTION            1.  Jesus's enemies *would not* have stolen His                body because that would have perpetrated the                resurrection--the very opposite of what they                desired.            2.  Jesus' disciples *could not* have stolen His                body because Pontius Pilate established guards                to stand watch over the tomb lest His body be                stolen.            3.  Sadly (and ironically), many of Jesus' disciples                did not believe in the Resurrection until Jesus                had risen from the dead.            4.  In nearly 20 centuries, no body has ever been                produced to refute Jesus' assertion that He                *would indeed* rise from the dead.",7

"I will clarify my earlier quote.  God's laws were originally written for the Israelites.  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable toall people, not just the Jews.  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom ofHeaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was madeobsolete by Jesus.If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In thefollowing verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds uponthe Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.  If you'll notice, Healso reams into the Pharisees for mucking up the Law with their own contrivedinterpretations.  They knew every letter of the Law and followed it with theirheads but not their hearts.  That is why He points out that our righteousnessmust surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdomof Heaven.  People such as the Pharisees are those who really go out of theirway to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin.They had become legalistic, rule-makers - religious lawyers who practiced theletter of the Law but never really believed in it.  I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot ofmodern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believein it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?Christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one'sperspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will.Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is theirchoice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.God be with you,",11
"John 12:24-26: ""Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheatfalls onto the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, itproduces much grain.  ""He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life inthis world will keep it for eternal life.  ""If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there Myservant will be also.  If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor.""Why would I want an eternal life if I hate this one?If we were created by a deity, why would that deity not wish us toenjoy what he has given us?Why would I want to live forever?  The challenge in my life is that Iwill die, and that I must give my life the meaning I wish it to havebefore that happens.  My time is here and will someday pass; I will becontent to live on in the memories of my friends, and once they tooare dead, then I will no longer have any reason to exist.In short: even if your deity *does* exist, that doesn't automaticallymean that I would worship it.  I am content to live my own life, andfend for myself, so when I die, I can be proud of the fact that nomatter where I end up, it will be because of *my* actions and *my* choices.If your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this, then so beit.  I would much rather just cease to exist.  But if your god wantsmy respect and my obedience, then it had better earn these; and if itdoes, then they will be very strong and true.Jesus wasn't the only one who rose from the dead -- I think it wasOsiris who did the same, as well as a few characters from Greek orNorse legend, if memory serves.But still: WHY would I want to rise from the dead?  Why do *you* want to?If your god wants to win my devotion, then it knows what it can do --provide some way for me to believe without having to resort to blindfaith that could be applied equally well to any religion.That's precisely it.  I neither see nor know Zeus either, nor Odin.Shall I offer them the same devotion I offer Jesus?You've got to understand my point-of-view: I see Christians spoutingBible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell thatwill level all opposition.  Truth is, it's not.  Robert has neverdemonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply; hejust rattles them off day by day.  Some brazenly fly in the face ofcommon sense and reality, and I point these out where I can.But even more than that, even when Christians *do* try to explain theverses in their own words, they do so from a Christian point of view,which is that every human being would want to be a Christian if onlyhe or she understood the Christian message properly, and then allstrife and suffering on the earth would end.  Here's the problem withthat: substitute ""Moslem"" or ""Buddhist"" or ""Satanist"" instead of""Christian"", and it means the same thing.Christanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book.  But ifyou want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the REAL WORLD,you've got some convincing to do.And in my opinion, you're bumbling about blindly making up entitieswhere there aren't any, and depriving yourself of a true understandingand enjoyment of your life.  As long as you keep your beliefs toyourself, I'll keep my beliefs to myself -- but as soon as you startwaving them around, expect me to toss in my opinions, too.",11
"Can someone cite Biblical references to homosexuality being immoral, otherthan Leviticus? So far, when I ask, around here, I get the verses fromLeviticus spouted at me, but the whole rest of that book tends to beignored by Christians (haven't seen any stonings in a _long_ time :-).Later,Max (Bob) Muir[The list was posted not long ago, as I recall, aside from Lev, commonlycited passages are:the story of Sodom.  Note however that this was a homosexual rape, andthere's no disagreement that that is wrong.  I take an intermediateposition on this: note that Sodom is referred to elsewhere in theBible for its sinfulness.  It doesn't seem to have been knownspecifically for homosexuality.  Rather, I think it was considered acesspool of all sins. However from what we know of Jewish attitudes,homosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the actiondescribed.  (It almost seems to have been contrived to combine aboutas many forms of evil in one act as possible: homosexual rape ofguests, who were actually angels.)  But this story is not specificallyabout homosexuality.In the NT, the clear references are all from Paul's letters.  In Rom1, there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil.Note that the passage isn't about homosexuality -- it's aboutidolatry.  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment, or atleast result, of idolatry.  There are a number of arguments over thispassage.  It does not use the word ""homosexuality"", and it is referringto people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality.So it's not what I'd call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality.But it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway,that Paul shares the general negative Jewish attitude towards homosexuality.The other passages occur in lists of sins, in I Cor 6:9, and I Tim1:10.  Unfortunately it's not entirely clear what the words used heremean.  There have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning,such as ""wanton"", and that another may be specifically ""maleprostitute"".  Again, we don't have here a precise teaching abouthomosexuality, but it is at least weak supportive evidence that Paulshared the OT's negative judgement on homosexuality.Jude 1:7 is sometimes cited, however it's probably not relevant.  Thecontext in Jude involves angels.  Since those who were almost raped inSodom were angels, it seems likely that ""strange flesh"" refers tointercourse with angels.As you can see, the NT evidence is such that people's conclusion isdetermined by their approach to the Bible.  Conservatives note thatthe passages from Paul's letters imply that he accepted the OTprohibition.  This is enough for them to regard it as having NTendorsement.  Liberals note that there's no specific teaching, and noclear definition of what is being prohibited or why (is the concern inRom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship?  what exactlydo the words in the lists of sins mean?).  Thus some believe it islegitimate to regard this as a attitude Paul took with him from hisbackground and not a specific teaching of the Gospel.This is an explosive topic, which tends to result in longdissertations on the exact meaning of various Greek words.  But it'sclear to me that that's mostly irrelevant.  What it really comes downto is whether people are looking to the Bible for law or whether theybelieve that such as approach is inconsistent with the Gospel.  Thisappears to depend upon one's reaction to the message of the Bible as awhole, as well as one's perception of the needs of the church today.This is a difference of approach at least as serious as the differencebetween Protestant and Catholic in the 16th Cent, and one where bothsides believe that the Bible is so obviously on their side that theykeep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and theother side will finally come to their senses.  That makes thingsvery frustrating for a moderator, who realizes that such an optimisticoutcome is not very likely...",7

There are still quite a lot of people who feel thatthe command economies of eastern Europe failed due to corruption rather thanessential weaknesses of caommand economies,  and you still have a majorityin this nation that favors keeping unenforced and unenforcible laws onthe books in order to ""send a signal"".:It would seem that a society with a ""failed"" government would be an ideal:setting for libertarian ideals to be implemented.  Now why do you suppose:that never seems to occur?...I fail to see why you should feel this way in the first place.  Constantcombat isn't particularly conducive to intellectual theorizing.  Also,they tend to get invaded before they can come to anything like a stablesociety anyway. :I wouldn't call it ""vague.""  I'd call it elastic.  All ""regulation"" is :not necessarily the same.  By opposing all government regulation, some :libertarians treat every system from a command economy to those that:regulate relatively free markets as identical.  That's one reason:many of the rest of us find their analysis to be simplistic. Umm, is there any distinction between ""vague"" and ""elastic"" in thiscontext aside from one having a more positive connotation than the other?At any rate,  we've been through all this before.:Steve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM   :""One thing about data, it sure does cut|  UUCP:    ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh: the bulls**t."" - R.

I respond.     The question that was raised was not if Jesus went to infernal Paradise     before entering into heaven. No one has made a point for or against      that issue, nor have they compared the LDS position against orthodox     belief. The infernal paradise is held to be Abraham's bosom (Luke 16),      the place of the righteous dead in sheol (equivalent to hades).     The point that was raised by John was that someone could not repent     on their death bed. Tom Albrecht pointed to a Biblical example that was     contradictory to what John's position put forward. The thief on the      cross was promised by Christ to be with Him in Paradise, the abode of      the righteous dead. John's position possibly needs to be reworked.

"No.  That's *not* what I was complaining about, nor did I intend tosuggest that DEC was any better than SGI (let me tell you about theLynx some day, but be prepared with a large sedative if you do...).

"By Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch StaffAt 9:11 Thursday night, the scoreboard watchers at The Arena began to cheer.Their cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute tothe playoff-bound Blues.The scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3.With the North Stars' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and thefinal playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quitplaying.They held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appearedwith 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleepand barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.Tampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiatingsupervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that theshot had gone into the net after time had expired.``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end,"" Blues coach Bob Berry said.If the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues'disappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and makingthe playoffs tempered Berry's anger.``It wasn't pretty at the end,"" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, asgood as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, butit did.""Still, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end.Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil thisseason, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawksin a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday atChicago Stadium.The Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points,their fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three pointsbehind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay,which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended itsfirst season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyousBlues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.``It's a shame we let down,"" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to scoretwo goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would haveended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.""Instead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.``We won, and that's all that matters,"" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3for the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.""Some players didn't have a problem.``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit,"" said RichSutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. Youcan't allow five goals like we did, that's not right.``It was disappointing to see what was going on.""Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow,he missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss.``I didn't know it was final,"" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on thebench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs,and that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at theend.""The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboardoperators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The scoreshowed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the thirdperiod. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,""Berry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took.""If Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win mightbother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.Until the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowdgoing at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then,Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period.With the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, dekeddefenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with therebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.Then, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonskiafter defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.Bassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the rebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game ofthe season and reminded him of a special friend.Last year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare formof cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,"" Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, andI know he was watching. I know he's happy.""Miller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zomboat 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 secondslater, making it 5-1.Less than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Berglandscored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a passfrom Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.Then, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the thirdperiod, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goalsto Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the thirdperiod.The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as thewinner. ``We were in there,"" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.""",2

"Any projectile traveling at or near typical bullet speeds is potentiallylethal.  Even blanks [which have no projectile] can cause death if themuzzle is in close proximity to the victim.  I have heard of rubber orplastic bullets being used effectively during riot situations [where theintent is crowd control, rather than close range self defense]; i've alsoseen reports of deaths caused by them [the British in Northern Ireland]. Use of a firearm for self defense is appropriate and lawful only in thegravest of situations; at that point, i consider deadly [lethal] force to be a proper reaction [and so does the law].   Furthermore, use of less effective [but still potentially lethal] forcehas its own set of problems.  It may well take more applications of theless effective force to stop the incident; this places all parties at somerisk; the victim because the attack has not stopped, and the assailent since the aggregate damage done by the multiple applications may well bemore deadly.",8

"From article <1993Apr17.010256.14372@eafs000.ca.boeing.com>, by ten0772@eafs000.ca.boeing.com (Timothy E. Neto):This all sounds suspiciously like my company might have something todo with this.Background first: Megatek has a series of framebuffers designed asX accelerators. For the most part these are designed for Sun SBUSand Sun (and other vendor's) VME systems.That said, Megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-displayon a sigle workstation. Most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse portwhich can be used to provide additional displays. For example, sayyou hade a Sparcstation with an Sbus expansion chassis. You couldput in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system.You could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you tomix and match any combination of screens and displays. You couldhave 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays,or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. Basically anycombination.Because of this, we at Megatek try to be very careful about the useof the words multi-screen and multi-display. They are quite differentin meaning, and (at least in X) have exact definitions.The reason I ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12screens in a display. As it so happens, there's a define in the serverthat determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h,MAXSCREENS). As released my MIT, this is 3. As released by Megatek,this is 12.As such, the most screens supported by a single Megatek display (i.e.X server) is 12. If someone construed this to be a limitation of XI'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by Mr. Neto) this isnot the case.We just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. Ofcourse, I could say ""Buy all you want, we'll support more.""--",15

Only change the tactics.For instance, here are how some penalties should be changed.Dealing Coke -- DeathDealing Heroin -- DeathDealing Pot -- DeathDealing Crack -- DeathThe list goes on and on!!!......JUST KIDDING!!!However, on a more serious note, I do believe that we should take some money away from the foriegn operations in South America and costly border interdiction efforts.

Sounds good so far from what I heard with a decrease in cost, lower addiction rates by wiping out the dealer's markets, etc. (But that was the only thing I have heard about it.)However, legalizing it and just sticking some drugs in gas stations to be bought like cigarettes is just plain silly.  Plus, I have never heard of a recommended dosage for drugs like crack, ecstasy, chrystal meth and LSD.The 60 Minute Report said it worked with ""cocaine"" cigarettes, pot and heroin.",10

"Here's a rough sketch of how the system works.  A reference stationwith a very exactly known position computes the errors in theincoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factorsincluding atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) timedithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational equipment to ""back out"" the errors in its position (since it knowswhere it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a broadcast which is available to any number of relatively localreceivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are usingthe same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be verysimilar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, thereceiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the referenceunit.The US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a seriesof coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations willuse existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signalson different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offerscorrection signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast systemwhich has stations all across the US.The correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format.Advertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.-------------------------------------------------------------------------John P.

We Catholicsdo believe that God's revealed truth that is not explicitly recorded inthe Bible can be and is passed on through the Tradition of the Church.It should be noted that the Tradition of the Church, otherwise known asSacred Tradition, is not the same as ordinary human traditions.However, we do not believe that additional truth will be revealed tothe Church.  Public revelation, which is the basis of Catholic doctrine,ended with the death of St. John, the last Apostle.  Nothing new canbe added.  Theologians study this revelation and can draw out implicationsthat were not recognized previously, so that the Council of Nicea coulddefine statements about the theology of the Trinity and the Incarnationthat were not explicitly stated in the Bible and had been disputedbefore the council, but there was no new revelation at Nicea or atany subsequent council.Cardinal Newman's _An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine_,written while he was still an Anglican, is an excellent discussion ofof this point.

It gets dangerouslyclose to an unfalsifiable view of the history and methodology of science ifwe deny that no subsequent reports of experimenters are reliable descriptionsof their ""real"" reasons.But my point is that this type of case is *not* a rarity.  In fact, I wasgoing to point to Pasteur as yet another rather common example -- particularlythe studies on spontaneous generation and fermentation.  I will readilyconcede that ""ridiculous reasons"" can play an important role in howscientists spend their time.  But one should not confuse motivation withmethodology nor suppose that ridiculous reasons provide the impetus in themajority of cases based on relatively infrequent anecdotal evidence.",5
"{early PA?}# I recall reading of a phonograph which used mechanical amplification.# Compressed air was squirted out of a valve which was controlled by the# pickup.  The result was noisy and distinctly lo-fi, but much louder# than a conventional phonograph.  It tended to wear the disks out# pretty quickly though.An now-deceased prof told us willing students about a project he hadworked on during WWII.They needed a mega-power PA with very clear audio quality. The purposewas to bellow at refugees from aircraft.Their solution was a giant compressed-air source, and a horn withparallel shutters worked by a small audio system. I think he said itworked very well, thus the War Dept. cancelled the project ;_}.",4

"I have 19 (2 MB worth!) uuencode'd GIF images contain charts outliningone of the many alternative Space Station designs being considered inCrystal City.  Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and canbe reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail atmholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.Mark proposed this design, which he calls ""Geode"" (""rough on theoutside, but a gem on the inside"") or the ""ET Strongback withintegrated hab modules and centrifuge.""  As you can see from filegeodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of muchof the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  Thewhite track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station RemonteManipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)pod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrustingcan occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the massproperties of the Station change during assembly.The inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily becauseit can approach closer to the Station's CG and at a structurally strongpart of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces arelimited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of thedocking system.The ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additionallaunch mass.  We've always had the ability to put an ET into orbit(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we've neverhad a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventualde-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent theresidual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit fromimpact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy aKevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminatingthe local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providingfurther micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,it supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as thenucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.The white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control MomentGyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be usedfor gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit systemwhich can be used at the end of the Station's life to perform acontrolled de-orbit (so we don't kill any more kangaroos, like wedid with Skylab).The centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could beused for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravityon humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage devicefor the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted onone of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.This design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,data and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF workdone to date.Mark proposed this design at Joe Shea's committee in Crystal City,and he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumorsI hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiterseems more likely.Please note that this text is my interpretation of Mark's design;you should see his notes in the GIF files.

Wisconsin - In a referendum up against all odds, the determinedefforts of the Madison Area Citizens Against Crime paid off on April6 when a nonbinding referendum banning the possession of handguns inMadison, Wisconsin, was defeated.  Despite opposition to the ban --aired largely by firearms owners at a series of public meetings onthe issue -- the Common Council voted on February 17 to place thereferendum on the ballot, allowing only seven weeks of campaigning toreverse public opinion on the controversial issue. An October 1992 poll conducted by the Wisconsin State Journal found57% in support and 38% opposed, with 5% expressing no opinion.  Byelection day, of the more than 56,000 voters who went to the polls,51% cast ballots in opposition to the proposal while 49% voted tohave the Madison Common Council enact such a ban.  The campaigncommittee, spearheaded by the Wisconsin Pro-Gun Movement and NRA-ILA,relied on neighborhood canvassing, direct mail and radio/TVadvertising to educate voters on the civil liberties implicationsraised by enforcement of the ban if the referendum was approved. Despite the surprising defeat, it is expected that the Madisoninitiative's chief proponent, Mayor Paul Soglin, will attempt to havethe Common Council enact an ordinance banning handguns.

"I don't claim to be an expert on the branch Davidians, but I might know more than most.The Branch Davidian group (led by Koresh) is actually one of two off-shoots of a group known as the Shephard's Rod.  The Shephard's Rod (now defunct as far as I know)broke off from the SDA Church in the 30's.The Shephard's Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the SDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy.  They felt that they were the remnant spoken about in Revelation.About the Koresh group, Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988.  Once in control, he made himself the center of it. He proclaimed himself as Christ.Koresh himself came from an SDA background. He was excommunicated as a young adult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over the youth in the church.  After this, he joined the Branch Davidians.They were/are a survivalist cult. This is why they had the stockpile of weapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc.  They had no intent of raiding the US government or anything. They were preparing for Armaggedon and were putting themselves in a self defense position.

"Archive-name: ripem/faqLast-update: Sun, 7 Mar 93 21:00:00 -0500ABOUT THIS POSTING------------------This is a (still rather rough) listing of likely questions andinformation about RIPEM, a program for public key mail encryption.  It(this FAQ, not RIPEM) was written and will be maintained by MarcVanHeyningen, <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>.  It will be posted to avariety of newsgroups on a monthly basis; follow-up discussion specificto RIPEM is redirected to the group alt.security.ripem.This month, I have reformatted this posting in an attempt to complywith the standards for HyperText FAQ formatting to allow easymanipulation of this document over the World Wide Web.  Let me knowwhat you think.DISCLAIMER----------Nothing in this FAQ should be considered legal advice, or anythingother than one person's opinion.  If you want real legal advice, talkto a real lawyer.QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS---------------------1)  What is RIPEM? RIPEM is a program which performs Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) using the cryptographic techniques of RSA and DES.  It allows your electronic mail to have the properties of authentication (i.e. who sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can read it except the intended recipient.) RIPEM was written primarily by Mark Riordan <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>. Most of the code is in the public domain, except for the RSA routines, which are a library called RSAREF licensed from RSA Data Security Inc.2)  How can I get RIPEM? RIPEM contains the library of cryptographic routines RSAREF, which is considered munitions and thus is export-restricted from distribution to people who are not citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. or Canada.  Therefore, the following request is quoted from the README file: #Please do not export the cryptographic code in this distribution #outside of the USA or Canada.  This is a personal request from me, #the author of RIPEM, and a condition of your use of RIPEM. Note that RSAREF is not in the public domain, and a license for it is included with the distribution.  You should read it before using RIPEM. The best way to get it is to ask a friend for a copy, since this will reduce the load on those sites that do carry it (not to mention the humans that run them.)  Naturally this requires that you trust the friend. RIPEM is available via anonymous FTP to citizens and permanent residents in the U.S. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the README file for info.  Last I looked, this site contains only the source tree, and does not contain compiled binaries or the nice Mac version. RIPEM, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its ""home site"" on rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous FTP for users in the U.S. and Canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  To find out how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and read the file GETTING_ACCESS.  For convenience, binaries for many architectures are available here in addition to the full source tree.3)  Will RIPEM run on my machine? Probably.  It has already been ported to MS-DOS and most flavors of Unix (SunOS, NeXT, Linux, AIX, ULTRIX, Solaris, etc.)  Ports to Macintosh include a standard UNIX-style port and a rather nice Mac-like port written by Raymond Lau, author of StuffIt.  More ports are expected, and help of users is invited.4)  Will RIPEM work with my mailer? Probably.  How easy and clean the effective interface is will depend on the sophistication and modularity of the mailer, though.  The users guide, included with the distribution, discusses ways to use RIPEM with many popular mailers, including Berkeley, mush, Elm, and MH. Code is also included in elisp to allow easy use of RIPEM inside GNU Emacs. If you make a new interface for RIPEM or create an improvement on one in the distribution which you believe is convenient to use, secure, and may be useful to others, feel free to post it to alt.security.ripem.5)  What is RSA? RSA is a crypto system which is asymmetric, or public-key.  This means that there are two different, related keys: one to encrypt and one to decrypt.  Because one cannot (reasonably) be derived from the other, you may publish your encryption, or public key widely and keep your decryption, or private key to yourself.  Anyone can use your public key to encrypt a message, but only you hold the private key needed to decrypt it.  (Note that the ""message"" sent with RSA is normally just the DES key to the real message. (See ""What is DES?"") Note that the above only provides for privacy.  For authentication, the fingerprint of the message (See ""What is a fingerprint, like MD5?"") is encrypted with the sender's private key.  The recipient can use the sender's public key to decrypt it and confirm that the message must have come from the sender. RSA was named for the three men (Rivest, Shamir and Adleman) who invented it.  To find out more about RSA, ftp to rsa.com and look in pub/faq/ or look in sci.crypt.6)  What is DES? DES is the Data Encryption Standard, a widely used symmetric, or secret-key, crypto system.  Unlike RSA, DES uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages.  However, DES is much faster than RSA. RIPEM uses both DES and RSA; it generates a random key and encrypts your mail with DES using that key.  It then encrypts that key with the recipient's public RSA key and includes the result in the letter, allowing the recipient to recover the DES key. DES is sometimes considered weak because it is somewhat old and uses a key length considered too short by modern standards.  However, it should be reasonably safe against an opponent smaller than a large corporation or government agency.  It is not unlikely that future RIPEMs will strengthen the symmetric cipher, possibly by using multiple encryption with DES.7)  What is PEM, and how does RIPEM relate? PEM is Privacy Enhanced Mail, a system for allowing easy transfer of encrypted electronic mail.  It is described in RFCs 1421-1424; these documents have been approved and obsolete the old RFCs 1113-1115. RIPEM is not really a complete implementation of PEM, because PEM specifies certificates for authenticating keys, which RIPEM does not handle at this time.  Their addition is planned.8)  What's this about distributing and authenticating keys? For a remote user to be able to send secure mail to you, she must know your public key.  For you to be able to confirm that the message received came from her, you must know her public key.  It is important that this information be accurate; if a ""bad guy"" convinces her that his key is in fact yours, she will send messages which he can read. RIPEM allows for three methods of key management: a central server, the distributed finger servers, and a flat file.  All three are described in the RIPEM users guide which is part of the distribution. None of them provide perfect security.9)  Why do all RIPEM public keys look very similar? RIPEM public keys begin with a PKCS identifier describing various characteristics about the key, so the first bunch of characters in your key may be the same as those of lots of other people's keys. This does not mean your keys are similar, but only that they are the same class of key, were generated with the same program, are of the same length, etc.10)  What is a fingerprint, like MD5? MD5 is a message digest algorithm produced by RSA Data Security Inc. It provides a 128-bit fingerprint, or cryptographically secure hash, of the plaintext.  It is cryptographically secure because it is not possible (in a reasonable amount of computation) to produce a different plaintext which produces the same fingerprint.  Thus, instead of signing the entire message with the sender's private key, only the MD5 of the message needs to be signed for authentication. MD5 is sometimes used for other purposes; for example, it is often used to map an input of arbitrary length to 128 bits of data, as a passphrase interpreter or cookie generator. MD5 is described in its entirety (including an implementation in C) in RFC 1321.11)  What is PGP? PGP is another cryptographic mail program called Pretty Good Privacy. PGP has been around longer than RIPEM, and works somewhat differently. PGP is not compatible with RIPEM in any way, though PGP does also use RSA. Some major differences between PGP and RIPEM: - PGP has more key management features, particularly for users without   a direct network connection. - RIPEM conforms to the PEM RFCs and thus has a greater probability of   working with other PEM software.  PGP makes no attempt to be compatible   with anything other than PGP (in fact, PGP 1.0 is not compatible with   PGP 2.0.) - RIPEM uses RSAREF, a library of RSA routines from RSA Data Security   Inc.  RSAREF comes with a license which allows noncommercial use.   PGP uses its own implementation of RSA which is not licensed; thus,   PKP, the firm holding the U.S. patents on the RSA algorithm, claims   that it is a infringement of that patent to make, use or sell PGP in   the U.S. or Canada.  In acknowledgement of this, PGP's original   author, Phil Zimmermann, says in the documentation:   #In fact, if you live in the USA, and you are not a Federal agency,    #you shouldn't actually run PGP on your computer, because Public   #Key Partners wants to forbid you from running my software.  PGP is   #contraband.   - Both PGP and RIPEM are export-restricted, and cannot be sent outside   the U.S. and Canada.  However, PGP already exists on many ftp sites   in Europe and other places. Whether you use PGP or RIPEM or whatever, the documentation to PGP is recommended reading to anyone interested in such issues. Note that the above facts, both regarding patent and export restrictions, are somewhat controversial; many people think it shouldn't be that way, and some people interpret various documents differently.  Unfortunately, discussions of it on the net inevitably seem to produce more heat than light, and probably belong in misc.legal.computing.  (See:  ""DISCLAIMER"")12)  What about RPEM? RPEM stands for Rabin Privacy Enhanced Mail.  It was similar to RIPEM, but used a public-key cipher invented by Rabin (which is not RSA) in an attempt to avoid the patent on RSA.  It was written by Mark Riordan, the same author as RIPEM. Its distribution was halted when, contrary to the beliefs of many (including Rabin), Public Key Partners (PKP) claimed that their patent was broad enough to cover any public-key cipher whose strength rested in the difficulty of factoring products of large primes, not just RSA. This claim is not universally accepted by any means, but was not challenged for pragmatic reasons. RPEM is not really used anymore.  It is not compatible with RIPEM or PGP.13)  What is MIME? MIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and is described in RFC 1341.  You can find out about it in the newsgroup comp.mail.mime.  How PEM should interact with MIME is not yet entirely clear; some people use the stopgap solution of having a MIME type application/x-ripem in order to send RIPEM messages as MIME ones.  I hope some standards will emerge.  Draft Internet documents exist on the matter.14)  I have this simple way to defeat the security of RIPEM...",3

"We will be holding a bake and craft sale at Communiversity in Princeton on  Nassau Street, Saturday April 24th 12-4 p.m. to benefit the Recurrent  Respiratory Papillomatosis Foundation, a nonprofit foundation established to  encourage research toward a cure for Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.  Our  three year old daughter suffers from this disease.  Below is a press release  that appeared in local newspapers.  Hope you can join us.On Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family  will be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public  awareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.Bill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease  characterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and  trachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would  lead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.   Three year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis  last year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her  lifetime.  Even though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives  of enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory  Papillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide  support for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a  newsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid  in the prevention, cure, and treatment.Since medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to  those viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money  were available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant  attention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP  Foundation's mission is to change that. Anyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call  Marlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.  Monetary donations can be made at the  Foundation's booth during Communiversity, April 24th, 12 to 4 p.m., in downtown  Princeton, or sent directly to:",5
"Hi Damon,  No matter what system or explanation of creation you wishto accept, you always have to start with one of two premises, creationfrom nothing, or creation from something.

"Tony-I read your post, it was nothing new, I had seen much the same in othertypical""Christian"" anti-gay sentimental literature.  Gay people are and willcon- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates.  You maybe unaware of all the statistica ""findings"" concerning African-Americans thathave been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own biasagainst African-Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances,but there are many other groups.  Of course, the vast majority of the publicscoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case.Fortunately African-Americans had ""whites"" who supported their 'cause' andpublic sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around.  There waseven a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased.  In fact, until lawswere put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was prettymuch legal to discriminate against them.I know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be freeform discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something,that is your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)openly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society,including gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creationand making disciples.  We believe in the Lord's great commandment to Love,and we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popularto do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find achurch almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believesin the commandment of Love (though I'm hard-pressed to find many who actuallysho Love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especiallywithin their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christiancommunity for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionistsagainst the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed andtreated as runaway slaves for being ""nigger-lovers"" and such.  I guess I'vedecided the challenge is worth it.In my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragicstory centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straightwho have been hurt in the process, etc.  Funny thing is, I don't know of onecase where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to rejecttheir gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after theybegan to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.I'm apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0raged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition ValuesCoalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garnersupport within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for moreoppressive legisation against gays.Perhaps you don't get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn't get it in theMiddle Ages and the proclaimed God's will be done as they massacred thousandsin witch hunts and inquisitions.The message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gayrights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, evenhatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn't changethe results).  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, thefinal effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a""conditional"" love for gays.  Condition:  Change and we'll love you. This issure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an ""unconditional""love, one that calls people ""just as they are.""  Sure there are things thatwill 'naturally' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) thatneed to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are thingslike left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, isgoing to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to ""otherpeople's expectations."" In the process this coerced conformity causes manypeople a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who havenothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about theirown sense of pseuper-spirituality.This is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may beunpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do withsomething very personal like 'sexuality' (a taboo subject even today), but Ifirmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulationon thier bedrooms.  It's funny that most straight people have successfullyremoved restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation,but we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though ithelps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society.Gay people are not criminals.Another interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismaticchurch in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it's pastors arrested for self-admitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys).  This had apparentlybeen going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges werevoluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine thatwas how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thinghappen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friendsrecently told me he was ""approached"" by someone who is going through thereparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request fordinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.These are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments andcreating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is notthe call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment inColorado has created an organization who's posters are appearing all overColorado called ""S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T."" (I forget the whole definition off hand,but the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash) and their mottois ""Working for a fag-free America"" with an implicit advocation for violence.This is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others areembracing.We Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppressiontowards those we feel don't 'measure up', and constant beratement fromorganizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a goodpurpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways ofexcluding people.The Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to ""include""people.  I have several of Dr. Martin's books and find them quite helpful,especially concerning 'cults.' But it seems that CRI, has become a cult untoitself.  Why don't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring peopleto Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away?Whatever",11

"I was having a look through a couple of components catalogues when Icame across a range of Peltier Effect heat pumps intended for coolingcomponents.  For those who have not heard of this effect, you put acurrent through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one sideto the other.  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  Ithink a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.Anyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box forpicnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and acouple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with anefficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten mycar battery in about half an hour).Unfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basicspecs as a heat pump.  I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as thetemperature gradient across the device increases.  If so, presumablyits power decreases as the back-EMF increases, until eventually wehave a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming noleakage).  If so, then the final temperature difference between thetwo sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more(although that would be a lousy way to control it).What I would like to know is:1: Are the above guesses correct?2: What is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device?   (I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm   too fast when I unplug it)3: How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work?

"The difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees.Lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice is reallywhy we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurancein Canada (along with France and Germany) without HMO's --- the NYThas admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitudelower in Canada but doctors take-home pay is almost equal to Americandoctors; also, minimal bureaucracy 'cos the system is so-o-o simple(early March).Part of the deal for using the all-insurance approach like the Frenchand Germans do (hey, why don't they criticize France and Germany?  Isit because too many people take French and German in college to makethe accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance.Since the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat whenthe fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctorswere just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strengthrather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socializedmedicine approaches like Britain's National Health Service.For non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover whycertain procedures are in scarcer demand.  I have MD friends who can'tmake a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurancerates but because they won't get enough customers -- the CMA medicalmonopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so theymust move to larger places.  However, this does not refute debunkingof waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in theU.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. DennisE. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.Doug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada'shealth insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is onesmall error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.Of course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germanycase, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the publicsector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extrainsurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. wardaccomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personalbenefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to becovered for basic care.At that point, they wouldn't even consider a ""voucher"" approachto broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make upthe difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.It is ""free"" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (twothings which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more likereal health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that whenworking in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was payingfor health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on mypay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but onlyannually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscalnaifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the Canadian Left forthat is part of their brainwashing agenda.The French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine's Summer 1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurancecoverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100%afterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a privatehospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospitalrate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the samecash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paidout-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.Over 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So,the other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, notgleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public andprivate expenditures for total outlay using the same methods thatyield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.Health insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, itsjust that it doesn't cover basic care.  You can opt out in Canadaand Germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result becausethere are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.When private insurance realized how much money they'd make without therisks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxeamenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set onthe fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to patthemselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebeclast spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned againstany thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province'spublic health insurance plan.gld",10

"{Sorry, Harel et al, but our doctors and most hospitals are stillprivate in Canada as well as in much of Western Europe.}Wrong.  In better EC countries that use pure (but public) healthinsurance (like we use in Canada) rather than self-enclosed HMO-likesocialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementaryinsurance and/or copayments.

The GDP figures are combined public and private expendituresfor total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figurefor the U.S.That the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fundis to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such backin Canada (to make the Canadian insurance look more like real healthinsurance -- which actually it is).  The new Reform Party, a breakoffof traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly ""libertarian""faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but thatjust a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the averageCanadian/European is more fiscally naive than their Americancounterparts on issues like these).I'm one of the few people who favour copayments (forget aboutleftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadiannewsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, 'cos the 100%insurance payment is hidden (unlike in France) and if you didn't knowit, you'd believe it actually is socialized medicine (Americanconservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones whoseriously call it that).  Canadians aren't worried about theAmericans, who spend 14%; we're worried about the French and Germanswho spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things thatshouldn't be paid for out of general funds like physicals forinsurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc.  The reason thatthe Canadian health insurance hasn't spiralled out of control despitebeing open and universal is that unlike Americans, there is no urge tospend all of your benefits' worth, and more if you can ... we're adifferent culture.""Managed Care"" relies on HMO's, which are unknown in most westernnations that use only public health insurance like Canada, Franceand Germany (I'm Canadian, and my German father-in-law-to-be saysof HMO/NHS approaches, ""We left that behind with East Germany!"").Sure, HMO/NHS controls costs because you have managers stranglingdoctors with budget strings.In Canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in Franceand Germany, with all private doctors and both private and publichospitals.  It is all pure insurance without HMO's.  The divisionsare different, with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked""sickness funds"" over a century old while Canada divides by theirprovinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with thedoctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.)With such an open-ended system, it's no surprise that Canada is #2 tothe U.S. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go. TheFrench and Germans use the same approach but have larger populationsin more compact geography to improve scales of economy.gld",10
": (lots of stuff about the Nicene Creed deleted which can be read in the  original basenote.  I will also leave it up to other LDS netters to  take Mr. Weiss to task on using Mormon Doctrine to declare the difinitive  word on what the LDS Church teaches as doctrine.  Hopefully the LDS   netters will be amiable in their explanation.)Since it would do no good to rebut what Mr. Weiss has stated on the originof the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspired (I say ""no good""because it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not the authors of the Creed were inspired), I leave you (it will be some time before I post again) with the following thought authored by Eugene England, Professor of English at Brigham Young University.  Mr. England wrote the following as part of a book review section in This People's magazine (Spring 1993 edition):  ""I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--  or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other   with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian   or non-Christian -- Hal 8^).  When we are tempted to draw a circle around  a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude  those who don't fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central  defining characteristic of a good American might be ""one who doesn't draw  exclusive circles"" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the   central American ideal is by excluding others.  And when we are tempted to  draw a circle around ""Mormon"" or ""Christian,"" to decide who is ""orthodox""  and who isn't by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider  that the central pillar of Christ's ""orthodoxy"" is our ability to love  unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.  ""I recently spent some time in a ""Christian"" bookstore in California. The  service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and  well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural  commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons.  But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking   others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American  culture, or other religions.  A whole section was devoted to ""Cults and the  Occult,"" and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same  rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism.  And I found  I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers  (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous  anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations  of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s).  ""It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to  Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety (""Perfect  love casteth out fear,"" I John 4:18).  I have always been pleased that the  LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though I find a   disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the  same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive  action---as the ""religious right wing"" has launched this year against the  political left and American cultural and religious styles they don't like.  It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the  very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would,  if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons' rights along with those of  others they believe to be evil.""The above ""sermon"" was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribeto This People's magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us whorely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into Hisarms.  Even though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles of the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ, the Church does not claim perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do now lead the Church.  I, for one, do not wish to be labelled ""Christian"", if those who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are intollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication than mainstream Christianity would give it.  Once again, being in the majority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective voice is louder.  That's really all the critics of the LDS Church have to standon in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter the LDS Church' interpretation!  Using someone elses biased research of truths and non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to disprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone, least of all themselves. Let us simply agree to disagree, and share beliefs through adult discussion and conversation, thereby uplifting everyone.",11

That is, hole   particles only exist in the presence of matter.   Previous threads have stated that holes only exist in certain   semi-conductors. The question that naturally arises is if   the hole currents inside a semi-conductor vanish at the point   where the semiconductor is joined to a conductor (say, copper).   I don't want a theoretical discussion here about whether   holes could exist inside metal conductors, rather I ask for   an experimental discussion on how to amplify and detect such   currents *if* they exist.

If you have corrections or answers to other frequently askedquestions that you would like included in this posting, send email toleech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).    If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' toyour KILL file for this group (if you're not reading this with a newsreaderthat can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck).    The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed downby rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available inthe Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.    Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. Thepoint of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing oldanswers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressingthan rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are providedbecause they give more complete information than any short generalization.    Questions fall into three basic types:    1) Where do I find some information about space?    Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask    for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There    are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended    discussion.    2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?    Hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been    thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for    evaluation.

Not only do you have to change the speed from 600 to 300 rpm(tried that) but also change 8 components in the Rec/Play section to allowfor the lower data rate (250kbit, not 500kbit as it was designed for) and alsochange the Recording Current to allow for the low data rate/rev speed!Hopefully this should sort it all out .... not bad for 9 quid (normally 32 quid and upwards ....)The drive is a JVC MDP series drive ...",4

"From: andersom@spot.Colorado.EDU (Marc Anderson)	>Also.. how about a box that you plug your phone into, which would allow	>encrypted voice communications with someone who has a similar box?  	>(digitizing input speech, transmitting, and decrypting on the other end).  I 	>don't know how a public-key system could work in this regard, but it might 	[...]	heh heh... I posted this just before reading all the Clinton Chip messages..	I guess they beat me to it..  Anyway, I think it would be a great idea to	develop such a product, perhaps in the underground, as it would otherwise	probably become illegal pretty quickly here...It's really very feasible and shouldn't be too expensive - all that's neededis a box with a phone jack on one side, a DSP in the middle to do codecfunctions of speech->compressed bytestream, and an RS232 on the other side.You'd plug your phone into it, plug the RS232 into your computer, and havea good old fashioned normal modem on your other RS232 port.  The CPU in themiddle would do the encryption with a version of pgp modified to work ona byte stream.With v32bis or better modems to carry the bytestream, it should work. Quality would only be marginally lower than a normal telephone.At the very highest price, you could use one of those voice-mail compatiblemodems to do the digitisation - that puts an upper bound of about $500 onthe cost of such a box.  In practice, you really ought to be able to getthe price well below $100 - I could do it now in software on my cheap&nastyhome RISC box (Acorn Archimedes) with the digitising microphone I boughtfor 25 pounds, if I knew how to write good speech compression software(which I don't).The reason it won't work of course is that hardly anyone will have one -the only consumer equipment to have encryption will use the wiretap chip.Economics, I'm afraid.However... we can get about 2Kcps throughput on the internet even withthe bottleneck of a v32bis modem.  When we get ISDN for all (ha ha ha)and the new NREN, it might then be trivial to run compressed speechover a tcp/ip connection on the Internet.  Perhaps we should startthinking now of a standard to keep voice on the internet compatiblefor everyone, and side-step the clipper stuff and use internet forall our phone calls in future :-)  [1/2 joking]",3
"I write:  and a(You'vehardwareThethesetsameprogramsprogramsforgethaving After comparing the above strings with my AT commands reference guide, Icame up with:ATZ0L2N2X5&D0S11=50^MThis is entered in the 'Initialize' box on the 'Modem Preferences' in Zterm.Quick summary of each commmand:Z0	- Reset modem to User Profile 0.L2	- Speaker volume at 2 (fairly quiet)N2	- Ring volume at 2 (fairly quiet)X5	- Display connect info according to setting 5 (see manual)&D0	- Assume DTR (computer) is always onS11=50	- Dial speed at 50 (as fast as ZyXEL can handle)In FirstClass, I used this same string, with the addition of S0=0 rightbefore the S11 command, in the setup box.  This disables the auto-answer function of the modem for FirstClass.  I based my modem setting on the Supra14.4FAX, and just changed the above mentioned string.In Telefinder, I based my setting on the Zoom V42 - HH setting.  I changedthe 'Modem Initialization' string to the same one I used for FirstClass, andeverything seems to work fine.Sorry it took so long to get this summary out.  If someone wants to forwardthis to the /info-mac/reports directory at sumex-aim, it might save othernewbie ZyXEL users like myself the trouble of setting up their strings, andalso save the net some redundant messages.

"I bought a 386DX33 system a little over 2 years ago, and was satisfied witheverything about Zeos.  That computer went off to grad school with my son andI replaced it with a 486DX2/66 pkg 4 (345 MBHD, 16MB ram) with Diamond Viper,128K level 2 cache, and tower upgrades, delete the CTX monitor.  I got a17"" HP D1193A monitor employee purchase.  This is a *great* system, fast,quiet, solidly built, not a single glitch bringing it up.  Tech support seems busier now than 2 years ago.  I called with a configuration question, andthey called back 4 hours later with the right answer.  I think there's aslight premium over Gateway prices, but IMHO Zeos is worth it. BTW they have enough 800 lines that I've never gotten a busy signal calling sales,customer service, or tech support. Now, you usually wait 5 or 10 minutes totalk to someone, but at least you get in the queue and wait on their dime.",13

"[a lot of stuff deleted]:      For that matter, stay Biblical and call it Omar Rasheet (The Feast of: First Fruits).  Torah commands that this be observed on the day following: the Sabbath of Passover week.  (Sunday by any other name in modern: parlance.)  Why is there so much objection to observing the Resurrection: on the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured?  Why jump it all: over the calendar the way Easter does?  Why not just go with the Sunday: following Passover the way the Bible has it?  Why seek after unbiblical: methods?:  In fact, that is the reason Easter ""jumps all over the calendar""- Passsoveritself is a lunar holiday, not a solar one, and thus falls over a widepossible span of times.  The few times that Easter does not fall during orafter Passover are because Easter is further linked to the Vernal Equinox-the beginning of spring.[more deletions]:  :       So what does this question have to do with Easter (the whore: goddess)?  I am all for celebrating the Resurrection.  Just keep that: whore out of the discussion.:  Your obsession with the term ""whore"" clouds your argument.  ""Whore"" isa value judgement, not a descriptive term.[more deletions]Overall, this argument is an illustration of the ""etymological fallacy""(see J.P. Louw: _Semantics of NT Greek_).  That is the idea that the truemeaning of a word lies in its origins and linguistic form.  In fact, ourown experience demonstrates that the meaning of a word is bound up withhow it is _used_, not where it came from.  Very few modern people wouldmake any connection whatsoever between ""Easter"" and ""Ishtar.""  If DanielSeagard does, then for him it has that meaning.  But that is a highlyidiosyncratic ""meaning,"" and not one that needs much refutation.",7

"I've had, and still have a few aluminum sticks.  I got my first when I was 15(a Christian), and broke the shaft halfway through the season, two years later.  I bought another (a Canadian) at the beginning of the next season, and I still have it.  I also have an Easton, that a friend was getting rid off, after giving up the game.  I find that Easton blades are easier to get, but all brands of blades are pretty well interchangeable.  Watch out for dried up bits of firewood, that some stores pass off as blades.  In my experiences, the blades of an aluminum break more often than regular sticks, but I've only ever broken one aluminum shaft.I like aluminum sticks.  The blades are quickly changed, even on the bench if you have to.  On the downside, the shaft won't break if you decide to impale yourself on it :-)Ciao,Mark S.",2

"It's not a bad question: I don't have any refs that list this algorithmeither. But thinking about it a bit, it shouldn't be too hard.1) Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well asthe circle that they lie on (you say you have this algorithm already)2) Find the center  of this circle. The line passing through this centerperpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center ofthe sphere.3) Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. Thisgives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere'sorigin. Their interection is the center of the sphere.4) the radius is easy to compute, it's just the distance from the center toany of the original points.I'll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-)An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formedby the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains thecenter of the sphere.

But, this is using a system designed for the 030. So, It stands to reason that a system designed for an 040 ie quadra) would do better. So overall I'd figure 040 = 030 * 2.5 or so.    Along the same lines the new POwerPC stuff is supposed to run the system at the level of a fast quadra, but system 8 or whatever will allow 3 times the speed of a 040 in the powerPC based systems. and wait for the 680060.

Box 605	Amherst, NY 14226-0605    COMPUTING CRATER DIAMETERS FROM EARTH-IMPACTING ASTEROIDS    Astrogeologist Gene Shoemaker proposes the following formula, based on    studies of cratering caused by nuclear tests.		     (1/3.4)    D = S  S  c  K  W	    : crater diameter in km	 g  p  f  n	       (1/6)    S = (g /g )		    : gravity correction factor for bodies other than     g	  e  t		      Earth, where g = 9.8 m/s^2 and g	is the surface					    e		      t			      gravity of the target body. This scaling is			      cited for lunar craters and may hold true for			      other bodies.		(1/3.4)    S = (p / p )	    : correction factor for target density p  ,     p	  a   t							    t			      p  = 1.8 g/cm^3 for alluvium at the Jangle U			       a			      crater site, p = 2.6 g/cm^3 for average			      rock on the continental shields.    C			    : crater collapse factor, 1 for craters <= 3 km			      in diameter, 1.3 for larger craters (on Earth).							    (1/3.4)    K			    : .074 km / (kT TNT equivalent)     n			      empirically determined from the Jangle U			      nuclear test crater.	      3		   2		       19    W = pi * d	* delta * V  / (12 * 4.185 * 10  )			    : projectile kinetic energy in kT TNT equivalent			      given diameter d, velocity v, and projectile			      density delta in CGS units. delta of around 3			      g/cm^3 is fairly good for an asteroid.    An RMS velocity of V = 20 km/sec may be used for Earth-crossing    asteroids.    Under these assumptions, the body which created the Barringer Meteor    Crater in Arizona (1.13 km diameter) would have been about 40 meters in    diameter.    More generally, one can use (after Gehrels, 1985):    Asteroid	    Number of objects  Impact probability  Impact energy    diameter (km)		       (impacts/year)	   (* 5*10^20 ergs)     10			    10		     10^-8		10^9      1			 1 000		     10^-6		10^6      0.1	       100 000		     10^-4		10^3    assuming simple scaling laws.

The latter was written with    simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind    (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).    More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John    Snyder's USGS publication ""Map Projections--A Working Manual"", USGS    Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32    projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both    spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It's a    neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one's $20.    You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,    ""An Album of Map Projections"", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This    contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are    in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.    You can order these 2 ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from USGS:    Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey, 507 National    Center, Reston, VA 22092. (800)-USA-MAPS.

"There is no known writing directly attributable to Menachem Beginwhich admits a massacre at Deir Yassin.  Thus, Hasan is wrong.The word ""troops"" is unjustified.  There has never been any evidencethat there were any regular or irregular Arab forces in the villageapart from the villagers defending themselves.  According to theHaganah observer Pa'il, the Irgun/Lehi forces suffered a lot ofcasualties because they were incompetent soldiers.  When they raninto trouble securing the central part of the village, a small group of Palmach soldiers came and took it without a single casualty.Begin's failure to even mention the Palmach is only one of themajor inaccuracies (to use a kind word) in his account.Incidentally, ""three times as heavy"" may be correct, as there isserious evidence that the Arab loss was closer to 120 lives thanto the oft-quoted 250 lives.  However, note that Begin compareswounded Jews to dead Arabs.  He fails to mention the number ofwounded Arabs.  Guess why.As is thoroughly established by many sources, the loudspeaker truckgot stuck in a ditch too far from the village for it to provide ausueful warning.It is worth noting how Begin disputes the standard myth that thePalestinian Arabs fled as part of a calculated plan.Apparently 90% of Israeli historians are Jew-haters.I have previously posted quotations by Irgun participants thattotally destroys Begin's whitewash.

"What are the main advantages of this method?  I have seen it described, andthe algiorithm seems a  little bit long.  I developed my own method, whichrequires that the points be in a counter-clockwise order, and returnswhether you are looking at the back or the front, similar to the plane eqnmethod.  It uses few calculations however, basically it is severalcomparisons.  The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after thetransformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on thescreen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand.  Mymethod basically figures out whether the points that will appear on thescreen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  When looking at the back ofsomething, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, somerely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you arelooking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.

"This is a difficult problem for which there is no obviously goodsolution.  One approach is simply to try and move political opinionand hope a new more libertarian consensus lasts for a while.  Anotherapproach is to try and amend the constitution.  The originalconstitution restrained the U.S. government from economic interventionfor 100 to 150 years, depending on just how one wants to count it.The First Amendment, though weakened in many ways, still restrainsgovernment (particularly state and local), even though on manyparticular issues the majority is in favor of censorship.  I thinklibertarians would be happy with another 100 years of restraint viaan amendment or two (not that I think that's likely to happen).Not necessarily Mr. Hendricks, but other posters seem to see this asa problem with libertarianism, that it cannot be stable.  That mightbe true, but it is not an objection to libertarianism per se.  Ifa libertarian political consensus forms for a decade or two and thenfalls apart again, we would just be back where we are now.  This isunlike the case for socialism where a socialist consensus that heldfor a while and then fell apart would not leave us where we are now,but instead with lots of bureaucracy that would be hard to get rid of,if not tyranny as the end condition of a strong socialist consensus.",10

"Are most players who come up young always good when they're young, orlater?Damn.

ButAlomar *is* a fine defensive catcher, which was my statement above.That is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age, as longas they feel he can also hit a bit.  Lopez does not have such aconsensus about his defensive prowess, and imho that is enough togive him that dreaded ""seasoning"".Sorry.  New.  Don't know Nichols' Law.  Don't believe in catchers'era.  But I am interested in pitchers' eras with different catchers.Any info on that?In other words, we know more than they do, so the only logic behind a different decision than we would make must be financial.

Baseballis a business, and if there is a solid business reason for keepingLopez on the farm then that's what the Braves *should* do.I happen to believe that it's a baseball decision.  While you fromyour armchair may disagee, I don't.  I think there is a lot ofevidence to suggest the decision they made.  I predicted it amonglarge guffaws from several at the start of spring training.  Ithink it is a very *normal* decision to have made.  It is certainlymore reversible than to have started Lopez in the bigs and havereleased one of their catchers.  Sure, it may be conservative.  Itmay also be logical.

"[...]   In the September 1992 issue of THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY DIET AND NUTRITION   LETTER, there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners.  What   follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.   [Reproduced without permission]	   The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,	where a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under	the tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,	presumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if	a person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group	of 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and	sugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after	drinking the artificially sweetened beverage.	   The study received widespread media attention and stirred a	good deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public.	However, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers	did not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did	actually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not	necessarily go hand in hand.	   In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining	the effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.	And after reviewing every one of them, the director of the	Laboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins	University, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-	sweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in	the amount of food eaten afterward.	   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing	cancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a	host of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government	has received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing	everything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.	Still, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and	after the sweetener's entering the market have failed to confirm	that it can bring about adverse health effects.  That's why the	Centers for Disease Control (the government agency charged with	monitoring public health), the American Medical Association's	Council on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration	have given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a	clean bill of health.	   Granted, the FDA has set forth an ""acceptable daily intake"" of	50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed	the limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take	in 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of	aspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,	or 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...	A 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams	of the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups	of yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content	of selected foods omitted]	   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away	from aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called	phenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000	to 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential	amino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child	consumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause	such severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with	PKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other	aspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning ""Phenylketonurics:	Contains Phenylalanine.""",5

"Reply-To: pwhite@empros.com  Here in America people tend to think of choosing a church much like theythink of choosing a car or a country club. What I mean is that our culture is such that we tend towards satisfying our own wants ratherthan considering things with others in mind and not making prayer an initial and primary part of the decision process. People tend totreat church as they would a club and when something is less than totheir liking, off they go to another one.I think that scripture presents the idea that God takes a different perspective on the ""church choosing process"". It seems to me from 1Cor 12that God doesn't subscribe to the idea of us choosing a church at allbut that he places us in the body as he wants us. So, I think a betterquestion is not how do I choose a church but how do I figure out whereGod is trying to place me.If a person was instrumental in leading you to Christ, the church theygo to is a logical first choice. You have been born into the family ofGod. People should hop around from church to church as often as theyhop from natural family to family.If you met the Lord on your own (so to speak) there may not be an easily identifiable church to try for starters. Here you are morelike an orphan. Prayerfully go and ""leave yourself on a few doorsteps""and see if anyplace feels like home. I wouldn't expect that God want to place you in a church where youhave difficulty fitting in with the people, but on the other handthere are no perfect churches. If you have an attitude of lookingfor problems you will both find them and make them. On the other handif you have an attitude of love and committment, you will spread thatwherever you go. In general, I think that God will try to place you in a church thattalks about the Lord in the way that you have come to know him and isexpanding on that base.",7

"(reference line trimmed)Well, I'd say that a murderer is one who intentionally committed a murder.For instance, if you put a bullet into a gun that was thought to containblanks, and someone was killed with such a gun, the person who actuallyperformed the action isn't the murderer (but I guess this is actually madeclear in the below definition).What do you mean by ""reasonable?""[...]Yes, it is bad to include the word being defined in the definition.  But,even though the series is recursively infinite, I think the meaning canstill be deduced.[math lesson deleted]Okay, let's look at this situation:  suppose there is a longstandingfeud between two families which claim that the other committed sometravesty in the distant past.  Each time a member of the one familykills a member of the other, the other family thinks that it is justifiedin killing a that member of the first family.  Now, let's suppose that thissequence has occurred an infinite number of times.  Or, if you don'tlike dealing with infinities, suppose that one member of the familygoes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing.  That is, thereis a never-ending loop of slayings based on some non-existent travesty.How do you resolve this?Well, they are all murders.Now, I suppose that this isn't totally applicable to your ""problem,"" butit still is possible to reduce an uninduced system.And, in any case, the nested ""murderer"" in the definition of murdercannot be infintely recursive, given the finite existence of humanity.And, a murder cannot be committed without a killing involved.  So, thefirst person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarilya murderer.  Is this enough of an induction to solve the apparentlyunreducable definition?

"Tough question -- more dangerous than driving a car, and far moredangerous if you don't apply a modicum of intelligence to the activity.  Basically, stupidity will get you hurt/killed a lotfaster on a motorcycle than in a car.  But with care, it isnot unreasonably dangerous.  Also, buying good protectiveclothing is helpful, that way if something does go wrong,you are likely to be less severely injured.First thing, if possible take a (MSF) driver training course,this will get you started on the right foot -- they teachcontrol of the vehicle and safe riding practices.Second, buy protective gear.  At minimum a good helmetand a pair of leather gloves are a must.  A good sturdy piece of footgear is also very helpful, though leather hikingboots, a pair of old army boots, or something similar works finefor this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay tied.  After those, a leather jacket and leather pants or chapsare nice as well; but these are also expensive items.  For thepants, many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable,preferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight.  Similarly fora jacket, a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise, thoughmore people tend to have leather jackets around than pants.  Anotherthing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second-handleather jacket.  Look for a fairly thick leather in these items.Third don't do anything stupid -- don't ride after drinking, even one drink can noticeably affect you judgementand balance; don't ride in the snow, or when conditionsare such that black ice is likely; be very careful ridingin the rain -- slow way down, take corners gingerly, brake early and gently;  try not to ride if you are sick,tired, taking any medication with drowsiness warnings, orotherwise not in average shape.With care, you should be ok.I would suggest mid to late 80's japanese mid-sized standard.Something in 400-650 cc range would probably be reasonable.  Ifyou are shorter/lighter than average, you might want to go aslow as a 300-400 cc bike.Possible models: The Suzuki GS### series (eg. GS500, GS650, etc.).  These are generallyinline 4 bikes, generally dependable except for a tendency to weakness in the charging system.  (Stator and/or Regulator/Rectifier problems.)  My first bike was a (about '82) GS650, it server me well.The Honda Nighthawk series (this may also be known as the CB### seriesI think).  eg. Honda CB450, CB650, etc.  This is another series ofstandard motorcycles.  Also fairly dependable.Kawasaki and Yamaha probably have similar bikes, but I don't knowthem as well.For mid to late '80s models of the above, you should be able tobuy the bike for under $2000, leaving you money for protective clothing and insurance and licensing costs.",18

"All your friend really has to do is find a Registered Dietician(RD).  While most work in hospitals and clinics, many major cities will have RD's who are in ""private practice"" so to speak.

If you can get your friend's physician to make a referral, medical insurance should pay for the RD's services just like the services of a physical therapist.  The better medical insurance plans will cover this but even if your friend's plan doesn't, it would be well worth the cost to get on a good diet to control the intestinal discomfort and help the intestinal lining heal.Crohn's disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestinal lining and lipoxygenase inhibitors may help by decreasing leukotriene formation but I'm not aware of tea or turmeric containing lipoxygenase inhibitors.

What is and how can I implement drag and drop?----------------------------------------------------------------------0.  Xt Glossary----------------------------------------------------------------------o The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code  to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with  this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,  RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,  etc.  The terms ""Xt"" and ""Intrinsics"" are used interchangeably,  however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X  window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,  Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the  Intrinsics are not especially useful.o A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The  precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It  is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the  Object class although these are more accurately called windowless  widgets or gadgets.o Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below  the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib  functions because Xt provides most such services although an  understanding of Xlib helps with problems.----------------------------------------------------------------------1.

Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads?----------------------------------------------------------------------In brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion forcritical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one ofthe above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all theappropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of alist traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out thatbehavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler callsany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problemspecific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions otherfunctions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed thatthese functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.The only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in theinterrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by awork procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add eitherof these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerousto add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectivelypreempts any work procedures previously added and so they will neverbe called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loopabout the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handlercan write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal.However, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.Why don't the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because itis supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operatingsystem.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don't think so.        Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'ReillyVolume 6 are in error.----------------------------------------------------------------------4.  How do I use a different visual than the default?----------------------------------------------------------------------This requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window hasthree things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap andborder pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmapresource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questionsdeals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of theseresources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In theshell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreenand DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources isnot properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window iscreated.  They are not properly set because each of the values dependson the visual being used.  How to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  Thefirst is if you want an application to start with a particular visualand the second is if you want a particular shell within an applicationto start with a different visual.  The second is actually easierbecause the basic information you need is available.  The first is alittle harder because you'll need to initialize much of the toolkityourself in order to determine the needed information./* * Some sample code to start up an application using something other * than the default visual. * * To compile: *	cc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm * * To run: *	./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow * * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap * to install. */#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>#include <X11/StringDefs.h>#include <X11/Shell.h>typedef struct{	Visual	*visual;	int	depth;} OptionsRec;OptionsRec	Options;XtResource resources[] ={	{""visual"", ""Visual"", XtRVisual, sizeof (Visual *),	XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, visual), XtRImmediate, NULL},	{""depth"", ""Depth"", XtRInt, sizeof (int),	XtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, depth), XtRImmediate, NULL},};XrmOptionDescRec Desc[] ={	{""-visual"", ""*visual"", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL},	{""-depth"", ""*depth"", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL}};intmain (argc, argv)	int		argc;	char		**argv;{	XtAppContext	app;		/* the application context */	Widget		top;		/* toplevel widget */	Display		*dpy;		/* display */	char		**xargv;	/* saved argument vector */	int		xargc;		/* saved argument count */	Colormap	colormap;	/* created colormap */	XVisualInfo	vinfo;		/* template for find visual */	XVisualInfo	*vinfo_list;	/* returned list of visuals */	int		count;		/* number of matchs (only 1?) */	Arg		args[10];	Cardinal	cnt;	char		*name = ""test"";	char		*class = ""Test"";	/*	 * save the command line arguments	 */	xargc = argc;	xargv = (char **) XtMalloc (argc * sizeof (char *));	bcopy ((char *) argv, (char *) xargv, argc * sizeof (char *));	/*	 * The following creates a _dummy_ toplevel widget so we can	 * retrieve the appropriate visual resource.	 */	cnt = 0;	top = XtAppInitialize (&app, class, Desc, XtNumber (Desc), &argc, argv,			       (String *) NULL, args, cnt);	dpy = XtDisplay (top);	cnt = 0;	XtGetApplicationResources (top, &Options, resources,				   XtNumber (resources),				   args, cnt);	cnt = 0;	if (Options.visual && Options.visual != DefaultVisualOfScreen (XtScreen (top)))	{		XtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNvisual, Options.visual); ++cnt;		/*		 * Now we create an appropriate colormap.

Which visual should an application use?----------------------------------------------------------------------This is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there isno way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has tobe specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then yourapplication probably falls into the category of always using thedefault visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particularvisual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or somesuch).Why?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a serverallocates resources I may not always want your application to run inTrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I maybe very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColoror just monochrome.As an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many differentpossible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, staticcolor, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris's offer all the above plus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.----------------------------------------------------------------------6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual?----------------------------------------------------------------------This is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrarywidget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for theshell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of thatshell.A widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must haveits own realize method to use the visual when it callsXCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can beobtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  Areasonable value is probably XtNvisual.----------------------------------------------------------------------7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit?----------------------------------------------------------------------The default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  Thisis interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen()and the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e.it is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.If the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copiescolormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as thevisual.----------------------------------------------------------------------8.  I've done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why?----------------------------------------------------------------------Some resource converters improperly cache references.  This wasespecially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.----------------------------------------------------------------------9.  Why doesn't my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()?----------------------------------------------------------------------See section 2.8 of the Xt specification.It eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  TheIntrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and allof its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed.It is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way anypending X events or further references to that widget can be cleanedup before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is thenperformed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions havecompleted, before checking for the next X event.  At this point thelist is traversed and each widget's memory is actually free()'d, amongother things.As some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if theIntrinsics determine that they have no further references to thewidgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occursimmediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed onthe destroy list before entering the inner event loop are notdestroyed until returning to the outer event loop.----------------------------------------------------------------------10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks?----------------------------------------------------------------------The problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exitingan application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widgetmay not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as opensockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code forsimplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):	Widget	ToplevelGet (gw)		Widget		gw;		/* widget to find toplevel */	{		Widget		top;		for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))			/* empty */;		return (top);	}	void	ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)		Widget		gw;		/* widget */		XtPointer	closure;	/* data the app specified */		XtPointer	call_data;	/* widget specific data */	{		Widget		toplevel;		toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);		XtUnmapWidget (toplevel);	/* make it disappear quickly */		XtDestroyWidget (toplevel);		exit (0);	}One can see that the above code exit's immediately after destroyingthe toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may neveroccur.  This works for most widgets and most applications but will not workfor those widgets that have any external state.  You might think thatsince it works now it will always work but remember that part of thereason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorantof the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that thewidget may change and someday require that some external state iscleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.One alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag andthen test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, privateevent loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, anddifficult to maintain practices.Try the following code instead.	#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>	extern Widget ToplevelGet (	#if NeedFunctionPrototypes		Widget		gw	#endif	);	extern Boolean ExitWorkProc (	#if NeedFunctionPrototypes		XtPointer	closure	#endif	);	extern void ExitCallback (	#if NeedFunctionPrototypes		Widget		gw,		XtPointer	closure,		XtPointer	call_data	#endif	);	Widget	ToplevelGet (gw)	Widget		gw;		/* widget to find toplevel */	{		Widget		top;		for (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))			/* empty */;		return (top);	}	void	ExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)	Widget		gw;		/* widget */	XtPointer	closure;	/* data the app specified */	XtPointer	call_data;	/* widget specific data */	{		Widget		toplevel;		toplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);		XtUnmapWidget (toplevel);	/* make it disappear quickly */		XtDestroyWidget (toplevel);		XtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw),				  ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL);	}	Boolean	ExitWorkProc (closure)		XtPointer	closure;	{		exit (0);		/*NOTREACHED*/	}ExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when theapplication is next idle -- which happens after all the events areprocessed and the destroy callbacks are executed.----------------------------------------------------------------------11. How do I resize a Shell widget?----------------------------------------------------------------------After it is realized, one doesn't resize a Shell widget.  The properthing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widgetusing XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to theShell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow therequest.  However, the Shell must have the resourceXtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask thewindow manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.To change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, notthe child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.----------------------------------------------------------------------12. Why can't XtAppAddInput() handle files?----------------------------------------------------------------------It does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file doesnot fit most peoples' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a filedescriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would notblock, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not toblock.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  Fora file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF-- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics alwayscalls the input handler because it always thinks something is about tobe read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV basedOS's it is the poll() system call.How to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to useanother process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipeto connect the application with this other process and pass the filedescriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program onBSD systems is ""tail -f filename"".It's rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_reliable.  In particular:	- IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while	  (several thousand times) and then stop until some other	  event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race	  condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.	- Pyramid, doesn't work at all.	- Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as	  sockets), wasn't completely broken, but although the writing	  side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it	  all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at	  a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks	  (get raound it by detecting the situation and having	  select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had	  been given the whole block).Note that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such asread(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area andmay not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designersfelt it was a common enough operation that it should be included withpart of the toolkit.  Why they didn't also deal with signals at thispoint I don't know.----------------------------------------------------------------------13. What good books and magazines are there on Xt?----------------------------------------------------------------------I have a favorite that is the definitive reference.  To my perspectiveit offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the fulldetails of the Intrinsics.  When I started using it I was alreadyfamiliar with Xt and the concepts behind it, so newcomers may or maynot find it useful.  I've always found it accurate and complete, whichmeans its a 1000 pages.Asente, Paul J., and Swick, Ralph R., ""X Window System Toolkit, The	Complete Programmer's Guide and Specification"", Digital Press,	1990, ISBN 1-55558-051-3, order number EY-E757E-DP; and by	Prentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-972191-6. Also available through DEC	Direct at 1-800-DIGITAL.The other book I commonly recomend to novices is:Young, Doug. ""The X Window System: Applications and Programming with	Xt (Motif Version),"" Prentice Hall, 1989 (ISBN 0-13-497074-8).	(ISBN 0-13-972167-3)And of course O'Reilly has an entire series of manuals on X and Xt.O'Reilly ordering is 800-998-9938.  In particular, Volume 5 is an Xtreference done in manual page style.  The 3rd edition is extensivelyoverhauled and goes far beyond the MIT manual pages.  I'm finding itvery useful.  In particular, the permutted index and references toother manual pages help a great deal in chasing down relatedinformation.I read two periodicals, ""The X Resource"" and the ""The X Journal"".These are the only two dealing specifically with X.  ""The X Resource""is published quarterly, by O'Reilly, with one of the issues being theMIT X Consortium Technical Conference Proceedings.  There is noadvertising.  I've found it informative with pretty good depth.  Fororders, call 1-800-998-9938, or email cathyr@ora.com.  For editorialmatters, email adrian@ora.com.  Table of contents are posted atmath.utah.edu in ~ftp/pub/tex/bib in TeX form and on ftp.uu.net in~ftp/published/oreilly/xresource in ASCII form.""The X Journal"" is a bimonthly trade rag with lots of advertising.The articles are informative and oriented toward a less technicalaudience.  I read it more to see what's going on then with anexpectation of learning a great deal (but remember, I represent afairly small percentage of people).  Also, they have a pretty goodcollection of people on the advisory board and as columnists.  Call(908) 563-9033.----------------------------------------------------------------------14. What Widgets are available?----------------------------------------------------------------------There are three popular widget sets:Athena	- The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most	  purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently, a 3d look is	  available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z.Motif	- From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on	  many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but	  Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think	  it is poorly implemented.OLIT	- The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets	  implementing Sun's Open Look specification.  Developed by	  AT&T.  I've never used it so can't comment on its quality.	  I've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.In addition the following collection of widgets are also available:Xtra	- a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software	  Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph, stacked	  bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help,	  spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets.  I've never seen	  them so I can't comment.FWF	- The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of	  freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor,	  FileDialog, and a few others.  The current set of widgets	  can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine	  a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z.Xcu	- The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the	  early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for	  buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so	  widely used.Xs	- The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but	  seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise.Xw	- The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written	  for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5.	  Again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died.	  The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was	  originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided	  much experience for the designers of Xt.Xo	- A widget set I'm working on.  It's still primitive but you	  can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/Xo/*The following specialized widgets are also available:Tbl	- Implements a tabular layout of widgets.  Supports Motif	  widgets as children.  Part of Wcl.Plots	- The Athena Plotting widgets (not the Athena widgets).	  Contact gnb@bby.oz.au or joe@Athena.MIT.EDU.----------------------------------------------------------------------15. What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there?----------------------------------------------------------------------	__________________________________________	Name		Language	Vendor	__________________________________________	Xview		C		Sun	OI		C++		ParcPlace	Interviews	C++		Stanford	Tcl/tk		C		sprite.berkeley.edu	__________________________________________However much I like C and admire the skill in both designing andimplementing the Intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will developin the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language.  Keepyour eyes open and expect some change about the same time a languageother than C _starts_ gaining acceptance.----------------------------------------------------------------------16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues?----------------------------------------------------------------------First, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially)	typdef struct	{		    String	name;	    long	value;	} Arg;and the code:	Arg	arg;	XtSetArg (arg, ""name"", 3.2)expands to	Arg	arg;	arg.name = ""name"";	arg.value = 3.2;you can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.valuegets the integer ""3"" instead of the floating point value ""3.2"".  Whenthe value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern iswildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So,how to get around this?The following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am nowrecomending it over the previous suggestions.#define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \    if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \        XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \    } else { \        XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \        XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \    }----------------------------------------------------------------------17. How do I write a resource converter?----------------------------------------------------------------------Courtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com):The following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5)Intrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allowfor destructors and caching of converted values.There are several main types of resource converters:    string to data type    data type to string    data type to data typei) string to data type    Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings    that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often    used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:	Name		Value	""True""		1	""False""		0    In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare    the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most    readily accomplished by the use of the ""quark"" mechanism of the    resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,    which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a    single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the    quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.    If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many    converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then    a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the    resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of    these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks    and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one    of the converters.ii) data type to string    This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data    type converters since the use of quarks isn't necessary.  Instead,    the data type value is simply converted to a string value,    probably by the use of sprintf.    Data type to string converters are useful for applications that    wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that    they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This    mechanism can be used to provide a ""snapshot"" of application state    into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to    a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.    If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type    converter, it isn't much extra effort to write the data type to    string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure    that they are consistent.iii) data type to data type    This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type    value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be    converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for    red, green and blue.The type signature for a resource converter is as follows:typedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *,	XrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);    Display *dpy;    XrmValuePtr args;    Cardinal *num_args;    XrmValuePtr fromVal;    XrmValuePtr toVal;    XtPointer *converter_data;When the converter is invoked, the ""fromVal"" argument points to the sourceX resource manager value and the ""toVal"" argument points to thedestination X resource manager value.  The ""converter_data"" argumentis an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specifiedwhen the converter is registered.  The ""args"" and ""num_args"" argumentsallow extra information to be passed to the converter when it isinvoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussedabove would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup thePixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.Care must be taken with the ""toVal"" argument.  An XrmValue has thefollowing type definition and specifies a size and location for aconverted value:typedef struct {    unsigned int    size;    caddr_t         addr;} XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;When the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location ofthe given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL.In the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of thedestination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  Ifthe destination area is not large enough, then the converter shouldset the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  Thecaller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke theconverter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simplycopy the converted value into the space given and return True.If the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location tothe address of a static variable containing the converted value andreturn True.When writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and itbecomes convenient to define a macro:    #define DONE(var, type) \      if (toVal->addr) \	{ \	  if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \	    { \	      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \	      return False; \	    } \	  else \	    *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \	} \      else \	toVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \      return True;    #define DONESTR(str) \      if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \	{ \	  toVal->size = sizeof(String); \	  return False; \	} \      else \	toVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \      toVal->size = sizeof(String); \      return True;Inside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safetychecking on the ""num_args"" and ""args"" arguments to ensure that yourconverter is being called properly.Once you have written your converter, you need to register it with theIntrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creatingwidgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.To register a converter with a single application context, useXtAppSetTypeConverter:void XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args,	cache, destructor)    XtAppContext context;    String from;    String to;    XtTypeConverter converter;    XtConvertArgList args;    Cardinal num_args;    XtCacheType cache;    XtDestructor destructor;To register a converter with all application contexts, useXtSetTypeConverter:void XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args,	cache, destructor)    String from;    String to;    XtTypeConverter converter;    XtConvertArgList args;    Cardinal num_args;    XtCacheType cache;    XtDestructor destructor;In the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter andXtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverterand XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should beused.When a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a ""cache"" argumentspecifies how converted resource values are to be cached:    XtCacheNone		Don't cache any converted values    XtCacheAll		Cache all converted values    XtCacheByDisplay	Cache converted values on a per display basisCaching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is agood idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).The ""destructor"" argument is a routine that is invoked then theresource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count hasbeen decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value isbeing destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition:typedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer,	XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);    XtAppContext context;    XrmValuePtr to;    XtPointer converter_data;    XrmValuePtr args;    Cardinal *num_args;The destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associatedwith the ""to"" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointedto by the ""to"" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passedthe extra arguments that were passed to the converter when theconversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual argumentsfor the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need tofree the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the privatedata passed in when the converter was registered.Sample converter code can be found in the following files in the MITR5 distribution:    mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h----------------------------------------------------------------------18. How do I open multiple displays?----------------------------------------------------------------------See ""Multi-user Application Software Using Xt"", The X Resource, Issue 3,(Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issuesinvolved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In anutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_application context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each displayand remove it from the application context.The real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This canhappen 3 ways:	1. User selects a ""quit"" button on one of the displays,	2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message,	3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message,	   server shutdown/crash, or network failure.I'll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ aproblem of translating a Widget to a display and removing thatdisplay.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.The third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on theOliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficultproblem.The difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/Oerror is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially truefor a single display X based application, but not true for amultiple display program or an application that does things other thandisplay information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs theI/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit()happens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoidreturning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragmentdemonstrates this:#include <setjmp.h>jmp_buf XIOrecover;voidXIOHandler (dpy)	Display		*dpy;{	destroyDisplay (dpy);	longjmp (XIOrecover, 1);}main (){	...	if (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0)		XSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler);	XtAppMainLoop (app_context);}The destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can goback to the application specific data and perform any necessarycleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().For those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() isfirst called it returns a 0 and save's enough information in thejmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program tothe same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return valueof this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument tolongjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for thispurpose it is adequate.Some other problems you might run into are resource converters thatimproperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errorssuch as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with thetotal number of displays you can open since typically only a limitednumber of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typicalvalue.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying toconnect to a display.There was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic inNovember of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basicallysaid this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change.----------------------------------------------------------------------19.

Where are the resources loaded from?----------------------------------------------------------------------The resources of a widget are filled in from the following places(from highest priority to lowest priority):	1. Args passed at creation time.	2. Command line arguments.	3. User's per host defaults file	4. User's defaults file.	5. User's per application default file.	6. System wide per application default file.Note that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The resultof steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.The per host defaults file contains customizations for allapplications executing on a specific computer.  This file is eitherspecified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is notset then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.The user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGERproperty on the root window of the display or if that is not set thenthe file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program ""xrdb"" isused to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that thisshould be kept relatively small as each client that connects to thedisplay must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte isreasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGERbut most do not.A user may have many per application default files containingcustomizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quiteflexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describesthe various environment variables and how they effect where this fileis found.The system wide per application default files are typically found in/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then thefallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on howthis file is found.  Read the next part that describes the variousenvironment variables and how they effect where this file is found.[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]You can use several environment variables to control how resources areloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH,XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variablescontrol where Xt looks for application-defaults files as anapplication is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults filefrom the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the pathdefined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.Set XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such away that app-defaults files appear in several different directoryhierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's OpenWindows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this forXFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults filesin both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever yourOPENWINHOME is located):	setenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%NThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list ofpathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows(see XtResolvePathname()):	%N	The value of the filename parameter, or the		application's class name.	%T	The value of the file ""type"".  In this case, the		literal string ""app-defaults""	%C	customization resource (R5 only)	%S	Suffix.  None for app-defaults.	%L	Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. ""ja_JP.EUC"")	%l	Language part of %L  (e.g. ""ja"")	%t	The territory part of the display's language string	%c	The codeset part of the display's language stringLet's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is""Myterm"". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin.(Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)	/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm	$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/MytermAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the aboveapp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, itreads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect ofthis path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.Let's consider another example. This time, let's setXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the currentworking directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.	setenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%NThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expandsto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting fordebugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming theapp-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, soyou can run the application from the directory in which you areworking and still have the resources loaded properly.NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,      for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is      defined so %T and %S are useless.With R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customizationresource value.  For example, you might run the ""myterm"" applicationlike this:	myterm -xrm ""*customization: -color""If one of your pathname specifications had the value""/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C"" then the expanded pathname would be""/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color"" because the %C substitutioncharacter takes on the value of the customization resource.The default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\  (R5)		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\  (R5)		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\     (R5)		/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\		/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\		/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in thisbatch of default settings.)The default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is 		<root>/%L/%N%C:\  (R5)		<root>/%l/%N%C:\  (R5)		<root>/%N%C:\     (R5)		<root>/%L/%N:\		<root>/%l/%N:\		<root>/%N:<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directoryif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to somevalue other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.Notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application findyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to setXAPPLRESDIR to ""."", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery workeddifferently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIRvalue to ""./"", a dot followed by a slash.----------------------------------------------------------------------21. What order are callbacks executed in?----------------------------------------------------------------------(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)The Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is becauseboth the widget writer and the application writer have the ability tomodify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither onecurrently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannotguarantee the order of execution.The application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; thewidget writer is not required to document when the widget will add andremove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have;therefore the functionality contained in a callback should beindependent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on thelist.Even though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback 	""callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the 	procedure is to be appended."" you may not infer from the word ""appended"" that the callback routinesare called in the same order as they have been added to the callbacklist.----------------------------------------------------------------------22. How do I know if a widget is visible?----------------------------------------------------------------------(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)Right, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a ""deficiency""in the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of theprotocol.  (The ""deficiency"" is that the information is available in one way,in this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, inthe second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this sectioncarefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.A VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes fromviewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped;that is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency.Visibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol;see the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.You'll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.As an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an actionroutine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widgetwhich contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see themap_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These aresuggestions.----------------------------------------------------------------------23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()?----------------------------------------------------------------------You can't.----------------------------------------------------------------------24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc?----------------------------------------------------------------------Unfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc()tends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it ishandled something like:	ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type))	if (!ptr)	{		perror (""malloc in xyzzy()"");		exit (1)	}To handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functionsXtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() whichall use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() andrealloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xterror handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.In addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it usesXtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like:	if (!ptr)		ptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type));	else		ptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1));	++count;to be written as:	ptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);Also, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I'vefound the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I'mallocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions soI can fully recover from not enough memory errors.XtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating astructure or copying a string:	  struct abc *xyzzy;	  char	     *ptr;	  char	     *str = ""abcdef"";	  xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc);	/* takes care of type casting */	  ptr = XtNewString (str);A strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow animplementation to provide functions that are not exchangable withmalloc() and free().  I.e. code such as:	 char	      *ptr;	 ptr = XtMalloc (100);	 /* ... */	 free (ptr);may not work.  Personally, I'd call any implementation that did thisbroken and complain to the vendor.A common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a stringwhen they should really be using XmStringFree().----------------------------------------------------------------------25. How to debug an Xt application?----------------------------------------------------------------------First, I'd recomend getting ""purify"" from Pure Software.  This is agreat package for tracing memory problems on Sun's.  It's a bit priceyat $2750 but I'd still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb(contact support@pure.com for more info).	Purify inserts additional checking instructions directly into	the object code produced by existing compilers.  These	instructions check every memory read and write performed by	the program under test and detect several types of access	errors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past	malloc'd bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts	checking logic into all of the code in a program, including	third party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies	system call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory	usage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel	adaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify's nearly	comprehensive memory access checking slows the target program	down typically by a factor of two to five.An alternative package that isn't as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs onmany Unix's and has pretty similar features is ""The SENTINEL DebuggingEnvironment"".  This replaces malloc() and several other C libraryfunctions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.comfor more info)Next, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you'll need to run insynchronous mode, easily accomplished with the ""-sync"" command lineargument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Thenset a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to theoriginal Xlib function being called.  If you don't run in synchronousmode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls toXlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from theserver are asynchronous.Next, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use theundocumented resource ""xtIdentifyWindows"" or the class resource""XtDebug"" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window.For example:    example% xload -xrm '*XtDebug:true' &    example% xwininfo -tree	     <click in new xload window>will give the normal information but the widget name and class of eachwindow is included.  This can help for checking the location and sizeof errant widgets.Next, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want totest the way a widget manages it's children, you can tryexport.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filterbetween any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviourof both.  It's a very clever idea.The most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while theapplication is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as froma pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you'll need togo to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The serverlocks up because the application being debugged has said no one elsecan have access to the keyboard but the application is not stoppedwaiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands.Unfortunately you can't give them because all the input is going toyour application which is stopped.The best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines onyour desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment)on one machine, and running the application on the other, possiblyusing a command sequence like this:	othermachine% xhost +thismachine	thismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0;	thismachine% gdb application	# Your favorite debugger.	or this:	othermachine% xhost +thismachine	thismachine% gdb application	(gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0	(gdb) run ...I believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a methodof dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions torelease any grabs during breakpoints.Debugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills andknowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowingthe internals of a particular widget but not very far withoutunderstanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditionalbreakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a greatdeal.----------------------------------------------------------------------26. Why don't XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work?----------------------------------------------------------------------   I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,   XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when   I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.   I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works   perfect, but in my ""real"" application nothing happens. The introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted thoseroutines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens isthey use a default application context different then the one you mayhave created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a perapplication context basis and you are using two application contexts,you won't get those events.For example:	...	cnt = 0;	toplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class,				   Desc, XtNumber (Desc),				   &argc, argv,				   Fallback, args, cnt);	XtAddTimeOut (...)	XtAddWorkProc (...)	XtAppMainLoop (app)would never invoke the timeout.----------------------------------------------------------------------27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop?----------------------------------------------------------------------(Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)Drag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an``intuitive'' fashion.Motif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook hassupported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable witheach other, and so far as I know, they are not published.I wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible publicprotocol for doing drag 'n drop operations between clients.  Myintention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people tosupport a ""standard"" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they developand contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as longas it is based on Xt).The implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCMconventions, for more details read the code.I have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel thatit works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also, there seem tobe many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motifanyway.The latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp fromnetcom.com, in /pub/rogerr.  A (possibly older) version is alsoavailable on export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib.",15

"Obesssive Compulsive Disorder (not to be confused with Obsessive Compulsive_Personality_ Disorder !) is an acute anxiety disorder characterized byeither obsessions (persistent intrusive thoughts that cause anxiety whennot entertained), or compulsions (repetitive, ritualistic actions thatsimilarly cause intense psychological discomfort when resisted).  OCD is often associated with certain forms of depression.  Examples of obsessive thoughts are repeated impulses to kill a lovedone (though not accompanied by anger), or a religious person having recurrent blasphemous thoughts.  Generally, the individual attempts to ignoreor suppress the intrusive thoughts by engaging in other activities.  The individual realizes that the thoughts originate from the own mind, ratherthan being from an external source.Examples of compulsive actions are constant repetitive hand washing,or other activity that is not realistically related to alleviating asource of the anxiety.In OCD, the obsessions or compulsions are highly distressing to theindividual, take an hour or more per day, and significantly impair theirdaily routine and social relationships.Treatments include psychotherapy, behavioral methods, and sometimescertain anti-depressants which have recently been found effective in alleviatingobsessions and compulsions.The standard diagnostic code for OCD, if you want to look it up in theDSM-III manual of psychiatric diagnosis is 300.30 .						kind regards,",5

My legs however, are muscular, and I have to pinchto get anything, and then I inject at about a 45 degree angle,and itstill hurts.

When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep, wait for it to dry somewhat, or you may get the alcohol in thepuncture, and of course, that doesn't feel good.  A way to preventirratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way todo this is use a little round bandage and put it over the spot.

"I hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesmentof WFAN and WIP(I go to school in Philadelphia, and I listen toboth stations on a consistant basis.)  Now that the fan has MikeLupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the big name guests for interviews, and not just of local importanceHe did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he had Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.    Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent:Morning show:  In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi, and Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morgantihad a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP triesto copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms ofsports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but heinterjects humor and politics into his show.10 AM to 12 Noon:  I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in theirabilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has theadvantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the callerwho is asking about who the local team is going to draftin the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN getbetter interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say thatthey were not interested in interviews with celebrities unlessit was a major story.  I would consider this even because they are two differentstyles of host.12 Noon to 2 PM:  At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to Jody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only beenon for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the abilityto transcend the ""homer"" mentality of the Philadelphia fanbase.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia spelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan.Where else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0score without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning 'guys')I do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnightand I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotatinghosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on either station by a good margin.  If you are in NY andyou can't get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.2PM to 4PM:  This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and Russo(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most dividedin my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining,but they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10to 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD doget great guests and that is the basis for their show, soit is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is theappearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, whichare often hilarious.  4 PM to 7 PM:  MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I likeMike Missanelli but I just can't stomach Steve Fredericks.  I know that SF came from Philly originally, but when hewas at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Phillyhomer now.  I don't listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless thereis a game on that night, but you will see later for the reason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.7 PM to Midnight:  S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makesEli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice oncharges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on mynerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I gonuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show)On FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, MetsJets, or St. John's basketball.  If the game is on thewest coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of courseI think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, butWIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season.(If this is the sports station, why did they lose theIGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.))During the summer, itis all talk on WIP.Overall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, withthe exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.

"I've heard it said that the accounts we have of Christs life andministry in the Gospels were actually written many years after the event.(About 40 years or so). Is this correct??

Luke's prolog isabout the only thing we have from the author describing his process.The prolog sounds like Luke is from the next generation, and had to dosome investigating.  There are traditions passed down verbally thatsay a few things about the composition of the Gospels.  There aredebates about how reliable these traditions are.  They certainly don'thave the status of Scripture, yet scholars tend to take some of themseriously.  One suggests that Mark was based on Peter's sermons, andwas written to preserve them when Peter had died or way about to die.One tradition about Matthew suggests that a collection of Jesus wordsmay have been made earlier than the current Gospels.  In the ancient world, it was much more common to rely on verbaltransmission of information.  I think many people would have preferredto hear about Jesus directly from someone who had known him, and maybeeven from someone who studied directly under such a person, ratherthan from a book.  Thus I suspect that the Gospels are largely from aperiod when these people were beginning to die.  Scholars generally dothink there was some written material earlier, which was probably usedas sources for the existing Gospels.Establishing the dates is a complex and technical business.  I have toconfess that I'm not sure how much reliance I'd put on the methodsused.  But it's common to think that Mark was written first, around 64AD., and that all of the Gospels were written by the end of theCentury.

"As our local.religion.christian BBS group seems moribund, I'm posting here.On one of the Sundays just before Easter I went to church.  The sermon wasbased on a story in the Book of Joshua.

What with having heard that CBC radio documentary andknowing that the Muslims in Bosnia were losing the war, I feltuncomfortable.  After all, the Serbs are driving non-Christians out.

Also, the pastor has talked of spiritualwarfare and of bringing Christ to the nonreligious people of our area.The next Sunday, the sermon was about Joshua 6 (where the Israelitestake Jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there --- exceptfor Rahab, who had sheltered the spies).  With those reports aboutBosnia in my mind, I felt uncomfortable about the minister saying thatthe massacre (the one in Joshua) was right.  But what really botheredme was that, if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously, Ishouldn't be so troubled about the reports of ""ethnic cleansing"" inBosnia.  Certainly, my sympathies shouldn't be with the Moslims.Considering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christianswho, under Turkish rule, converted to Islam could the Serbs be doingGod's work?",7

"->	First I want to start right out and say that I'm a Christian.  It ->makes sense to be one.  Have any of you read Tony Campollo's book- liar, ->lunatic, or the real thing?  (I might be a little off on the title, but he ->writes the book.  Anyway he was part of an effort to destroy Christianity, ->in the process he became a Christian himself.Sounds like you are saying he was a part of some conspiracy.  Just what organization did he belong to? Does it have a name?->	The book says that Jesus was either a liar, or he was crazy ( a ->modern day Koresh) or he was actually who he said he was.Logic alert - artificial trifercation.  The are many other possible explainations.  Could have beenthat he never existed.  There have been some good points made in this group that is not impossible  that JC is an amalgam of a number of different myths, Mithra comes to mind.->	Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as follows.  Who would ->die for a lie?  Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar?  People ->gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing ->someone who was or had been healed.  Call me a fool, but I believe he did ->heal people.  Logic alert -  argument from incredulity.  Just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn'tmean that it isn't true.  Liars can be very pursuasive, just look at Koresh that you yourself site.He has followers that don't think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die.By not giving up after getting shot himself, Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what he believes.  As far as healing goes.  If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is notconsistent between the different gospels.  In one of them the healing that is done is not any more that faith healers can pull off today.  Seems to me that the early gospels weren't that compeling,so the stories got bigger to appeal better.->	Niether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn ->to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example ->anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool, logical people see ->this right away.->	Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the ->real thing.  Or might not have existed, or any number of things.  That is the logical pitfall that those whouse flawed logic like this fall into.  There are bifurcations (or tri, quad, etc) that are valid, becausein the proceeding steps, the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are possible.  Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are, then arguments amongthe alternatives can be presentent, and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excludingall other possible alternatives.However, if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive, then any conclusions bases on the incomplete set are invalid, even if the true choice is one of the original choices.  I have given at least one valid alternative, so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn't one ofthe other two alternative is no longer valid.->	Some other things to note.  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in ->the psalms, Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone.  This in his betrayal ->and Crucifixion.  I don't have my Bible with me at this moment, next time I ->write I will use it.JC was a rabbi.  He knew what those prophecies were.  It wouldn't be any great shakes to makesure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy.  What would be compeling is if therewere a set of clear and explicit prophecies AND JC had absolutely NO knowledge of then,  yet fullfilled them anyway.->	I don't think most people understand what a Christian is.  It ->is certainly not what I see a lot in churches.  Rather I think it ->should be a way of life, and a total sacrafice of everything for God's ->sake.  He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the ->same.  Hey we can't do it, God himself inspires us to turn our lives ->over to him.  That's tuff and most people don't want to do it, to be a ->real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere at.  But ->just like weight lifting or guitar playing, drums, whatever it takes ->time.  We don't rush it in one day, Christianity is your whole life.  ->It is not going to church once a week, or helping poor people once in ->a while.  We box everything into time units.  Such as work at this ->time, sports, Tv, social life.  God is above these boxes and should be ->carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for ->ourselves.  Here I agree with you.  Anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says seriously, and what it says is that it must be a total way of life.  I have very little respect for Xians that don't.  If the myth is true, then it is true in its entirity.

"[DISCLAIMER: Throughout this post, there are statements and questions whichcould easily be interpreted as being sarcastic.  They are not.  I have writtenthis reply in the most even-handed manner that I can, with no emotions boilingto the surface as it was written.  Please accept this as a serious attempt tofoster dialog and rest assurred that I make every attempt to make fun of noone, except myself ;-)][...]	Hmmm.  There are other animals on this planet with advanced	mental facilities which have not developed ""religion"" as a	satisfactory explaination for the unexplained.  Why is this so?	Further, it appears that only humans have a ""need"" to explain the	unexplained.  Why is this so?  The other animals on this planet,	including those with advanced mental facilities, seem perfectly	content in their ignorance.	I'd like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me	from your unsupported statement.  They are: 1) humans are animal	*only*; 2) religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need	not be researched; 3) religion was ""made up"" by humans to address a	perceived need; 4) the biological aspect of humans is deified (that	is, all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical	structure with biology at the apex).	Needless to say, I disagree with your strong opinion #1 and the	underlying presuppositions.	I disagree that Christianity is ""an infectious cult"".  It has	certainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in	spite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.	That it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is	""infectious"" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides	a workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this	is the case).	I disagree that Christianity is ""a safety blanket"" which supplants	hope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one	Source of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a	Christian's source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to	you is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose	and externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of	control over one's own life the problem or is it something else?	Finally, one does not appropriate ""eternal happiness"" by following	Christian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance	of Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people	from their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the	Christian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian	in the Person of God's Spirit.	Heaven is one of two final states that	Christian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally	not motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this	promised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived	benefits to them in the here-and-now.	Many Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a	priority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this	as a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate	priority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,	convert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).	Rather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting	the opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits	of a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful	that it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask	""Why?""  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-	plished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it	does not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian	is required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of	friendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot	evaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or	harm others if the sole purpose of being a ""friend"" is to gain a	conversion).	As a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-	ticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a ""hurry-up""	attitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no	conversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was	coerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open	to it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).	The Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings	conviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part	(witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.	We are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die	just as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more	than this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is	so limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find	a more expansive view.	(For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing	arts that humans do?  How is it that humans can learn the language	of other humans (or animals) but that other animals cannot do so?	How is it that humans can organize themselves in various social	structures whereas other animals have only one structure?)	Blatant assertion.  Christianity is not physically addictive.	Christianity is not psychologically addictive.  Christianity is not	a *thing* which one snorts/ingests/shoots-up; it is a relationship	with a living being.  You might as validly characterize any close-	knit relationship with this appelation.	There are ""Jesus freaks"" who let the emotional aspects of worship	and Christian living gain (and retain) the upper hand.  Even so,	this does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these	things flow.	Guilty by association?  That ""christianity"" which forces itself	upon another is not Christianity at all.	You appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened	2000 years ago.  How did you come by it?	I cannot accept your conclusion that Jesus' influence was a sole	result of the Roman sack of Jerusalem in 70AD.  He was 30+ years	gone by this time.  It strains the bounds of credulity to assert	that nothing about Jesus' life was noteworthy _until_ the sack.	Christianity is having a relationship with Jesus Christ Himself.

"IMHO = in my humble opinion!!I didn't say there was no value - all I said was that it is very confusingto newbies. Bill, you are kidding yourself here. Firstly, motorcycles do not steerthemselves - only the rider can do that. Secondly, it is the adhesion of thetyre on the road, the suspension geometry  and the ground clearance of the motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles, andnot the knowledge of physics between the rider's ears. Are you seriouslysuggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner fasteror more competentlY than you could manage otherwise??Formal training in this country (as far as I am aware) does not includecountersteering theory.  I found out about countersteering about six years ago,from a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist. I didn't believe himat first when he said I steered my bike to the right to make it turn left,but I went out and analysed closely what I was doing, and realized he was right! It's an interesting bit of knowledge, and I've had a lot of fun sincethen telling others about it, who were at first as sceptical as I was. Butthat's all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge, and to claim thatit is essential for all bikers to know it, or that you can corner fasteror better as a result, is absurd.Formal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going tobe able to ride a bike properly and safely. But by including countersteeringtheory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily, right atthe time when there are *far* more important matters for them to learn.And that was my original point.",18

"Buffalo seems to have started a tradition of trading its captains.Pat LaFontaine was awarded the Captaincy when Mike Ramsey was forcedto give it up (Ramsey's now a Penguin).  Ramsey inherited it from MikeFoligno (who's now a leaf).  He in turn had inherited it from LindyRuff, who went I forget where.  Ruff had it from Perreault, whoretired, so I guess that's where the streak started.  Or did it?After all, Danny Gare was captain before him, and he went to Detroit.Jim Scoenfeld, Gerry Meehan, and Floyd Smith are the others, inreverse order, last to first.  I was a bit young at the time, so I'mnot sure of the fate of Schoenfeld, but he ultimately went to Detroitand Boston.  Meehan went to Vancouver, Atlanta and Washington.

"All of the arguments concerning the Sabbath ought to make the pointpretty clear - anyone outside of the Catholic or Orthodox orAnglican orMonophysite churches ourght to worship on Saturday if they are reallysola scriptura.  Otherwise, they are following a law put into effect bythe Church, and only the above Chruches really recognize any power ofthe Chruch to do so.Andy Byler[You will note that nothing in the FAQ said anything about the Churchestablishing or changing a law.  The argument against the Sabbath isthat it is part of the ceremonial law, and like the rest of theceremonial law is not binding on Christians.  This argument is basedon Paul's letters, Acts, and in a more general sense, Jesus'teachings.  Further, most people argue that Scripture shows worshipoccuring on Sunday, and Paul endorsing it.  I understand that thesepoints are disputed, and do not want to go around the dispute one moretime.  The point I'm making here is not that these arguments areright, but that the backing they claim is Scripture.Accepting the principle of ""sola scriptura"" does not commit us toobeying the entire Jewish Law.  Acts 15 and Paul's letters are quiteclear on that.  I think even the SDA's accept it.  The disagreement ison where the Bible would have us place the line.By the way, Protestants do give authority to the church, in mattersthat are not dictated by God.  That's why churches are free todetermine their own liturgies, church polity, etc.  If you accept thatthe Sabbath is not binding on Christians, then the day of worshipfalls into the category of items on which individual Christians or(since worship is by its nature a group activity) churches are free todecide.",7

"The media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday todeath, but I haven't seen anything in rsb yet.Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with twoon and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into theright field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence andwent into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got tothe spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but hemissed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt,reached up and caught the ball.  Home run.Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded thatDarryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentiallybehind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediatevicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered withStrawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fanwho caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was obliviousto where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant assoon as he realized he had made the catch.That exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberrywent into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lotof profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore ofcosting the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurledfood and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadiumofficials started to remove him from the park, but then relented andjust relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game,Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into atirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about winning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who madethe catch.Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speechwherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls thatare hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any that are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he havebeen more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibilityof interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, heis a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocatedhis seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference isimpossible.Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with whatthe fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the firstnine games.I question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pullhitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play,he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilitiesof the fan.--	The Beastmaster",19
"Fine.  Libertarians and anarchists are not alone in being uncomfortablewith the use of state sponsored coercion.  The notion that coercion canbe virtually eliminated in a society (or more properly that once it iseliminated on the part of the state it is no longer worth serious consideration) is a view that is peculiar to libertarians and anarchists.  For example, does ""non-initiated force"" (coercion) include tax collection?Does it include the minimal level of regulation of commerce envisionedby Adam Smith?  Since coercion can be exercised by actors other than thestate, how is the state to deal with it?  Exclusively through after thefact arbitration/legal compulsion?  Well, I must admit that the picture of libertarians as Amway participantsis somewhat more reassuring than the idea of them trying to govern a complex, conflictual, industrial society.  I'd venture to point out, however, that if libertarians couldn't convince at least 85% of a group of ""seminar participants"" to ""embrace"" their philosophy, their propaganda skills need to be honed.  Frankly, however, it is no great trick to create a government for a society in which (almost) everyone is assumed to agree about what is a propergovernment policy.  Once that is assumed, all sorts of annoying formalitiescan be dispensed with, elections, police, etc.  And as Mr. Marx said,the state will just wither away.  On the way there, however, would you like to explain how eliminating virtually all policies that restrain private coercion in the current society will help us to live happier lives?

My father did radioplay by play for the local team, the Trail Smokeaters, who by  the way, werethe last Canadian team to win the World Championship (back in 1961).  I wason skates almost as soon as I could walk, and have been playing recreationalhockey for about 35 years.Lack of ice is a big factor, but costs is a bigger factor.  Both my kids play forthe Santa Clara Valley Hockey Association and this season, which just ended,cost me $75 per kid for membership in Hockey USA, plus $750 per kid for clubdues.  The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance, and the club duescover ice time, officials, trophies, etc.  Other areas have similar fees, unlessthe city government subsidises some of the costs, as Stockton does.By the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the ""inner city""areas.  Eastridge and Vallco are exceptions ... Redwood City's rink is in anindustrial area on Bay Rd, near 101, Berkeley's is near Ashby and Martin LutherKing, Stockton's is in Oak Park, Sacramento's is in an older section of downtown(I forget the name of the street), Fresno's is out on the edge of town, just westof 99.  Santa Rosa's is a nice rink, but it's in an older section of town.Dublin's is outside of town, off 580.  Most of the rinks are old, and expensiveto run, with huge electric bills and insurance premiums.  If you want to buy icetime expect to pay around $100 per hour at any of these rinks.  Some of themgive you a 60 minute hour for your money; others give you a 50 minute hour andinclude the resurfacing time in the fee.",2
"No, there is something called the ""Delany Amendment"" which makes carcinogenicfood additives illegal in any amount.  This was passed by Congress in the1950's, before stuff like mass spectrometry became available, which increaseddetectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitude.This is why things like cyclamates and Red #2 were banned.  They are veryweakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats, so under the Act they arebanned.This also applies to natural carcinogens.  Some of you might remember atime back in the 1960's when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so good,and never tasted so good again.  That was the time when safrole was banned.This is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leaves.If it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days, someonewould do it, in order to make money.  The fact that no one does it indicatesthat enforcement is still in effect.",5

One minute it tells you to kill your kid if he talks back and the nextit says not to kill at all. I think that if xtians really want to follow adeity they should pick one that can be consistent, unlike the last one theyinvented.      For people who say Jesus was the son of god, didn't god say not toEVER put ANYONE else before him? Looks like you did just that. Didn't godsay not to make any symbols or idols? What are crosses then? Don't you thinkthat if you do in fact believe in the bible that you are rather far off track?Was Jesus illiterate? Why didn't he write anything? Anyone know?      I honestly hope that people who believe in the bible understand thatit is just one of the religious texts out there and that it is one of thepoorer quality ones to boot.

First, most of the people I know who activly use encryptionprivately do not care about most of the issues that surround this debate,and any questions about what is or is not ok to use in the US. All theycare about is wether or not what they are using is secure or not. That,after all IS the bottom line. 	Second, if I look at all the people I know who use any formof encryption at all, and this group spans people from the morons whostill insist that the DES is a good and secure standard, to people looking at trying to improve upon existing strategies, I can not thinkof anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leavestheir methods open to abuse. The Clipper does this, because people makemistakes by nature, and the US government is made up of people who arejust as vulnerable to mistakes as everyone else. 	Third, since most of the people I know are at least marginalyfamiliar with the vulnerabilities present in current software encryptionstratigies, I can't see how most of them are going to blindly trust thatsomeone will not figure out a good way to compromise the Clipper Chip.That despite any strengths or weaknesses that may exist in it. So, I can not see a high degree of confidence developing in the chip.	Fourth, when it comes to criminal abuse, sure there are many stupidpeople out there. And yes, some will be open to being caught via the built in back door of the Clipper Chip. However, anyone who is going todo any serious investigation of how best to secure their data is goingto run into that problem pretty damned fast and, I would assume, startlooking around for other easily obtainible methods of encryption. 	If nothing else were avalible, none of this would be an issue. However,the truth is that most private encryption users that I've ever run intosimply do not give a damn about the legal status of RSA or PGP or anythingelse. If it works, they use it. This is not going to change either. I donot think for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will beslowed down by the advent of the Clipper Chip. It is all to easy to convert encrypted data into unintellgible garbage as it is, if anything,the Clipper Chip just adds another tool to the user.	The bottom line here is that people will use what works, andunavoidibly, I'm sure most criminals would rather face an encryptionrelated charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penaltycharges in the case of criminals who murder as part of their conspiricy.	The other thing that has struck me since the advent and wide useage of public encryption has begun is that quite simply the cat isout of the bag (Or if you have an interest in snooping, Pandora's Boxhas been opened), and this is not going to change. I've seen a blindnessto this that I've found utterly stunning, and the Clipper Chip, alongwith the way it has been presented only confirms this to me to a largerdegree.			Sincerly,			Tim Scanlon--",3

"I've just installed a 5.25"" tape backup in my C610; lot of the issuesare the same.  So, to answer your questions...You probably want to hard-wire the SCSI ID with shorting jumpers.  Putit at a convenient number like ""1"".  You *could* cut a hole in theback of the machine to route the ID switch, but why go through thehassle?  You probably won't be needing to frequently change the ID ofyour internal drive.Yeah, when I first installed the tape drive I was a little concernedtoo.  But it's no problem, the device is designed to fit just finewith the overhang.  It shouldn't reach back beyond the ROM/RAM/VRAMSIMMs, though.You can special-order parts to mount the device from your local Appledealer.  The relevant parts are:  922-0358  blank bezel faceplate  922-0850  CD-ROM carrier [i.e., generic 5.25"" device mounting bracket]Note Apple's unfortunate choice of name for the slide-in bracket tomount a 5.25"" device.  The service techs I talked to said, ""Oh sure,we stock those.""  Of course they were thinking of the CD caddies tohold a CD disk when you stick it in the drive.As far as I can tell, Apple does not sell a bezel faceplate alreadycut out for a standard 5.25"" device.  (Why not?  They advertisethese machines as being able to accept any standard device in the5.25"" bay, why not provide the faceplate?)   They do sell a cutout fortheir CD-ROM drive (of course), but that's of no use.I'm going to hack up the extra bezel I ordered to make a cutout for mytape drive, which is a standard 5.25"" device.Good luck with your SyQuest.",14
"The following are my thoughts on a meeting that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lillyhad with an aide of Sen. Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, andcommercial space.  This is how it went...After receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,I called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) PattyMurray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heardthe gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour.Later in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.We got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,who scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were notbozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.Well, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talkingto him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.We covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  Most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was anotherwoman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic thatwe brought up.But, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporatealigned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.So, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access toLEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming feasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.We hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourismpaper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees theatmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smogover L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is more pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to understanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education whereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out thatthey havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to otherfields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.We hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle businessangle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personalcommunicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs providedin those sectors.Jobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..We mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.We left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in orderto make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.We ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts areproceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that theresults from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),and most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts alongthe lines of lowering the cost to LEO.In the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data Purchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it.He asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,and contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actuallyhappen immediatly there.The last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that weknew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that theycould feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't knowthe answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people whoreally did know the answers.Then finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  Hesaid that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, thiswould be something that she would be very interested in, although theydo have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in thestate 1 week out of 6 these days.All in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.",6

"There is another useful method based on Least Sqyares Estimation of the sphere equation parameters.The points (x,y,z) on a spherical surface with radius R and center (a,b,c) can be written as    (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + (z-c)^2 = R^2This equation can be rewritten into the following form:     2ax + 2by + 2cz + R^2 - a^2 - b^2 -c^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2Approximate the left hand part by   F(x,y,z) = p1.x + p2.x + p3.z + p4.1For all datapoints, i.c. 4, determine the 4 parameters p1..p4 which minimise the average error |F(x,y,z) - x^2 - y^2 - z^2|^2.In 'Numerical Recipes in C' can be found algorithms to solve these parameters.The best fitting sphere will have - center (a,b,c) = (p1/2, p2/2, p3/2)- radius R = sqrt(p4 + a.a + b.b + c.c).So, at last, will this solve you sphere estination problem, at least for the most situations I think ?.",1

"If you happen to know a political position which does nothave people advocating it who do more harm than good, please point itout.              One of the advantages and draw-backs of requiring proofon the part of the government before they may take action againstcitizens.  (and part of the reason some of us believe weapons shouldbe available.)       We are not arguing the absolute sanctity of the U.S.Constitution.  In fact, the fillibuster we're talking about isn't*in* the Constitution.  I objected to your suggestion that the Senatewasn't intended to exercise the power it was clearly given.       I'll point out again that Reagan only had a Republican Majorityin the Senate during his first term, and his coalition in the Housecame apart at about the same time.  Bush never had any real support inCongress.       The real point is that everybody, *everywhere* got their pork,from the big corporations to the guy I saw last night leaving aconvenience store with an armful of junk-food he'd bought withfood stamps.  (He spent more in food stamps on junk than I *make* in a weekand I'm not on government assitance.)       Lessee, let's pull out the old Almanac.       In 1980, total U.S. government budget outlays were 590.9 billiondollars.  In 1992 (est) they were 1.4754 trillion dollars, an increase ofapprox. 884 billion dollars.       In 1980, National Defense cost 133.9 billion dollars.  In192 it was 307 billion dollars, and increase of 174 billion dollars.That leaves an increase of 710 billion dollars unaccountedfor.  (This represented an increase of 230%)       In 1980, Income Security (which includes retirement programs,Housing Assitance, and unemployment benefits, and I believe welfare)cost 86.5 billion dollars.  In 1992 it was 198 billion dollars, ormore than national defense started.  (This represented an increaseof 230%)       In 1980, the Federal Government spent 32 billion dollars onMedicare.  In 1992 they spent 118 billion dollars.  (an increase of368%)       In 1980, the Feds spent 9 billion dollars on housingcredits and subsidies of that like.  In 1992 it was 87 billion.       In 1980, Health care services and research was 23 billiondollars.  In 1992, it was 94 billion dollars.       Agriculture, up 9 billion to 17 billion.       Science, up 11 billion to 16 billion.       Resource conservation up 7 billion to 20 billion.       Education up 14 billion to 45 billion.       Veteran benefits up 12 billion to 33 billion.       Trasnportation up 13 billion to 34 billion.            About the only things I see which was seriously decreased was under the Energy category, primarily under ""Supply,"" and ""Community Development,""in the area of ""disaster relief,"" and between the two of themrepresent a loss of less than 11 billion dollars.       Where *was* this huge diversion?       Not that's a stretch.  If the current government was pushed bythe President to create this mess, wouldn't one expect it to begin toequalize once the pressure is gone?       Only assuming that the new role is a positive role we wantto continue. I see very little positive about it.       The Constitution was *designed* to frustrate the democraticprocess, so that the voters could be absolutely sure they were gettingwhat they wanted by the time it happened.  Nor do I see putting thebrakes on the ""democratic process"" an inherently bad thing.  Califronia'sriding the edge and every time they pull their ballot initiative nonsenseit gets worse.       Sometimes, or perhaps most of the time, the people should betold, ""no,"" and pointed to their local government.              Phill, would you do me the very great favor of repeating thatin talk.politics.guns?       Cute.  We can eliminate violations of the law by eliminatingthe law.

The only time I've referredto the Constitution is to point out it doesn't contain the restrictionson the veto and the Senate you appear to believe were ""meant,"" butjust didn't make it in there.

"The FLYERS blew a 3-0 lead over the Buffalo Sabres in the second period, butKevin Dineen's 7th career hat trick powered them to their 7th consecutive win,7-4 over the Sabres who have now lost 7 in a row. Alexander Mogilny led thecomeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at3 in the 2nd period and 4 in the 3rd.

We had to turn down the volume!The FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS havebeen shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in thefirst period. They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sundaywhen they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. Maybe Tommy told them thathe was getting bored back there...Mark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. AfterBuffalo won the faceoff and dumped, Tommy wrapped the puck around the boardsto Eric 1/2 way up on his left. Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it aheadto Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle, passedthe puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him andin on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with hisstick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to theright past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18. It was so beautiful Eric andGarry should turn down their assists :-).The FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strongand kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensivestruggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play whenTerry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk intothe boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and nota terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny gota post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS.Keith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi togive the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the leaguedidn't allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create agood scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towardsthe end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody keptmissing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to givethe Sabres another power play, but they couldn't get anything going and thefans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. Shotswere 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point.Mike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay wasdisappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. This was considereda rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way theseason went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it wasRuss Farwell's trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and EdSnider as far as the money. But yes, there was some agonizing, and they'd doit all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled fornext year he said that it's Russ' call, and Russ will evaluate things at theend of the season. He feels that they're 3 years away from a shot at the Cup.He expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division titlethe following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. This basedon the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.He's very happy with the re-alignment (he called it ""outstanding""). Happy withthe current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unfluxof Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable.Seemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that therewas a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen infour years if there was a consensus.The Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad Maytook a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second. The FLYERS had a little troublegetting started, but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was movingthroug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabresblue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passedacross to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and thetop of the left circle. He half fanned on it, and sent the puck tricklingthrough the slot. Fuhr didn't know where it was, though, and Hawgood won therace to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15.Then Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue lineand went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom wasall over it.The FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them.Viacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking whenBarnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefertook a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22. The Sabres coudln'tget started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into theFLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it andheaded the other way. It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind'Amour hustled ahead tomake it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the topof the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40. That was all for Fuhr, JohnMuckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.But the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time tojust get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were allover them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got throughSoderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone thatmissed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander ashe skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it.Mistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worriedabout A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line rightnext to the net. Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, andmistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at thepuck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. He didn't even swing hisstick out to try and knock the puck away. With the goal, at 7:48, two streaksend for the FLYERS. 150:28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills.Lindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high stickingminor, I think it was Barnaby again. This time the Sabres were able to getset up quickly, but couldn't get too much quality on goal. The Sabres continuedto keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended.Things evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty. McGillallowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before afaceoff. The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out ofhim. But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, andthat meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major,7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15, Barnaby only got 5.The FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so longthey could do that. After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed toLedyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down bySoderstrom. LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side ofthe net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right. Soderstrom hadmoved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were wavingat the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty netat 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2. LaFontaine was actually trying toput it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break.The FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasekwas strong. Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into theneutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERSblue line. Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from theleft circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at18:56 for his 75th of the season. Ironically, the youth hockey tip betweenthe 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting offangles...That was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres.Into the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get theFLYERS the lead back. A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund inthe slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle untilhe had almost no angle at all to shoot from. When he finally did shoot, hehit the far post. That was still during the carryover power play time.Than an incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgooduntouched into Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck underSoderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net. Red light comes on,horn sounds, crowd cheers. But up to the video replay booth, for some strangereason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what theycould be reviewing. Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick bladethat went into the net, not the puck. Emrick mentions that one of the criteriafor scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...Dave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35. The FLYERScould not get anything going at all. They finally got set up 1/2 way through,but were kept on the perimeter. As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puckfrom a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it acrossto Eklund at the top of the left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading at the netjust inside the right circle and passed through to him. Dineen fumbled the pass,but twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncingpuck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS.But the Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensiveleft corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net. Erry started to skateout, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. Mogilny flewin, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstrom's 5 hole for his 76th at5:24 to tie the game at 4.Then Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55. The FLYERS set upin the Sabres zone, and stayed there. Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone inthe middle. While Brind'Amour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through theline and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek's glove side at 6:44.Play started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19.The FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone. Brind'Amour and Ledyard wentafter it, and Rod got the puck. He backed away from the right boards, skatedto the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashingthrough the slot all by himself. Dineen waited patiently and lifted it overthe blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the seasonfor Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35thof the season.Then Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabrespower play. Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of thechances on the FLYERS resulting power play.Play went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had tomake some big saves. The Sabres weren't able to pull Hasek as time was running out as the FLYERS wouldn't allow any consistant possession for the Sabres.Finally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own leftcorner and Brind'Amour stripped it away from him. He pulled away and foundDineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at theright of Hasek. He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Actonchipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48on his 35th birthday. That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo,and the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before thegame.So another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn't been tested muchin his last couple of starts. Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night(unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but I don't think so).The FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 againstwith three shutouts. Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goalsdespite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th placesince the Rangers lose the tie breaker.A couple misc notes:Forget the Mike Keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow toannounce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year.In the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award,but I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman.The Times of Trenton has reported that ""a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma""has looked over Tommy Soderstrom's medical record and determined that nofurther tests are necessary in the near future.Same paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not heexpected to be back next year. His response was that he wants to come back,he feels he did a good job this year, but that he would cheerfully accept arole scouting if Farwell didn't want him back.FLYERS team record watch:Eric Lindros:41 goals, 33 assists, 74 points(rookie records)club record goals:			club record points:Eric Lindros	40 1992-93		Dave Poulin	76 1983-84Brian Propp	34 1979-80		Brian Propp	75 1979-80Ron Flockhart	33 1981-82		Eric Lindros	74 1992-93Dave Poulin	31 1983-84		Ron Flockhart	72 1981-82Bill Barber	30 1972-73		Pelle Eklund	66 1985-86Mark Recchi:52 goals, 69 assists, 121 points.club record goals:			club record points:Reggie Leach	61 1975-76		Mark Recchi	121 1992-93*Tim Kerr	58 1985-86,86-87	Bobby Clarke	119 1975-76Tim Kerr	54 1983-84,84-85	Bobby Clarke	116 1974-75Mark Recchi	52 1992-93		Bill Barber	112 1975-76Rick Macliesh	50 1972-73		Bobby Clarke	104 1972-73Bill Barber	50 1975-76		Rick Macliesh	100 1972-73Reggie Leach	50 1979-80*More than 80 games.FLYERS career years:Player		Points	Best Prior SeasonMark Recchi	121	113 (90-91 Penguins)Rod Brind'Amour	84	77 (91-92 FLYERS)Garry Galley	62	38 (84-85 Kings)Brent Fedyk	59	35 (90-91 Red Wings)That's all for now...",2
"Radius speculated, publicly, that they could provide a PowerPC-basedRocket for existing Macs. It would have the plus of RocketShare andthe minus of NuBus accelerators - no true boot off the accelerator,NuBus bottleneck to video and other I/O.Apple, it seems, will not compete with third parties here -- exceptperhaps for not-yet-available Macs like Cyclone, where a PowerPCslot might be advertised. Look for Daystar and such to make PowerPCaccelerators.One potential problem with any accelerator, though, is that it willneed a ROM companion and Apple has licensed only Radius, withRocketshare, to use any of its proprietary code.Apple is, between the lines, trying to let us know that PowerPC Macswill have simplified logic boards due to the magical nature of RISCand that these boards should be much cheaper to build than those inexisting 68040 Macs. Perhaps, then, we'll see groundbreakingprices in Mac-logic board upgrades, much the same way we've seenmuch cheaper high-performance CPUs this year.First generation PowerPCs, 98601s, will also hopefully have socketedCPUs so that they'll be chip upgradeable to 98604s a year later.This should be possible in much the same way that 486s can be pulledfor clock doublers. If there is too much technical   baggage (whichI doubt since the external busses are the same size/width) to dothis, perhaps we can have CPU daughterboard, a la Powerbook, asstandard to facilitate better CPU upgrades. This is an area whereApple has fallen far behing the Intel-based world. Perhaps catchupis in order.By the way, last week's PC week had an excellent story on PowerPC,Pentium, MIPS R4000, DEC Alpha (the big four on the microprocessorfront for the forseeable future). Worth reading for technojunkies.Also, the latest PC has a cover story on Pentium. Read it, and allthe other stories about how Intel is unstoppable and preeminentright now.Once anyone is this secure, they are due to fall. Intel's marketposition will never again be as dominant as it is today (especiallyif AMD gets the go ahead to sell its 486s this week as it appears itmight). The competition from all fronts is gearing up for an awesomebattle. Apple users should be excited that PowerPC, while notguaranteed dominance, is a guaranteed winner, even if its one ofseveral.",14

"Word 2.0c doesn't show the period-centred character to indicatespaces if I use the TTFonts from CorelDraw.  Our editors need tobe able to see how many spaces are in text but the character displayed is a large hollow box.  They overlap each other andcharacters on each side, which is useless.I believe the character used by W4W is the period-centred (0183).This character shows up with the windows Charmap display as thehollow box which tends to confirm this.  I have edited the corelfont with Fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 0183character makes no difference to the font output in Charmap or W4W.Altering the paragraph (0182) or cedilla (0184) does alter their fontgraphics displayed however!!Is the W4W character used to indicate spaces the period-centredcharacter?

"I've got an 89 GT.  It has the smoked taillight assembly.  I think this is wherethe water is getting in.  When I first got it (had it for a month), one of the reartaillights fogged up with moisture.  I took it in to the dealer and they replacedthe entire assembly.  It happened to the other one about 3 months later.  This timeI happened to look in the spare tire well and noticed water standing in there.  Thedealer was more reluctant this time to replace it.  But I convinced them tofix it.  (They must have had to deal with a number of other probes with the sameproblem.)  I haven't noticed water in the taillamps (or the trunk) for the last 2.5years, but just last month, the taillamp just fogged up again.  I'm going to tryto take it back to get them to fix it again.  I'm real tempted to drill some ventand drain holes in the tops and bottoms of the assembly and forget about it.  This isgetting very annoying.

"I started a similar thread about a month ago, and got many replies.The summary:CTX 14"": Nasty, low quality. Avoid.CTX 15"" Proscan: Not as good as some other makes; however, cheap.  Main problem seems poor quality control. Some reported pincushioning  (the problem I had), others poor focus, etc, etc.I complained about mine and it was 're-tuned' (I dodn't even payshipping) and returned to me in 2 days. It's now clear, well-focussed and has no pincushioning or barreldistortion at all. I'm very happy with it, and the digitalcontrols and mode memory are nice. Certainly, a Trinitron(say) would be much nicer, but that's well out of my price range.Conclusion: If you're on a budget, get one and be prepared tosend it back if it's not perfect.

"The Atari 2600 used a 6502 CPU, just like their entire 8-bit line(400, 800,1200,1400, 1440, 130xe, 65xe computers, as well as the 5200game machine). The 2600 had some extra ASIC chips that were basicallymodified graphics chips and PIA's for the joysticks. Later model 2600might have incorporated many of the chips into one ASCI, as the weightof the machines and part count decreased a lot over the years.Additionally, I think the 2600 used 2K, 4K, and up to 8K of ROM fortheir games. I have no idea how much RAM it had to work with, but Iwould hazard a guess of 2 or 4K RAM. Think comes from a lot of hackingwith the 800 and 130xe computers. And occasionally hacking with the2600 (fixing it for monitor composite video use, and audio hookups).Also I tryed to make a cartridge-less system that stored the ROM intoa RAM cartridge that could be loaded up at some prior time (a way tobackup cartridges). I've heard of a setup like this where games couldbe bought (cheaply) on FSK-recorded tapes, then you would load theminto a special RAM cartidge, and play them.Anyways, if you're interested in looking for 2600 equipment, we've gottwo 2600 machines around (one composite A/V modified), and lotsacartridges.

"[ a lot of religious opinions and quotations from the Bible and from many Catholic theologians and Papal Bulls ][ which, although introduced with a smiley, was not as funny as itmight have been (notable exception: subject headers such as ""ONE'S DICK IS ONE'S INSTRUMENT OF REDEMPTION."" ][ and indeed, the posting seemed to be more a vehicle for thereligious text than for any ""literary/moral analysis"" ]I am surprised and saddened. I would expect this kind of behaviorfrom the Evangelical Born-Again Gospel-Thumping In-Your-Face We're-The-Only-True-Christian Protestants, but I have always thought that Catholics behaved better than this.Friend Dennis, I urge you to follow the example of your fellowCatholics, of who I count many dozens as my friends, and practiceyour faith through good example and decent living and respectfor the common humanity of others. Please do not stoop to thelevel of the E B-A G-T I-Y-F W-T-O-T-C Protestants, who thinkthat the best way to witness is to be strident, intrusive, loud,insulting and overbearingly self-righteous.The imagery in the Song of Solomon is a little bit dated (get it? Middle East - date palms - oh, never mind) but apparently acceptable, on a steaminess level, to be accepted as part of the canon. Fromthis fact I derive that erotica itself is not incompatible withCatholic doctrine.Is there such a thing as Catholic erotica? Not necessarily a lovestory between people of that faith, but a love story that is notexploitative, does not seek redemption through penis size, paysproper respect to the dignity of each partner, and is still eroticenough to have a place on a.s.s.I would submit that the _Darknites_ series of stories qualify, alsomost of the _Journal Entries_, and _Rings I and II_.I would guess that your aim is to cut down on the pornography andincrease the erotica. I actually agree with you that nearly all ofthe ""I've got an enormous dick, and I shot my wad all over her face""stories are crap. I count them as noise, which makes my take on thesignal-to-noise ration much lower than many other people's.Since you are one of the few posters here who can actually write decent prose, could you write a few stories for us instead ofoverwhelming us with commentary?  -- Thank you.",11
"If Clipper comes to cellular phones along with legal proscriptions againstusing other cipher systems on these phones, a new and potentially dangerousclass of crime is created.Criminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications (specificallythe terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow cite as threats)will be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user, andto kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of thedevice will be delayed.Once a suitable collection of devices is stolen, criminals can communicatewith impunity (assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart fromkey escrow) until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means.Because life-is-cheap criminals are currently willing to kill people to stealvery large and conspicuous property (luxury cars), it is reasonable to assumethat they will be willing to kill people to steal small and inconspicuousproperty (a cipher cellular phone).  Just as we have seen in the past with""blue box"" technology, and in the present with modified cellular phones,we can expect to see among high-stakes criminals a lucrative market forstolen cipher phones which can be used for a few days.  The high-stakescriminals will pay the life-is-cheap types substantial amounts for stoleninstruments.Because a person is typically discovered as missing or dead in a few days,a stolen instrument will be usable for only a few days.  There will be acontinuing demand for fresh phones: fresh bodies.In other words, Clipper and similar systems have the potential to turn acurrent inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct, vicious, andpersistent threat to the general public.On the other hand, if a criminal were to apply some arbitrary cipher to adevice in a mostly non-ciphered network, the communication will at leaststand out as being unusual, and perhaps worthy of other means of investigation.Finally, because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting inrealtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments,there will exist strong motivation to record and archive _all_ communicationsin the network for ex-post-facto scrutiny (once some criminal act is discovered,and the instruments involved have been identified).  While recording andarchiving may not be feasible for wireline networks, it is probably feasibleacross the more limited bandwidth of radio networks.  The existence of theserecordings could open up vast potential for abuse.",3

"Punch Imlach's contributions as a coach and GM were far greater thanthose of the above combined.  Should we name a division or trophy afterhim?  Smythe and Norris and the bunch were honoured purely because theywere powerful owners.  As owners they certainly did help to build theleague but whether they developed the game is another question altogether.Are we going to honour those who contributed to the league's evolutionor are we going to honour those who contributed to the glory of the sport itself?   I can't disagree with you here.What have you heard?  The Major was the *definitive* little asshole!  Heoriginated the phrase ""if you can't beat 'em in the alley you can't beat'em on the ice.""  That was his idea of hockey.  Do you think, by chance,that Don Cherry is a classy individual?The money issue is irrelevant to the point that we would agree on, andthat is: ""it is the players that are what make the game great and not thepeople who put them on the ice""Exactly true.

"Well now, we can't judge death until we are dead right?  So, why shouldwe judge religion without having experienced it?  People have said thatreligion is bad by any account, and that it is in no way useful, etc.,but I don't totally agree with this.  Of course, we cannot really sayhow the religious folk would act had they not been exposed to religion,but some people at least seemed to be helped in some ways by it.So basically, we can not judge whether religion is the right route fora given individual, or even for a general population.  We can say thatit is not best for us personally (at least, you can choose not to usereligion--might be hard to try to find out its benefits, as you stateabove).",0
"That's nothing.  When a friend of mine went shopping for a smallsedan a few years ago, she brought me along as a token male sothe salespeople wouldn't give her the ""bimbo"" treatment.Her first choice was a Mazda 323, and second choice was a NissanSentra.  We went to a Mazda dealership and described what ""we""wanted.  We started negotiating on the price, and the salesdroidkept playing the ""let me run this price by the sales manager"".  Afterplaying the ""good salesman, bad salesman"" game, we finally told himthat if he didn't have the authority to negotiate a price, perhapswe should be speaking directly to someone who did.  He brought inthe sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trickin the book.  (Read Remar Sutton's ""Don't Get Taken Every Time"" for alist.)  Finally, after playing a few more rounds of ""you'll have towork with us on this price"", also known as ""each time you come up athousand dollars we'll come down ten"", the salesmanager gave a signal tohis two sales cronies, stood up, and said ""well, we can't come down anymore so I guess we can't help you"" and they trouped out of the room,leaving us sitting in the salesman's office all by ourselves.  Hmm.I'd read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so theycan leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer, andI mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wonderingwhy they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to thedoor.  For lack of anything better to do, I picked up the phone onthe desk and called another Mazda dealership, asked for a salesman,and began discussing what kind of price they would consider.  A fewsentences into the conversation, Mr. Salesmanager broke into the line(!) and began telling me how rude he thought it was that I would callanother dealership from ""his"" phone!  I said that since he'd announcedthat our business was over, he shouldn't care, and every time I triedto talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out ourvoices with his own.  (How did he know that I was using the phone,anyway?)  Finally, I hung up and we headed out of the showroom.Sales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and hebegins to berate us again.  We say that we won't bother him anymore,we're going next door to the Nissan dealership.Then comes the part I wish I could have videotaped.  As we go outthe front door, the sales manager SHOUTS across the entire showroom,customers and all, ""Go ahead!  You DESERVE to buy a Nissan!""So my friend bought a Sentra.",17

"<stuff deleted>Good gravy! Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains inany ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a referencepower, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance whichshould also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohmsin an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an acceptednotation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance ofthe circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*(rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omittedreference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB.So. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notationsuch as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.For power:  dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )For amplitude  dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel.It has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except forthe common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notationconvention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.Common references for audio are:	0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms	0 dBV = 1 volt	0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)	0 VU = -10dBV	(consumer gear line level)Often times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned usingthe rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is alldone to whatever reference is reasonable for the applicationor moment.Note that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linearimpedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, thepower will also increase the same amount. This proof can be donewith the above two identities and ohm's law.-- --------------------------------------------------------------------       Dave Medin			Phone:	(205) 730-3169 (w)    SSD--Networking				(205) 837-1174 (h)    Intergraph Corp.

"Now, I am jumping into the middle of this thread so I may not knowwhat y'all been talking about, but I have a few comments:There are a number of other factors that are very important, the threebiggest being air velocity, air momentum and shock waves.Velocity stacks have been used for years and are now being used insideof stock airboxes on a number of bikes.  At a tuned engine rpm, thestacks can greatly increase the speed, and thus momentum of the airrushing in.Air momentum is critical in getting good air intake: the momentum ofthe air stack outside the combustion chamber will force its way insidelong after the piston has begun its compressive up-stroke.Shock waves are used to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air fromescaping out the exzhaust ports.  Shock waves are the product of expansionchambers or any other means of presenting a 'wall' (opening or closing)to the air in motion.  Beyond this I am lost in the mystery of how theydesign for shock waves.",18

"I think the problem here is that I pretty much ignored the partabout the Jews sightseeing for 2000 years, thinking instead thatthe important part of what the original poster said was the bitabout killing Palestinians.

"This brings up an interesting subject that has not been discussed much,and probably has not been studied much.As some of you may be aware, I've posted a lot of articles lately onpersonality typing (of which the MBTI is a test vehicle).  To come upto speed, just read 'alt.psychology.personality' and/or ask for bypersonality type summary file.One observation is that people have significantly different personalities(no question on this) which seem to be essentially in-born.  With respectto church attendance and participation, some people thrive on this, whileother people have real difficulty with this because they prefer a moresolitary and contemplative lifestyle - that is, they are de-energized ifconfronted with excessive closeness to outside activities and lots ofpeople.  Of course this is measured by extroversion/introversion.My impression is that many churches are totally blind to this fact, andcreate environments that 'scare away' many who are naturally introverted(there are many introverted characters in the Bible, btw).  I know, I amquite introverted in preference, and find the 'pressure' by many churchesto participate, to meet together in large groups, etc., to be veryuncomfortable.  Knowing what I know now, these churches have been overlyinfluenced by highly extroverted people who thrive on this sort of thing.(BTW, there's nothing wrong with either extroversion or introversion, bothpreferences have their place in the Body).Maybe I should define extrovert/introvert more carefully since these wordsare usually not used correctly in our culture.  The extrovert/introvertscale is a measure of how a person is energized.  The following isexcerpted from my summary:1.  Energizing - How a person is energized:        Extroversion (E)- Preference for drawing energy from the outside                          world of people, activities or things.        Introversion (I)- Preference for drawing energy from one's internal                          world of ideas, emotions, or impressions.Hopefully this will elicit further discussion as to how churches canstructure themselves to meet the real needs of the people who comprisethe Body of Christ, instead of trying to change people's personalitiesto fit them into a particular framework.  I'm sure there are other aspectsof how churches have not properly understood personality variances amongtheir members to the detriment of all.Jon Noring-- Charter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.",7

"You can dream whatever you wish. We have demands from the Armenians.With the Government of x-Soviet Armenia, we would sit down, go overall our outstanding issues, whether it's land or reparations orrecognition, whatever it is. We'd like to sit down and ask for it.By all means, lands and properties were taken away from us and theyshould be returned to the rightful owners, the Turkish and Kurdish people, who were there 3,000 years, long before the Armenians evershowed up in that area. Entire population of the region was subjected to genocide beyond belief; genocide which was planned to exterminate the whole Turkish people of the region to the last man, woman and child. Armenians tortured and massacred millions of defenseless civilians. To assemble innocent civilians in the mosques and burn them in the buildings was one of their methods. Even today the traveler in that region is seldom free from the evidence of these Armenian crimes.If you have the stomach, I would strongly recommend the followingreferences on the Armenian genocide of the Muslims.

A genocide of Armenians took placeduring peacetime.And it was a great tragedy for me personally, because I lost my father inthose days. He was still young. Born in 1926.On that day, February 28, we were at home. Of course we had heard that there was unrest in town, my younger brother Aleksandr had told us about it. But we didn't think . . . we thought that everything would happen outdoors, that theywouldn't go into people's apartments. About five o'clock we saw a large crowd near the Kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict. We were sitting at home watching television. We go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into Mir Street. This is right near downtown, next to the airline ticket office, our house is right nearby. That day there was a group of policeman with shieldsthere. They threw rocks at those policemen. Then they moved off in the direction of our building. They burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and started shouting for Armenians to come out of the building. We switched off the light. As it turns out, their signal was just the opposite: to turn on thelight. That meant that it was an Azerbaijani home. We, of course, didn't know and thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment.Suddenly there's pounding on the door. We go to the door, all four of us:there were four of us in the apartment. Father, Mother, my younger brotherAleksandr, and I. He was born in 1959. My father was a veteran of World War II and had fought in China and in the Soviet Far East; he was a pilot.We went to the door and they started pounding on it harder, breaking it down with axes. We start to talk to them in Azerbaijani, ""What's going on? What's happened?"" They say, ""Armenians, get out of here!"" We don't open the door, we say, ""If we have to leave, we'll leave, we'll leave tomorrow."" They say, ""No, leave now, get out of here, Armenian dogs, get out of here!"" By now they've broken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides. We hold them off as bestwe can, my father and I on one side, and my mother and brother on the other. We had prepared ourselves: we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment,and grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves. They broke in the door andwhen the door gave way, we held it for another half-hour. No neighbors, nopolice and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time. We held the door. They started to smash the door on the lock side, first with an axe, and then with a crowbar.When the door gave way--they tore it off its hinges--Sasha hit one of them with the axe. The axe flew out of his hands. They also had axes, crowbars, pipes, and special rods made from armature shafts. One of them hit my father in the head. The pressure from the mob was immense. When we retreated into theroom, one of them hit my mother, too, in the left part of her face. My brotherSasha and I fought back, of course. Sasha is quite strong and hot-tempered, hewas the judo champion of Sumgait. We had hammers in our hands, and we injured several of the bandits--in the heads and in the eyes, all that went on. But they, the injured ones, fell back, and others came to take their places, therewere many of them.The door fell down at an angle. The mob tried to remove the door, so as to go into the second room and to continue . . . to finish us off. Father brought skewers and gave them to Sasha and me--we flew at them when we saw Father bleeding: his face was covered with blood, he had been wounded in the head, and his whole face was bloody. We just threw ourselves on them when we saw that. We threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall, drovethem down to the third floor. We came out on the landing, but a group of the bandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in there, having closed the door behind them. We started tearing the door off to chase away the remaining ones or finish them. Then a man, an imposing man of about 40, an Azerbaijani, came in. When he was coming in, Father fell down andMother flew to him, and started to cry out. I jumped out onto the balcony and started calling an ambulance, but then the mob started throwing stones throughthe windows of our veranda and kitchen. We live on the fourth floor. And no one came. I went into the room. It seemed to me that this man was the leader of the group. He was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a fur collar. And he addressed my mother in Azerbaijani: ""What's with you, woman, why are you shouting? What happened? Why are you shouting like that?""She says, ""What do you mean, what happened? You killed somebody!"" My father was a musician, he played the clarinet, he played at many weddings, Armenian and Azerbaijani, he played for many years. Everyone knew him. Mother says, ""The person who you killed played at thousands of Azerbaijani weddings, he brought so much joy to people, and you killed that person."" He says, ""You don't need to shout, stop shouting."" And when they heard the voice of this man, the 15 to 18 people who were in the other room opened the door and started running out. We chased after them, but they ran away. That man left, too. As we were later told, downstairs one of them told the others, I don't know if it was from fright or what, told them that we had firearms, eventhough we only fought with hammers and an axe. We raced to Father and started to massage his heart, but it was already too late. We asked the neighbors to call an ambulance. The ambulance never came, although we waited for it all evening and all through the night.Somewhere around midnight about 15 policemen came. They informed us they were from Khachmas. They said, ""We heard that a group was here at your place, you have our condolences."" They told us not to touch anything and left. Father layin the room.So we stayed home. Each of us took a hammer and a knife. We sat at home. Well,we say, if they descend on us again we'll defend ourselves. Somewhere around one o'clock in the morning two people came from the Sumgait Procuracy, investigators. They say, ""Leave everything just how it is, we're coming back here soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything.""Then people came from the Republic Procuracy too, but no one helped us take Father away. The morning came and the neighbors arrived. We wanted to take Father away somehow. We called the Procuracy and the police a couple of times,but no one came. We called an ambulance, and nobody came. Then one of the neighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should hide. We secured the door somehow or other. We left Father in the room and went up to the neighbor's.The excesses began again in the morning. The bandits came in several vehicles,ZIL panel trucks, and threw themselves out of the vehicles like . . . a landing force near the center of town. Our building was located right there. Acrowd formed. Then they started fighting with the soldiers. Then, in Buildings19 and 20, that's next to the airline ticket office, they started breaking into Armenian apartments, destroying property, and stealing. The Armenians weren't at home, they had managed to flee and hide somewhere. And again they poured in the direction of our building. They were shouting that there were some Armenians left on the fourth floor, meaning us. ""They're up there, still,up there. Let's go kill them!"" They broke up all the furniture remaining in the two rooms, threw it outside, and burned it in large fires. We were hiding one floor up. Something heavy fell. Sasha threw himself toward the door shouting that it was probably Father, they had thrown Father, were defiling the corpse, probably throwing it in the fire, going to burn it. I heard it, and the sound was kind of hollow, and I said, ""No, that's from some of the furniture."" Mother and I pounced on Sasha and stopped him somehow, and calmed him down.The mob left somewhere around eight o'clock. They smashed open the door and went into the apartment of the neighbors across from us. They were alsoArmenians, they had left for another city.The father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said, ""Are you crazy? Why are you hiding Armenians? Don't you now they're checking all the apartments? They could kill you and them!"" And to us :"" . . . Come on, leave this apartment!"" We went down to the third floor, to some other neighbors'. Atfirst the man didn't want to let us in, but then one of his sons asked him andhe relented. We stayed there until eleven o'clock at night. We heard the soundof motors. The neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers. We went downstairs. There was a light on in the room where we left Father. In the other rooms, as we found out later, all the chandeliers had been torn down. They left only one bulb. The bulb was burning, which probably was a signal they had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in ourMicrodistrict 3 where there had been a pogrom.With the help of the soldiers we made it to the City Party Committee and were saved. Our salvation--my mother's, my brother's, and mine,--was purely accidental, because, as we later found out from the neighbors, someone in the crowd shouted that we had firearms up there. Well, we fought, but we were onlyable to save Mother. We couldn't save Father. We inflicted many injuries on the bandits, some of them serious. But others came to take their places. We were also wounded, there was blood, and we were scratched all over--we got ourshare. It was a miracle we survived. We were saved by a miracle and the troops. And if troops hadn't come to Sumgait, the slaughter would have been even greater: probably all the Armenians would have been victims of the genocide.Through an acquaintance at the City Party Committee I was able to contact the leadership of the military unit that was brought into the city, and at their orders we were assigned special people to accompany us, experts. We went to 'pick up Father's corpse. We took it to the morgue. This was about two o'clock in the morning, it was already March 1, it was raining very hard and it was quite cold, and we were wearing only our suits. When my brother and I carried Father into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses. There were about six burned people in there, and the small corpse of a burned child. It was gruesome. I suffered a tremendous shock. There were about ten people there, but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were beingtaken to Baku. There was a woman's corpse there too, she had been . . . well, there was part of a body there . . . a hacked-off part of a woman's body. It was something terrible. The morgue was guarded by the landing force . . . The child that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old. It was impossibleto tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned. There was a man there, too, several men. You couldn't tell anything because their faces were disfigured, they were in such awful condition...Now two and a half months have passed. Every day I recall with horror what happened in the city of Sumgait. Every day: my father, and the death of my father, and how we fought, and the people's sorrow, and especially the morgue.I still want to say that 70 years have passed since Soviet power wasestablished, and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what happened  in Sumgait. It will go down in history.I'm particularly surprised that the mob wasn't even afraid of the troops. Theyeven fought the soldiers. Many soldiers were wounded. The mob threw fuel mixtures onto the armored personnel carriers, setting them on fire. They weren't afraid. They were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our troops. I saw the clashes on February 29 near the airline ticket office, rightacross from our building. And that mob was fighting with the soldiers. The inhabitants of some of the buildings, also Azerbaijanis, threw rocks at the soldiers from windows, balconies, even cinder blocks and glass tanks. They weren't afraid of them. I say they were sure of their impunity. When we were at the neighbors' and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket office I called the police at number 3-20-02 and said that they were robbing Armenian apartments and burning homes. And they told me that they knew that they were being burned. During those days no one from the police department came to anyone's aid. No one came to help us, either, to our home, even thoughperhaps they could have come and saved us.As we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs, near the bus station. Rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in fighting. So I think all of it was arranged in advance. They even knew in which buildings and apartments the Armenians lived, on which floors--they hadlists, the bandits. You can tell that the ""operation"" was  planned in advance.Thanks, of course, to our troops, to the country's leadership, and to theleadership of the Ministry of Defense for helping us, thanks to the Russianpeople, because the majority of the troops were Russians, and the troops suffered losses, too. I want to express this gratitude in the name of my family and in the name of all Armenians, and in the name of all SumgaitArmenians. For coming in time and averting terrible things: worse wouldhave happened if that mob had not been stopped on time.At present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the USSRProcuracy. I want to say that those bandits should receive the severestpossible punishment, because if they don't, the tragedy, the genocide, could happen again. Everyone should see that the most severe punishment is metedout for such deeds.Very many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest, in the mass disturbances. The mobs were huge. At present not all of them have been caught,very few of them have been, I think, judging by the newspaper reports. There were around 80 people near our building alone, that's how many people took part in the pogrom of our building all in all.They should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that retribution awaits those who perform such acts.

"An excellent idea.While I don't know the full scope of the activities of the EFF, from what little I've seen I think it would be better to lobby for strong cryptography through a distinct organization.The EFF has been associated with efforts to prevent the banning of sexand pictures newsgroups at various universities. Horror stories about thecontents of those groups (e.g. exploitative pictures of possibly underagedmodels) have already surfaced in the press. The White House bulletinalready raised the specter of drug-dealing and terrorism, which is only onestep removed from the old ""crypto-wielding child molester"" argument.  AnEFF lobbying effort for cryptography would be too easily derailed by theconnection to child pornography and the like.Similarly, LPF is connected with Stallman and his Gnu project.  Inlight of, say, the Gnu Manifesto, this means that in a public debate itstands to be labelled as ""communist"", ""anarchist hackers"", radical, etc.  I don't know about CPSR, but if it is an offshoot of Physicians for SocialResponsibility (best known for Helen Caldicott and her hystericalantinuclear lobbying) then it probably also carries unwelcome politicalbaggage.Perhaps for practical reasons a lobbying organization for cryptographywould best be formed under the umbrella of EFF or some other existinggroup, but its charter should then be distinct, independent, and limited toadvocacy for the right to cryptography.  To reiterate Dan Bernstein'squestion: does any suitable organization exist?

"This past winter I drove from NYC to Killington,VT 6 or 7 times in my1990 325i Convertible (talk about poor reputation in the snow!!)with an EXCELLENT set of snow tires. I put 4 Noika NR10s on in Dec. and have been sure footed in some pretty severe weather conditions ever since. I've plowed through4 - 5 inch snow covered roads effortlessly, while other cars have been paralyzed(front wheel drive included).Concentrate more on ""where the rubber meets the road"" rather than driveability of carsin snowy conditions. Drive carefully, buy good snow tires, and most cars will performadequately in less than ideal conditions.An aside: I can't praise Noika NR10 snows enough. Absolutely the BEST snow tires I have everdriven on. If you live in the snow belt, do yourself a favor and get a set of thesenext winter. Tim",17

She was after all,Mother of God, full of grace, and immaculate.And in St. Germain of Constantinople and St. John of Damascus, and inSt. Andrew of Crete, among others.And it should be noted that the Monophysite Chruches of Egypt and Syriaalso hold to this belief as part of divine revelation, even though theybroke away from the unity of the Chruch in 451 AD by rejecting theCouncil of Chalcedon.  It might be argued by some Protestants that theCatholics and Orthodox made this belief up, but the Monophysites, put abig hole in that notion, as they also hold the belief, and they splitfrom the Chruch before the belief was first annunciated in writing (asfar as is known, much has been lost from the time of the Fathers).",7

"Here is a press release from the Reserve Officers Association. Reserve Officers Say Demographics Ignored in Nominations toClose Naval, Marine Reserve Centers To: National Desk, Defense Writer Contact: Herbert M. Hart of the Reserve Officers Association of          the United States, 202-479-2258   WASHINGTON, April 13 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The Reserve OfficersAssociation of the United States has alerted the Defense BaseRealignment and Closure Commission that the services failed to givesufficient weight to demographics in recommendations made to close56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve centers.   In letters to the closure commission and to all 86 members ofCongress with affected locations in their constituencies, includingSen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, ROA charged that the developers of the Navy-Marine listignored demographics of the civilian population, particularly priorservice personnel.   ROA's executive director, Maj. Gen. Evan L. Hultman, AUS (Ret.),suggested ""concern that the only plausible alternative is that theyare intentionally attempting to foreclose the Naval Reservecomponents from maintaining even today's relatively low level ofparticipation in their parent service's Total Force of the future.""   He asked the commission ""to remove from consideration alllocations without sufficient and convincing demographic data towarrant approval of the requested action.""   ""Only a few of the 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserveinstallations on this list are large enough to have a significantimpact on the community, if closed,"" wrote Hultman.  ""The majorissue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a largepercentage of the existing locations.""   Hultman reminded the commission, ""The fact that the vastmajority of the Reserve installations on this list do not comeclose to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in thisprocess certainly supports the thesis"" that these actions aresimply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the Navy andMarine Corps Reserve.   ROA also noted ""that at the end of the 1960s, when the number ofNaval Reservists was approximately the same as today, there were 480Naval Reserve facilities.  If the Navy recommendations areapproved, there will be less than 200 Naval Reserve facilities.""   Facilities on the list include seven Naval Air Stations rangingfrom South Weymouth, Mass., to Alameda, Calif., 28 NavalReserve Centers in Macon, Ga., and Parkersburg, W.Va., toMissoula and Great Falls. Mont.  Naval/Marine Corps ReserveCenters include four in San Francisco, Fort Wayne, Ind.,Billings, Mont., and Abilene, Texas.   A major Marine Reserve Center on the list is that at ElToro, Calif., plus six others. -30-",10

On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquirecelestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2)swing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinkedto the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activityfrom April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio RelayAntenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command losstimer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for theExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was receivedproperly.5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verifythe health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experimentdata; long term trend analysis is continuing.6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine theoptimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminaryanalysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulationindex is near the optimal level.7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for theExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thrusterflushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushedduring the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significantchanges (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  Thesemeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC specialanomaly team.10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15, 1993, is as follows:       a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees           off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within           acceptable range       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within           acceptable range       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours           Time To Initiation - 260 hoursGDS (Ground Data Systems):1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance testfor the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21(Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verifythe flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller(TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacementfor the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetryrates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC TelemetrySubsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA wasnot metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTSdata from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) ofthe TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.TRAJECTORY     As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectorystatus was as follows:	Distance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU)	Distance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU)	Heliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hour	Distance from Jupiter       543,973,900 km	Round Trip Light Time       17 minutes, 4 secondsSPECIAL TOPIC",6

If I get hurt it's my own fault, but I don't want to wreck my Katana.  I developed this philosophy from an impromptu *experiment*.  I had one beer at 6:00 in the evening and had volleyball practice at 7:00.  I wasn't even close to leagle intoxication, but I couldn't perform even the most basic things until 8:30!

"I'm still catching up from Spring Break, but bear with me...Javy Lopez has proven, over 1400+ AB in the minor leagues, that he isready to play in the majors. He is *not* being rushed. Players who areclearly too good for AA and play behind stiffs at the major league levelare wasting their time, and may actually have a court case againstmajor league management for keeping them, at AAA.Unless Lopez is *me* defensively (I'm 5'7'', 165 and born to playsecond base :-)), he belongs in the major leagues.Valentine isn't saying he should back up. He's saying he should be putin a position to *win* the job in the major leagues, which, IMHO, hewould if given the opportunity. (Val, if I'm misinterpreting, pleaselet me know.)But the players who *are* ready are 1)the best and 2) the ones mostlikely to benefit from being in the majors. Javy Lopez is not a middle-of-the-road prospect. He's the real thing. NOW. Again, the most important thing a player can do is hit. Lopez does thatmiles better than Olson or Berryhill. If his defense is good enough forGreenville, or Richmond, it's good enough for Atlanta. If he really wasawful defensively, he would no longer be a catcher. See Sprague, Ed.Oh, where to start... OK. First of all, solid != good. I want good players.Solid is one of those words used to describe nice white guys who reallyaren't very good at baseball. Think of it as ""TWG"" without the caps.It's a losing strategy to say, ""We have solid guys, we don't need to improve.""You used it four times in that paragraph, BTW.Same for experienced. I might add, though, that Greg Olson and DamonBerryhill aren't exactly Carter and Fisk. Olson has played three years,Berryhill five, although 90 and 91 were a wash. The only difference,IMHO, between Olson and Valle is the supporting cast.""Two big bats."" Hrm. I like Justice, but I find Mr. Gant's trend disturbing.Call it one and a maybe. The Braves' platoon is OK, but neither playerhas *any* value outside of the platoon. Bream vs. LH and Hunter vs. RHare awful. I'll leave the thirdbase comment alone. Pendleton has wastedtoo much bandwidth already. If the CF platoon hits .300, I'll retraceMr. Likhani's midnight run down Forbes, and I live in NY and LA.(Got that, Mike?)And doesn't Cox call pitches, anyway?Nope. They're baseball management, possible the most short-sighted collection of people in the nation. Do you not believe this goes on,Mark? Do you think Frank Thomas needed those three months in AAA in1990? Or Cal Eldred wasn't *really* better than Ricky Bones last year?You're mostly polite; make defensible, if flawed cases; have wit andhave, in the past, admitted being wrong. That does qualify you on r.s.b.We'll make an SDCN out of you, yet :-)",19

To accomplish this, we will be putting out a two diskset, the first containing what's ready and needed now, the secondavailable later in '92, containing more SPARC binaries and otheruseful material not found on previous disks.The SUG 1992.1 disk, which was assembled by Robert A.

"I saw an interesting product in NY Auto Show, and would like to hear your comments.MILITECH(tm) is yet another oil additive. But the demonstration of thisproduct really impressive, if it didn't cheat.The setup of the demo is fairly simple. A cone shaped rotor ishalf submerged in a small oil sink, filled with motor oil. The rotoris powered by an electronic motor. A metal pad is pressed againstthe rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction. The torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench.Before MILITECH was added, the rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ftof torque (You pick the brand of oil, no difference). Once MILITECH was added to the oil, the rotor could not be stopped even with 120+ lb-ft oftorque. Here is the good part: even after the salesman emptied the oil sink, you still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained  on it.They say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles. A 16 ozbottle is $25.I still have my doubts. If this product is really so great, why it wasso little known? The salesman said it is widely used in military. I didn'tbelieve it.  The demo was so impressive, that I bought a bottle againstmy common sense.Has anyone heard of or actually used this product? Is it real?If you are going to the auto show, please visit this stand on the second floor. See if can find out if the demo is a hoax or not.",17
"#In <mcclaryC5snpq.KB1@netcom.com> mcclary@netcom.com (Michael McClary)#        Just thought I'd clear up a few of the murky areas...##>Actually, after surviving being driven out of Nauvoo, and later Carthage,#>the Mormons DID fortify Utah.  They still arm themselves to ""defend the#>faith"", and stockpile food as well.  They have been involved in quite a#>lot of illegal activity - including multiple (and often underage) wives#>for the leaders - a practice still in vogue with some splinters of their#>sect.  The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking.#                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^By ""they,"" you mean the leaders of the lds church?  I grant you that whenJoseph Smith was still alive, plenty of ""accusations"" were filed, most ofwhich had little bearing with reality, as evidenced by various verdicts.I have studied lds history for 15 years now, and I have yet to see provethat the lds leadership was involved, in quote: ""illegal activities.""Plural marriage, yes, but your charge of ""underage"" wives sounds like itcould have originated from a tabloid, and discredits the high moralstandards which characterized these leaders and families, unlike, as itappears, those of David Koresh.#        Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyram#were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over#who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like#Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider#Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I'm led to understand.  Make#no mistake, this was no messiah we're talking about in Smith).  TheAnd neither did he claim he was.  As the church reflects the moralaptitude of its leaders (and especially those of Joseph Smith), I havenothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only ""crime""was that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  Many have triedto explain the ""Smith phenomenon"" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5million member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith'stestimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.#thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed#down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only#entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have#been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The#Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn't of much help#here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects.#Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited#for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other#claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)""The rest"" were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church,while the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the variousauxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the newprophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures anddoctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST inline to fill the prophet Joseph Smith's vacancy: he was the seniorapostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicatedthat it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.Other rightful ""heirs"" were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated(Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified,Joseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an emptyland beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This""Rekhabite"" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipatedby the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.Granted, a couple of ""do-it-yourselfers"" stayed behind, unwilling tosacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, butthis also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  Thechurch benefitted from this purification process: they became evenmore unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.#        Both sects practiced the ""1-year food stockpile"" doctrine,#and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at#least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a#militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than#face large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered a#great deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quite#justified in making military training a good thing.  Remember,#this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people#had nobody to turn to save themselves.##        Just a little context to put this all in perspective.BTW, since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (one ofthe largest denominations in the country) a ""sect""???  It didn't ""splinter""from any other religion, as did say, the Southern Baptists or Methodists.#>So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J. Edgar Hoover was very#>impressed with the way they kept secrets.  (They're pledged to defend#>secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood.  Many actually#>do - even to the point of suicide.)What a balloney.  Suicide is sinful and against the law of God.  I amnot comfortable with this alleged ""cosiness"" with Mammon: I assure youthat *many* among us reject this attitude categorically.  Period.  OurONLY true allegiance is to our God and to the leaders which He hasappointed to represent Him.  In any regard, to read this TRASH (aboutsuicide and ""atone for sins with blood"") is yet another insultingmisrepresentation of what my church believes in and stands for...##        The RLDS, the Reorganized LDS, are friendly rivals of the LDS#and delight in telling stories about them, which generates quick retorts#from the LDS members and everybody has a grand time.  At no time have#I ever even heard this hinted at.  I'm taking it with a salt block.Make it a really big salt mountain with a glacier on top.#>  So he hired virtually no one but#>Mormons, until the FBI was almost exclusively staffed by members of the#>Church of Later Day Saints.  Though J. Edgar is finally gone, the FBI#>personnel (especially the field agents) are still heavily Mormon.#>I have often wondered how this might affect the FBI's treatment#>of religious organizations a Mormon would consider heretical.Preposterous.  Even if this were true (reliable data, please), Iam convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codesof honor and conduct (that's why they were selected for in thefirst place, remember?).  Besides, one of our Articles of FaithSTRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion, and that allpeople are free to worship ""*how*, *where*, or *what* they may.""#        If it's true, there would be little affect.  LDS and RLDS#philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true#Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his#own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may#as well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  You#can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected#it.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to#Buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they#will not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hoover#liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade#alcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like.#These people are the ""salt of the Earth"" and as such are more#easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.A good explanation, I can accept that.  You are right that lds peopleare sometimes a little too cosy with Mammon's ""orders"" (the latepresident Kimball, for example, was an exception with his strongopposition of the selection of the MX ""Peace Keeper"" missile mazein Utah).#        That's my somewhat educated guess, anyway.

"It did it again.  This morning, my 88 Ford Ranger was idling at 10,000 RPM.Ok, so I exaggerated a little, but it was idling very fast.  It has a 2liter carburated engine in it, and no blipping of the throttle wouldcause the idle to drop back to normal (I don't think the linkage is stuck).What can I do to fix this problem?  This has been a problem from time totime, but has straightened itself out - until now.  I don't have a tach,but by gauging by the sound of the engine, it is idling about twice as fastas it should be.  This is down from what it was idling at when I pulled upat a stop light.Many thanks for any suggestions. - les",17

"Well, these are Armenian and Jewish scholars, not me. Denying the obvious?Source: Hovannisian, Richard G.: Armenia on the Road to Independence, 1918.University of California Press (Berkeley and Los Angeles), 1967, p. 13.""The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem. Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the  Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897, however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character  notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian  Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the  southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.""  (See also Map 1. Historic Armenia and Map 4. Administrative subdivisions of  Transcaucasia).In 1920, '0' percent Turk. ""We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as  ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work  of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village.  Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts  into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable  and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets  completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They  found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border  into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole  length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to  Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain  plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of  Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for  howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the  scattered bones of the dead.""

It is in our power to tear away the veil of illusion that some of us  create for ourselves. It certainly is possible to severe the artificial  life-support system of an imagined 'ethnic purity' that some of us  falsely trust as the only structure that can support their heart beats   in this alien land.""            (Sahak Melkonian - 1920 - ""Preserving the Armenian purity"") <1993Apr24.042427.29323@walter.bellcore.com>ddc@nyquist.bellcore.com (Daniel Dusan Chukurov 21324)No kidding. The Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces,massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between 1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocentTurks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia today.A merciless massacre of the civilian population of the small Azeri town of Khojali (Pop. 6000) in Karabagh, Azerbaijan, is reported to have taken place on the night of Feb. 28 under a coordinated military operation of the 366th mechanized division of the CIS army and the Armenian insurgents. Close to 1000 people are reported to have been massacred. Elderly and children were not spared. Many were badly beaten and shot at close range. A sense of rage and helplessness has overwhelmed the Azeri population in face of the well armed and equipped Armenian insurgency. The neighboring Azeri city of Aghdam outside of theKarabagh region has come under heavy Armenian artillery shelling. City hospital was hit and two pregnant women as well as a new born infant were killed. Azerbaijan is appealing to the international community to condemn such barbaric and ruthless attacks on its population and its sovereignty.Serdar Argic",9

"It seems to me that you are the one who is supposed to do some reading. I thinkthat our major difference in opinion is on the legitimacy of Sevres. First, thattreaty was signed by the Ottoman Empire therefore legally it does not bind the Republic of Turkey. The new independence movement (which by the way, is not the same as the Young Turks) naturally rejected it out of hand. to say that we should accept because the Germans did theirs is absurd. We saw what the cosequences of such harsh treaties were in Hitler. Second, the Sevres treaty was even worse than Versailles. It divided the Ottoman Empire in to several influence zones, had the capital occupied, the economy under Allied control, the army diminished to nothing but a police force, in short a country in name only. I'dwonder if you would like to live under such conditions. And for the record, I donot feel sorry for the soldiers killed in IZMIR harbour. Before evacuating the city, the Greek forces burned it down, so it serves them right.As for being fooled by Allied promises, that too is your fault.

"Isn't that interesting?!  In the Jewish tradition you are incrediblywrong!  They originate in the Torah and with Jewish ancestors,specifically the Patriarch Abraham (z""l).

This assured thatIsaac only, who remained with Abraham, would inherit his most importantspiritual gifts, what eventually became Judaism.So you see, other religions can have very parochial views too.

"I disagree.  McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out thecrowds whether or not the team is expected to do well.  Very few fans real-istically expect the Kings to do well this year (although I do) and yet theystill go out to see Gretzky.  This is the marketing strategy - selling thegame by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and, notably, theNBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is bringing to the league.  They have gone on record as stating that they aretrying to sell the game on its stars.  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect examples of players that real fans know aren't worth a damn and yet, beingbenificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totalsthat would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the NHL wants toattract, that these players are indeed superstars.It ain't nearly so simple as this.  The casual fan doesn't think about much at all.  Can you actually find an adult with a 3 digit IQ who believes thatMcDonalds makes good hamburgers? Yes but apparently the Rocket has not lived up to his marketing responsi-bilities has he?

Pediatrics for me was three solidmonths of illness, and I had a temp of 104 when I took the final exam!I think what happens is that during training, and beyond, we are constantlyexposed to new things, and we have the usual reactions to them, so that lateron, when challenged with something, it is more likely a re-exposure for us,so we deal with it well and get a mild illness.

JPEG is designed for compressing eitherfull-color or gray-scale digital images of ""natural"", real-world scenes.It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or linedrawings.JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does ithandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those typesof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEGrespectively.JPEG is ""lossy"", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn'tquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves muchof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notablythe fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small detailsof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that willbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, thesmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they areinvisible to the eye.A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied byadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can tradeoff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* smallfiles if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing imagearchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if youaren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, youcan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.[2]  Why use JPEG?There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files acrossnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference indisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, thesize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have toconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Evenwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG imagethan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, usingJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order tostore or transmit an image more cheaply.It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, thetime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than theextra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenetposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you haveonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantageto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete asblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailedin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images amongpeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerablymore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the firstthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color orgray-scale images of ""realistic"" scenes; that means scanned photographs andsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit displayhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixelsthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeedby GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does withoutintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but theyshould be avoided in JPEG files.)JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixelsadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend tocome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, thissort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairlyoften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness isparticularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall betweenscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex andsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scaleimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale imagesof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether youshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, onlyapplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start froma GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEGcan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justifyconverting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Beprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will notconvert well.[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I havehandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first threefiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEGsoftware described in section 6B.File	   Size in bytes		Commentsship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)ship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.			 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.ship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color			 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once.ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look			 for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25			 JPEG's characteristic ""blockiness"" becomes apparent			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).			 Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were			 of poorer image quality than this.ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smallerthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as theGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typicalratio for real-world scenes.[5]  What are good ""quality"" settings for JPEG?Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff byselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion aboutthe meaning of these settings.  ""Quality 95"" does NOT mean ""keep 95% of theinformation"", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;it's not a percentage of anything.The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable fromthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from oneobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  Thissetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in atypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except forexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce afile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able togo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, youmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and areprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 isabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as ""op art"".(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEGsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  OtherJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely differentquality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just""high""/""medium""/""low""-style choices.)[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article ""How to find sources"".(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in thesame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you canget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with""send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources"" in the body.  The ""Anonymous FTPList FAQ"" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq inthe news.answers archive.NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couplemonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.[6A]  If you are looking for ""canned"" software, viewers, etc:The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on onekind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check outthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that thislist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain overInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.X Windows:John Bradley's free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG,GIF, and other image formats.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.eduor ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called 'xv-???.tar.Z' (where ??? is theversion number, currently 2.21); it is located in the 'contrib' directory onexport or the 'pub/xv' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bitsinternally, which means it's not a real good choice if you have a 24-bitdisplay (you'll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn't use XV toconvert full-color images to JPEG, because they'll get color-quantized first.But XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.CAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to checkthe ""save at normal size"" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file willbe blurry.Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  TheImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormappeddisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or thebasic free JPEG software.Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simpleimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latestrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,file contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the currentxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The nextxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available fromexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are saidto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.MS-DOS:This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.The current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basicviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface isnot flashy, but it's functional.Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  Thecurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTEbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPUand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows andOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are nobigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fiton the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that itslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is abit tricky; read the directions carefully!A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier toinstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface isalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but alittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger thanscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and bothare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available fromSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zipor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-inVESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complainsthat the driver is missing.)A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking aroundthe net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortlyand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latestrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality ispoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see agood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 andmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of theseviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programsto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If youhave hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try tofind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the rightthing with hi-color displays.)The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (orjpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOScompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they willconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; inparticular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The majoradvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietaryJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-formatfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it fromSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it isnot readable on non-PC platforms.Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulationpackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSIformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 andmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programsis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this documentrefers to directory (eg) ""msdos/graphics"" at Simtel20, that really means""pd1:<msdos.graphics>"".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you shouldexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are severalInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USAmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 filesin (eg) ""/pub/msdos/graphics"".  If you have no FTP capability, you canretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings incomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.Microsoft Windows:There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversionprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frillsviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while itdecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out thedecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEGfiles, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other usefulfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it'san excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available fromftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment andslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirrorsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,which is roughly 25% faster.)ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promisingcontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point ithas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, thecurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, filepub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version willbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screenmode, not in a window.OS/2:The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderatoris not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4./pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip    Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20./pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip    PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.Macintosh:Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part ofthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be runningSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also installthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can getQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster andconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, isnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 fordetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing imagesthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also canconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a bigimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 andQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best colorimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView canview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it'sthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on atypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it downto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most otherviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some peoplelike this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is verywell thought out.GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF andPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latestversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, butit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversioncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot ofplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter canload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet ifyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, tryconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, isavailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIFconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using thisprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, andGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixiefrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it'sreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it producesrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is anunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does notintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, calledPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trashit, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a muchcleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note thatPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, butit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it onolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can'tuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of adownloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If youdon't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although notall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEGplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloadedJPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.Amiga:(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive atamiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of thisarchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a goodchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being ageneral image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can readseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo versionis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), fileamiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images largerthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, evencapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  Thecurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirrorsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory issupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run underAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), fileamiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packagesthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, andImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both aredistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulationsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is anotherwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas fromamiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, fileAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, manybased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanksto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, withoutso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are ""AugJPEG"", ""NewAmyJPEG"",""VJPEG"", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk spaceit's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.Atari ST:The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.I have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris,but surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.Acorn Archimedes:!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and viewJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handleJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can befound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available byregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/writefunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other imageformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but notnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.Portable software for almost any system:If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the freeJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have adisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targaor PPM 24-bit image files.There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up everyday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you findthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whetherthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it canhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases arenot and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the IndependentJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,documentation, and some small test files is available from several places.The ""official"" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current releaseis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget toretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you mayprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTEabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available onCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearestcomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQarticle ""How to find sources"", referred to at the top of section 6.)The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG ""JFIF"" format and imagefiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in otherprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we havetested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement inproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as withanything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like tocontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, thecomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representativecolors.  This process is called ""color quantization"".  (This is somethingof a misnomer, ""color selection"" would be a better term.  We're stuck withthe standard usage though.)Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for mostimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impacton the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except atthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for displayon 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, whatcomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a littledifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probablycome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets ""smeared""into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required todisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the imagesource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk aboutthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to countthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give youdifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally seeposted images described as ""256-color JPEG"".  This tells me that the poster(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), butnumber of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in itspalette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that thesender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender'squantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors thanwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorerimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantizationalgorithm, you're out of luck.For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image qualityfor all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's displayhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of futureimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research inthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEGimages you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what wassent.It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rathershoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGAdisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than youneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two colorquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it'salso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to usehigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and innormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to bedisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the averageGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit displayhardware already: 15-bit ""hi-color"" PC displays, true 24-bit displays onworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is alreadyobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of theirdisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing imagesin a machine-independent fashion.[8]  How does JPEG work?The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosinetransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropycoding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say morethan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help inusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.[9]  What about lossless JPEG?There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee diddefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees thefinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, thislossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEGalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very fewimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.Saying ""-Q 100"" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficientquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in thecolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say""-sample 1x1"" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercialJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEGalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors invarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixelvalue; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhapshalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEGprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guaranteesbit-for-bit accuracy.If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with lessthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into theJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEGlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with aHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee wasprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the internationalstandards organizations.Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree ona common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence ofofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to""do their own thing"", and as a result their programs aren't compatible withanybody else's.The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some workthat's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have definedtwo JPEG-based file formats:  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a ""low-end"" format that transports    pixels and not much else.  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is    a ""high-end"" format that will let you record just about everything you    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the    mix will do anything to improve this situation.Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendorsof JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercialproducts will adhere to one or both standards.I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF inpicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; theTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is stillunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is welldefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported ""lowest commondenominator""; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTimesoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrappedinside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF andQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs areavailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editorthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIFby hand; see section 11 for details.Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF andImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIFformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed byHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not beused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (Thisapplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIFformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-formatfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likelyto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tellwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a    ""raw JPEG"" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---    it's worth a try, anyway.3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),    try stripping off everything before that.In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is	""begin"" line	M_]C_X ...whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with	""begin"" line	M:'-I ...If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble ofdownloading non-JFIF files.[12]  What about arithmetic coding?The JPEG spec defines two different ""back end"" modules for the final outputof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usuallyproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic codingproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All thefile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by theJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licensesfrom these companies.  (The ""fair use"" doctrine allows people to implementand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubiousat best.)At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry aboutarithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify thepotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in thefuture.  Stay tuned for further details.[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you coulddecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress itwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an alteredimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost thefirst time around.The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompressit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get anidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the currentfree JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundofferror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventuallydegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generationoutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error canbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be thatcompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the originalquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changesas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, butthat's a mighty limited capability!)The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage andtransmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediateformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you areready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lotof compression/decompression time this way :-).[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if youconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the originalfull-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG fromthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimumloss of quality.The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, tomake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher qualitysetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained insection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colorsdon't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable qualitywill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the bestcandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offerthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don'texpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those createddirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may haveto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-throughJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-colorborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms ofstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharpborder boundary can create visible artifacts (""ghost"" edges).  Do yourselfa favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windowssystem, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painlessway to do this.)cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, butfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoidimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higherQ setting may not be necessary.)Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually ""dithered"" to foolyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often ofsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixelstogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  Thetrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequencycolor noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEGfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would havegotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).To get around this, you want to ""smooth"" the GIF image before compression.Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color thatyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapidcolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing willoften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size ofthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output imagethan you'd get without smoothing.With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothingcapability is built in.  Try ""-smooth 10"" or so when converting GIFs.Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handeddithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regularfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strongsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blurthe output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processingwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such aspnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother isa LOT faster than pnmconvol...The upshot of all this is that ""cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10"" is probably agood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about theimage, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.---------------------For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software inparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.",1
"-*-----These effects are a very real concern in conducting studies of newtreatments.  Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by performing studies that are ""blind"" in various ways.  Some of theseare:  o  The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a      placebo or the test treatment, i.e., whether they are in the     control group or the test group.  o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects      receive a placebo or the test treatment.  o  Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects     receive a placebo or the test treatment.Obviously, at the point at which the data is analyzed, one has to differentiate the test group from the control group.  But the analysisis quasi-public: the researcher describes it and presents the data onwhich it is based so that others can verify it.  It is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects areanimals, such as mice, there were many cases of skewed results becausethose who performed the study did not ""blind"" themselves.  It is notconsidered so important to make mice more ignorant than they alreadyare, though it is important that in all respects except the one tested,the control and test groups are treated alike.",5

"This was posted to the firearms-politics mailing list.==============================================================Hi Folks;Wednesday marked day 2, the beginning of the trial.  Openingstatements were given by both the prosecution and the defense,each side presenting its version of what happenned last August.The prosecution argued that Weaver and his family moved toIdaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the ""evil"" federalgovernment.  The prosecution alleges that Weaver sold federalagents ""sawed off"" shotguns and later failed to appear fortrial: Despite repeated ""good faith"" efforts to get Weaverto surrender peacefully, Weaver refused.  The shootout eruptedwhen Weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission andbegan firing.  According to the prosecution, three peoplewere taking an ""offensive action"" against an FBI helicopterwhen an FBI sniper killed Vicki Weaver.The defense argued that Weaver and his family moved to northernIdaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace.  They wantedsimply to be left alone.  Weaver was induced by federal agents tosell the short-barrelled shotgun (and did not, as the prosecutionalleged, want to become a ""regular supplier"").  The defense alsoargued that the federal government sought to arrest Weaver whenhe wouldn't become an informant [it is not specified explicitly,but I assume that this is a reference to the white separatistangle of the story.  We'll know more as things develop].  Thefailure to appear in court happenned because Weaver was givenan incorrect court date and then indicted before that date.The shootout occurred when federal agent Arthur Roderick killedWeaver's dog that was in proximity to Weaver's son, Samuel.  Weaverthen fired in self-defense.  In the ensuing battle, federalagent William Degan was killed (when his gun was later found,there were 7 .223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic:However, agents were near the body for an extended period oftime and could have played with the select-fire - this willhave to be more fully explained).  Finally, the defense claimsthat Vicki Weaver was only going to ""look at the body"" [not recover?]of her son when she was cut-down by an FBI sniper.Prosecution quote: ""Weaver wanted that confrontation, and he madethat confrontation."" -- Asst. U.S. Attorney Kim LindquistDefense quote: ""The evidence in this case is going to show thatthis is a case where Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris are chargedwith crimes they didn't commit in order to cover crimes thatthe government did commit.""  -- Gerry Spence  [nice soundbite!]Notes: The _Idaho Statesman_ claims that Weaver supportersheeded a call from Spence not to repeat yesterday's protestsoutside the courthouse.  However, the local NBC affiliateagain had footage on the 10:00 news with 5 supporters including""Tim"" again.  ""Tim"" claimed he was a skinhead, who were ""ordinary,working class people.""  He also claimed he was for ""white pride,not white power.""Outside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interviewwith Bo Gritz, who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactlywhat the government wants to smear Randy Weaver.In an affiliated article carried in the _Idaho Statesman_, abouta dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into thecourthouse.  These lawyers were present to watch Gerry Spencein action, and to perhaps learn something from him.  Sometidbits: Spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son Kentwere volunteering their time to represent Weaver because theybelieved in him.  Spence, during his 90-minute opening statement,repeatedly walked behind Weaver and placed his hands on thedefendants shoulders (Weaver broke down and cried during therecounting of his wife's death), and Spence compared the ""sawedoff"" shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 (anothergood one!).Today (Thursday, April 15th) the prosecution was scheduled tobegin presenting evidence.Drew=============================================================",8

If you wait untilthe last minute to get in the left lane you won't, cause these yoyoswon't make room.We have a particularly bad strech here in Merryland just over the CabinJohn bridge. There are two very long entry ramps which all the hurry-upyahoos dive into cause they want to get ahead. When we get to the pointwhere these ramps merge, all hell breaks lose. The result is that trafficwhich was moving at 55 on the VA side of the bridge, stalls on t'otherside. If these dingbats had stayed in lane, allowed the folks coming upthe two ramps to merge, we would still be doing 55. Instead we do start-stop for 4 miles. Dave Barry's idea of a laser equipped car would bereal useful here.Bob",17

"Read this through once or twice.  Then replace ""prince"" with""government"" or ""president"", as appropriate, and read it again.  [From Chapter XX of _The Prince_, by N. Macchiavelli, as translated byDaniel Donno.]	In order to keep their lands secure, some princes havedisarmed their subjects; others have prompted division within thecities they have subjugated.  Some have nurtured animosities againstthemselves; others have sought to win the approval of those theyinitially distrusted.  Some have erected fortresses; others havedestroyed them.  Now, although it is impossible to set down definitejudgements on all of these measures without considering the particularcircumstances of the states where they may be employed, I shallnevertheless discuss them in such broad terms as the subject itselfwill allow.	To begin with, there has never been a case of a new princedisarming his subjects.  Indeed, whenever he found them disarmed, heproceeded to arm them.  For by arming your subjects, you make theirarms your own.  Those among them who are suspicious become loyal,while those who are already loyal remain so, and from subjects theyare transformed into partisans.  Though you cannot arm them all,nonetheless you increase your safety among those you leave unarmed byextending privileges to those you arm.  Your different treatment ofthe two categories will make the latter feel obligated to you, whilethe former will consider it proper thoat those who assume added dutiesand dangers should receive advantages.  	When you disarm your subjects, however, you offend them, byshowing that, either from cowardliness or from lack of faith, youdistrust them; and either conclusion will induce them to hate you.Moreover, since it is impossible for you to remain unarmed, you wouldhave to resort to mercenaries, whose limitations have already beendiscussed. Even if such troops were good, however, they could never begood enough to defend you from powerful enemies, and doubtfulsubjects.  Therefore, as I have said, a new prince in a newly acquiredstate has always taken measures to arm his subjects, and history isfull of examples proving that this is so.	But when a prince takes posession of a new state which heannexes as an addition to his original domain, then he must disarm allthe subjects of the new state except those who helped him to acquireit; and these, as time and occasion permit, he must seek to rendersoft and weak.  He must arrange matters in such a way that the arms ofthe entire state will be in the hands of soldiers who are native tohis original domain.	...",3

"04/16/93 1045  ARMENIA SAYS IT COULD SHOOT DOWN TURKISH PLANESBy David LjunggrenMOSCOW, April 16, Reuter - Armenia accused Turkey on Friday of flying weaponsx and troops across Armenian airspace to Azerbaijan and strongly hinted itmight try to shoot the planes down, local journalists in Yerevan said.Separately, Itar-Tass news agency said Armenian forces had halted their latestoffensive which has swallowed up one-tenth of Azerbaijan and sent tensions inthe Transcaucasian region soaring.The journalists in the Armenian capital quoted Armen Duliyan, head of theArmenian defence ministry press centre, as saying Ankara had been sending planes up to 15 times a day to Azerbaijan with arms and troops.It looks as though the Armenian leadership will have to warn Turkey aboutthe impermissibility of such actions,"" the journalists quoted Duliyan as saying.""If such steps are pursued in the future we will have recourse to appropriatemeasures. We have all the necessary means, including modern anti-aircraftunits.""Turkey, which shares a border with Armenia, has supported Azerbaijan in theconflict over the mainly Armenian-populated Nagorno-Karabakh region in whichmore than 2,500 people have been killed since fighting erupted in 1988.The Turkish foreign ministry said on Friday it had so far sent one plane toAzerbaijan containing humanitarian aid.A Turkish foreign ministry spokesman on Thursday would not comment directlyon a report by Hurriyet newspaper that a first consignment of rockets, rocketlaunchers, ammunition and light weapons had arrived in Azerbaijan from Turkey.Duliyan said Turkey had been sending up to 30 trucks a day carrying troopsand arms to the bordering Azeri autonomous territory of Nakhichevan, from wherethey were flown across Armenian airspace to the Azeri capital Baku.""All the responsibility for possible consequences will be borne by thecountry which is affording military assistance over our airspace,"" he said.Armenia denies any formal role in the conflict, saying that the troops involved in the fighting are from the enclave itself.Tass said the Karabakh forces decided on Friday to suspend their offensivealong the entire Armenian-Azerbaijani front.""The Karabakh authorities are reportedly ready to give independentinspectors a chance to see for themselves on the spot that the (enclave's)leadership is striving to achieve a ceasefire,"" the agency said.Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan called for a two-stage ceasefire inKarabakh when he arrived in the Belarus capital Minsk on Friday for a summit ofCommonwealth leaders.""The first stage of the settlement should involve a ceasefire and securing theprotection of the Karabakh population,"" Tass quoted him as saying.     At least 10 ceasefires have been brokered in the conflict but all havecollapsed.""The second stage should involve discussing and finding a solution to thelegal issues: that is, a clarification of the status of Nagorno-Karabakh,"" hesaid. The republic declared full independence last year but the move has not been recognised by any other country.Armenia insists that a separate Karabakh delegation should take part in futurepeace talks, something Azerbaijan rejects.Local news agencies in Baku said on Friday that Interior Minister IskenderGamidov, a fiery nationalist and hardliner in the territorial dispute withArmenia, had resigned.Turan news agency said he quit on Thursday and had cleared his office.Khabar-Servis agency said he would be replaced by the military commandant ofBaku, police Major-General Abdullah Allakhverdiyev.

Baltimore OriolesWhy the Orioles?  Well, I pondered long and hard, and it all came down tothis:  -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction.  -- Can't bring myself to pick the Yankees  -- Milwaukee was a fluke  -- Indians aren't ready to contend  -- Red Sox were bad last year, and didn't get any better  -- Detroit's pitching will be the new definition of ""replacement level""""But you don't really think the Orioles will win, do you.""  No.  As a matterof fact, I can't see any team in the American League winning either divisionon paper (with the possible exception of the Yankees, who I hate).  But some-body has to win, so I pick the Orioles.  ""You don't really think that BradyAnderson is going to repeat, do you?""  No.  I'm basing the Orioles predictionon the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis.  ""GlennDavis?  That's insane"".  Yes.  So, without further ado:STRONG POINTS:  Hoiles, Ripken some years, Olson, getting rid of Billy Ripken.WEAK POINTS:  Segui may start.  Valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be  the fifth starter.  Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup.  (Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize  the effect of a slumping Ripken?  If you can't move Ripken out of the #3  spot, why not move the rest of the line up?)WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year.WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  In a tight pennant race, team trades for Pecota.ObPrediction:  ""The Streak"" continues.  Harold Reynolds leads the team in  caught stealing.2. New York Yankees.STRONG POINTS:  Abbot, Key, Perez.  Could have best pitching in American  League.  Boggs should improve on Hayes.WEAK POINTS:  Mattingly still considered best hitter.  The Steinbrenner   factor.  (The Yankees lost to the Mets.  Can wholesale changes be far  behind?)  Never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. Wickman & Millitello) to  win a division.WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Boggs hits over .300WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Howe gets arrested again.ObPrediction:  Mattingly won't top a 700 OPS.3.  Toronto Blue JaysSTRONG POINTS:  Management willing to make big deals.  Management has eerie  power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects.  Olerud.  Guzman.  Alomar.WEAK POINTS:  The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick.  Losing Stewart may hurt rotation (that's *really* a bad sign).  No one in  the outfield can get on base.  Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward.WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in AugustWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Club makes no major deals in August.ObPrediction:  Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year.  And  have a losing record.4.  Milwaukee BrewersSTRONG POINTS:  Pitching staff was exceptional -- last year.WEAK POINTS:  Molitor gone.  Surhoff at third?  Why?

"I'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.Early in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate onhis old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so Iactually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.I proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet androde around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided toinvest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around thenI also passed my road test.On May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),I had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,skidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into theoncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic wasalso stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid undera car and been killed.Now this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took theExperienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier trainingcould have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greatersince you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuffas I did.So my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  Iwouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless youhappen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace untilyou're ready to use it.While you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks inDC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could yousave up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,plus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make surethe machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-upmachine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registrationand licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 notincluding the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.I pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200in Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantialcoverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to bepoor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergomore expensive.There used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcyclemagazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new orrecent models might be available.  You could probably look throughpast issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My firstbike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's adviceinstead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or thatare parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike bynoticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running aroundand they were generally set up the way I wanted.Nothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visitingshowrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping,were very nice about letting you look around their showrooms andquoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hencecheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.",18

In view of therumors circulating it is expected that an inquiry will be instigated.			- - - Reference - - -[1] _New York Times_, December 23, 1924, page 3, column 2 (bottom)			- - - - - - - - - - - -On the 78th Commemorative Anniversary of the Turkish genocide of the Armenians,we remember those whose only crime was to be Armenian in the shadow of an emerging Turkish proto-fascist state. In their names we demand justice.In April 1915, the Turkish government began a systematically executed de-population of the eastern Anatolian homeland of the Armenians through a genocidal extermination. This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusivelyruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The result: 1.5 million murdered, 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolenand plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3,000 years of Armenian civilizationon those lands. Today, the Turkish government continues to scrape clean anyvestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Today's Turkishgovernmental policy is to re-write the history of the era, to manufacturedistortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In the face of refutation ad nauseam, the Turkish Historical Society and cronies shamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy merely demonstrates that in the modern era, genocide is an effective state policy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. A crime unpunished is a crime encouraged. Adolf Hitler took this cue less than 25 years after the successful genocide of the Armenians.Turkey claims there was no systematic deportation of Armenians, yet...Armenians were removed from every city, town, and village in the whole of Turkey! Armenians who resisted deportation and massacre are referred to as ""rebels"".Turkey claims there was no genocide of the Armenians, yet...Turkish populationfigures today show zero Armenians in eastern Turkey, the Armenian homeland.Turkey claims Armenians were always a small minority, yet...Turkey claims Armenians were a ""threat"".In a final insult to the victims, the Republic of Turkey sold the bones of approximately 100,000 murdered Armenians for profit to Europe.Today, the Turkish government is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. Thesuccess of this genocide is hangs over the heads of Turkey's Kurdishpopulation.The Armenians demand recognition, reparation, return of Armenian land andproperty lost as a result of this genocide.ARMENIANS DEMAND JUSTICE                              ERMENILER ADALET ISTIYOR",9

"Hello all,If anyone knows of a place to get the case to hold the power supply andmotherboard of a Quadra 950 please let me know.  I have tried some mailorder places and some local stores.  Both groups would prefer that I partwith over $1000 to get just the case.  In my eyes this seems about $600-$700to much.  Any comments?  I currently own the guts of a 950.Please email me or post to this group w/ info,",14

"This thread brings back memorys of an expensive day in traffic courta few years ago.  While I was waiting my turn to state my case andplea of why I was going 75 in a 55 in my cage, I had the opportunityto listen to some of the ""creative excuses"" offered the judge by others.After listening to a number of ""Well, I was passing a very slow truckthat suddenly speed up"" versions, I decided that the judge had heardjust about every story in the book and then some.  He was less thanimpressed with any of them.This young, rather burley looking guy, had his docket read by arather drill sargent looking Ohio State Highyway Patrol Trooper.He was clocked riding a motorcycle at a speed of 110 mph in a 55 mphzone.  It was also noted that the defendant (motorcycle rider) hadalcohol on his breath, but was not cited for this offence.The judge looked over his half glasses purched on the end of his noseand said in his sternest voice: ""Well son, those are some prettyfast speeds to be riding a motorcycle.  What do you have to say foryour self?""""Well Sir"", meekly the defenant replied, ""I just was over to mybuddys and we had a couple of beers and I was on my way home.""He offered nothing more or less.  Just had a couple of beers andwas doing 110 mph on his way home.The judge moved by the simplicity of the response, fined him themaximum in this case (plus court costs of course) and ordered himto attend remedial drivers training school.Isn't America Great??",18

"Okay... I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women aredifferent ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Muchrecent evidence for this statement is present in the book ""Brainsex"" byAnne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it.Their book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topicand is well referenced. Now, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can onlyadequately take into account their needs in these areas where they aredifferent by also taking into account the ways in which men and womenare different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes intoaccount that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rulesit would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in thisinstance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example ofwhere men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!Now, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression.However, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT. Men do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the sameextent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much aman _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  Andtherefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave,NO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.Maternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because thesexism here just reflects the ""sexism"" of nature in making men and womendifferent.  There are many other differences between men and women whichare far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these Irecommend you have a look at the book ""Brainsex"".Your point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious.If men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologicallybecome women!  To have a womb and the other factors required forpregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is --so your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  Youare saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that women can have if they also become women -- which actually just supportsmy statement that maternity leave is sexist.There is no official priesthood in Islam -- much of this function istaken by Islamic scholars.  There are female Islamic scholars andfemale Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam.  An example fromearly Islamic history is the Prophet's widow, Aisha, who was recognizedin her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar.You have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions, andI dispute it.  I could go on and on about women in Islam, etc., but Irecently reposted something here under the heading ""Islam and Women"" --if it is still at your news-site I suggest you read it.  It is repostedfrom soc.religion.islam, so if it has disappeared from alt.atheism itstill might be in soc.religion.islam (I forgot what its original titlewas though).  I will email it to you if you like. Your statement that ""other religions are no different"" is, I think, astatement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other thanChristianity and perhaps Judaism.Aisha, who I mentioned earlier, was not only an Islamic scholar but alsowas, at one stage, a military leader.The Prophet's first wife, who died just before the ""Hijra"" (theProphet's journey from Mecca to Medina) was a successful businesswoman.Lucio, you cannot make a strong case for your viewpoint when yourviewpoint is based on ignorance about world religions.",0

"------- Blind-Carbon-CopyTo: spacenews@austen.rand.org, cti@austen.rand.orgSubject: White House outlines options for station, Russian cooperationDate: Tue, 06 Apr 93 16:00:21 PDTFrom: Richard Buenneke <buenneke@austen.rand.org>4/06/93:  GIBBONS OUTLINES SPACE STATION REDESIGN GUIDANCENASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C.April 6, 1993RELEASE:  93-64        Dr.  John H.  Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and TechnologyPolicy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on theRedesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidanceto the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the spacestation.        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and ahigh option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Eachoption would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscalyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, researchoperations support, transition cost and also must include adequate programreserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASAbudget for the President's new technology investment.  As a result,station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsettingreductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space stationoption of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASAbudget over the next 5 years.        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session ofthe advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused uponadministrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They alsoreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process theStation Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisorycommittee to consider.        Gibbons also announced that the United States and itsinternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- havedecided, after consultation, to give ""full consideration"" to use ofRussian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in theredesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesignteam can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIRand the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise ofthe Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  Theoverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducingstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achievingthat goal.        Gibbons reiterated that, ""President Clinton is committed to theredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve thescience, the technology and the jobs that the space station programrepresents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is wellmanaged and one that does not consume the national resources which shouldbe used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.""        NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russianparticipation will be accomplished through the East-West Space ScienceCenter at the University of Maryland under the leadership of RoaldSagdeev.",6

"Hi Janet,Sounds exactly like mine.  Same circumstance, same onset symptoms, same cafergot uselessness, same duration.  In fact, of all the peopleI know who have migraines, none have been so similar.  There is sucha wide variation between people with respect to what causes theirheadaches, that I generally don't bother sharing what I've learnedabout mine, but since ours seem to be alike, here are my observations.I don't think it's heat, per se (I've had more in winter than summer).Dehydration could conceivably figure, though.  Try tanking up beforeplaying rather than after.Being in shape doesn't seem to help me much, either.I've identified four factors that do make a difference (listed in descending order of importance):1) Heavy exercise2) Sleep deprivation3) Fasting		(e.g., skipped breakfast)4) Physical trauma	(e.g., head bonk)Heavy exercise has preceded all of my post-adolescent migraines, but I don't get migraines after every heavy exercise session.  One or more of the other factors *must* be present (usually #2).  Since I discovered this, I've been nearly migraine-free -- relapsing only once every two or three years when I get cocky (""It's been so long, maybe I just don't get them anymore"") and stop being careful.Hope this is helpful.",5

I was raised by a pack of wild corn dogs.    We here are *VERY* interested in info on R12 substitutes (in fact I think we really need all the info on this we can get).    I would really appreciate technical, supply, and hardware-upgrade details.     Also, R12 is a useful solvent/reagent in the extraction/production of certain pharmaceuticals.  Any info on the substitutes' corresponding usefullness?    I am currently working with the local engineers who are making sure we are compliant with the regulations.  The trouble with regulations is that they only tell you what you are no longer permitted to do, not what you should do instead.     I think the cause of the new regulations is the Montreal Protocol which has a definite CFC-phase-out schedule.  (Of course the cause of the Montreal Protocol was all the research done on the causes of the Ozone Depletion Problem.)     Someone asked earlier about why the governments were working so fast to ban the ozone-depleting (CFC) chemicals and not gasolines and other greenhouse-gas-producing compounds.  The greenhouse effect (produced by infrared-trapping gasses like CO2 and methane) and the ozone-hole problem (produced by long-lived, chlorine-containing molecules) are not the same thing.  It is a lot easier to do something about not using the CFC's (chloro-fluorocarbons) than it is to stop producing CO2 and methane which are natural byproducts of combustion and of living (animal) organisms. Planting more trees and not destroying so many existing trees would help the greenhouse-gas problem, but would do nothing for the ozone problem. Fred W.
