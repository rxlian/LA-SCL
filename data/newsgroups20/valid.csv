"It depends on the bike. Once you've found a bike you're interested in, callsome insurance companies for rates. Some bikes are much cheaper to insure thanyou might think (my EX-500 only costs me $127/year in St. Louis; I'm 27)For a first bike, I recommend 500cc's or less. And a bike short enough to getboth feet on the ground when you stop. The one piece of advice EVERYONE will give you is to take a Motorcycle SafetyFoundation Rider's Course. See a dealer for details. In some states, completionof such a course can give you a break on insurance. It will also teach youto ride properly from the beginning, so you won't learn any bad habits.Good luck.

": When the object of their belief is said to be perfect and make the believers: act in a certain way and we observe that they don't, we have a contradiction.: Something defined contradictorily cannot exist.

The behavior of believers isa completely separate question from that of God's existence; there isnothing contradictory here.To say that something defined contadictorily cannot exist, is reallyasking too much; you would have existence depend on grammar. All youcan really say is that something is poorly defined, but that in itselfis insufficient to decide anything (other than confusion of course).Your point that there are better reasons for the phenomenon of beliefthan the object of belief may lead to a rat's nest of unnecessarycomplexity.

"Hi, maybe someone can help me here...I am looking to buy this 1990 Nissan Maxima GXE for CDN$14000 right now.The car has 96000 km (or about 60000 miles) on it.A typical mileage for 1990 cars seem to be about 70000 km (or about 43K mi).The seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certificationhe was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replacedto meet the legal standards.  (He said he will replace the components beforeselling the car to me.)Being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars, I don't knowwhat this could mean...Is 96K km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items?Or is this an indication that the car was abused?Would other things break down or have to be replaced soon?The seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot, but,I don't know how to verify this...  I've seen the paint chipped awayin tiny dots in the front edge of the hood, though.Although the Maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean andwell kept, it's currently out of warranty(a similarly priced '90 Accord with 70K km will have 2 years or 30K kmworth of warranty left) and I don't want to worry about paying forany repair bills...But, I also need a car for 5 people...  When will the new Maxima come out, by the way?I would very much appreciate your input in this.Please reply by e-mail (preferred) or post in this newsgroup.Thanks!Ryan",17

"I have a question that is a slight variation on the previously mentionedexamples that perhaps people could give me some pointers on (it has been acouple of years since my Con Law class in college so I hope I am notmissing something obvious here...)Basic Scenario:	I set up a bbs that uses public-key encryption and encryption of	files on disk.  The general setup is designed so that when users 	connect they send a private key encrypted using the system public	key and the user's public-private keypair is used to wrap the	one-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk.  The	result of this is that even if I reveal the system private key it	is impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the	machine.  What is possible is for someone to use the revealed	system private key to entice users into revealing thier personal	private keys during the authentication sequence.Questions:	Does the fact that the system private key does not provide any	information useful for a search give me any protection as far as	being coerced to reveal the key?  (I doubt it myself..)	It seems providing the system private key does not mean that I am	assisting in ""entrapment"" (the users would send thier key anyway	and are not being enticed into doing something they would not	otherwise do) but is there any other hook that can be used?	Would the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval?Any answers or general musings on the subject would be appreciated...jim",3
"[FAQ and Darius' response deleted]I am myself an SDA and I am in total agreement with what Darius has to say.  I also worship on Saturday to honor the Lord.  Your mention of ""[esteeming] all days alike"" IMO has to do with the fast days observed by the Jews.  But no matter how you interpret that passage, I do accept your worship on Sunday as being done in honor of the Lord, in contrast with what many of my fellow SDA believers may believe.  To me, though, the bible overwhelmingly points to Saturday as the day to be kept in honor of creation and of God's deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.  To those who would attempt to point out that my observance of Saturday is being legalistic, this is simply not the case.  Rather, keeping Saturday allows me a full day to rest and contemplate God's goodness and grace.The idea was introduced to me once that the reason Paul wanted the Corinthians to lay aside money for the collection on the first day of the week was because that was when they received their weekly wages.  Paul wanted them to lay aside money for the collection as first priority, before spending their money on other things.  I do not have any proof in front of me for this though, although it would explain why they would lay aside money in their homes instead of a meeting.  It would seem to me that you assume that the christians in the NT regularly worshipped on the first day.  I assume that the christians in the NT regularly worshipped on the seventh day.  But I agree with you that we only have implications because the authors did assume the reader knew when worhip was.",7
"[An article from comp.org.eff.news, EFFector Online 5.06 - Carl]                       April 16, 1993      INITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY                             PROPOSAL       The Clinton Administration today made a major announcement on cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of millions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as export controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to robust encryption as well as law enforcement issues posed by new technology.       However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the National Security Agency. The so-called ""Clipper Chip"" is an 80-bit, split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow agents would store users' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  The encryption scheme used is to be classified, but they chips will be available to any manufacturer for incorporation into their communications products.       This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .       First, the Administration appears to be adopting a solution before conducting an inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper chip may not be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes. Furthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for Clipper or any other chips.  Rather,independent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.       Second, an algorithm can not be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  The public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny.         Third, while the use of the split-key, dual-escrowed system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is adopted.  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys?  Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive individual's fifth amendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?         In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy and security.  However, the ""Clipper chip"" solution ought to be considered as part of the inquiry, not be adopted before the discussion even begins.DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:ESCROWThe 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whom hold 40 bits of each key.  Upon presentation of a valid warrant, the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  Most likely the Attorney General will be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the Administration have suggested one non-law enforcement federal agency, perhaps the Federal Reserve, and one non-governmental organization.  But, there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.Key registration would be done by the manufacturer of the communications device.  A key is tied to the device, not to the person using it.CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORSThe Administration claims that there are no back door means by which the government or others could break the code without securing keys from the escrow agents and that the President will be told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order to prove this, Administration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto cracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine the algorithm for trap doors.  The results of the investigation would then be made public.GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVERIn order to get a market moving, and to show that the government believes in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customers for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, VP Al Gore, and maybe even the President. FROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:Jerry Berman, Executive DirectorDaniel J. Weitzner, Senior Staff Counsel",3

"Firstly, I would never consider trying to make a one-shot timer. Your 2F2 capwill have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use inapplications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Theirperformance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap.The other point is that big electro's are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances,so calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when consideringthe cold).You should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain,that ""rolls over"" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every1,209,600 seconds. If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you wouldneed a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in thefiring times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hzoscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillatorremaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.I would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing thesolenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.Caveat - I'm not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can'tguarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitableconditions.JohnH----------------------------------------------------------------------------      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \/           School of MPCE    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983",4

Your claim that the Lebanese/Syrian Landlords sold Palestine(if true, even partially) omits the fact that the mandatetreaty put Lebanon and Syria under French rule, whilePalestine under british.  Obiviously, any such landlordwould have found himself a foreigner in Palestine and wouldbe motivated to sell, regardless of the price.It is interesting though that you acknowledge that thepalestinians were shafted. Do many Israelis or Jews shareyour opinion ?  Do you  absolve the purchaser fromany ethical commitments just because it wasn't written down? All told, I did not see an answer in your response. Thequestion was whether the intent behind the purchase wasaimed at controlling the public assets (land,infra-structure etc...).

"This a ""tried and true"" method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups:to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace, thus forcing theopposing ""state"" to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or,in order to avoid the deaths of civilians, abandon the search. Certainly thepeople who use the population for cover are *also* to blaim for dragging theinnocent civilians into harm's way.Are you suggesting that, when guerillas use the population for cover, Israelshould totally back down? So...the easiest way to get away with attackinganother is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respectsinnocent lives?Your damn right Israel insists on some sort of ""demilitarized"" or ""buffer""zone. Its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territoryof Arab states and watched as the states did nothing. It is not exactlysurprizing that Israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to do it themselves.What? So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states can start all over again? While I also hope for this to happen, it willonly occur WHEN Arab states show that they are *prepared* to take on the responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their soil. They have to Prove it (or provide some ""guaratees""), there is no wayIsrael is going to accept their ""word""- not with their past attitude of tolerance towards ""anti-Israel guerillas in-residence"".Good lord, Brad. What in the world goves you the idea that UN troops stopanything? They are ONLY stationed in a country because that country allowsthem in. It can ask them to leave *at any time*; as Nasser did in '56 and'67. Somehow, with that ""limitation"" on the troops ""powers"" I don'tthink that Israel is going to be any more comfortable. Without a *genuine* commitment to peace from the Arab states, and concrete (not intellectual or political exercises in jargon) ""guarantees"" by other parties, the UN is worthlessto Israel (but, perhaps useful as a ""ruse""?).Perhaps you are aware that, to most communities of people, there isthe feeling that it is better that ""many of us die fightingagainst those who attack us than for few to die while we silently accept our fate."" If,however, you call on Israel to see the sense of suffering fewer casualties, I suggest you apply the same to Palestinian,Arab and Islamic groups.From Israel's perspective, ""concessions"" gets it NOTHING...except the realization that it has given ""something"" up and now *can only hope* that the other side decides to do likewise. Words *can be takenback* by merely doing so; to ""take back"" tangible items (land,control of land) requires the sort of action you say Israel shouldstay away from. Israel put up with attacks from Arab state territories for decades before essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of Lebanon.The entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above: 1) Israel would express outrage at these attacks and protest to the Arab state involved, 2) that state promptly ignored the entire matter, secure in the knowledge that IT could not be held responsible for the acts committed by ""private groups"", 3) Israel would prepare for the next round of attacks. What would Israel want to return to those days (anddon't be so idiotic as to suggest ""trust"" for the motivations ofpresent-day Arab states)?Ah, ok...what is ""different"" about the present situation that tellsus that the Arab states will *not* pursue their past antagonistic policies towards Israel? Now, don't talk about vague ""political factors""but about those ""tangible"" (just like that which Israel gave up)factors that ""guarantee"" the responsibility of those states. Yourassessment of ""difference"" here is based on a whole lot of assumptions,and most states don't feel confortable basing their existence on thatsort of thing.It has not. Without the support, and active involvement, of Syria,Lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred.Once Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain control? If Syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for Israel.Tim",9

"As the subject suggests the Flames were not impressive this afternoon,dropping a 6-3 decision to the LA Kings. Most of the Flames neglectedto show up, especially in their own zone, as the Kings hit at leastfive posts! The Flames best line was probablySkrudland-Paslawski-Berube (which tells how bad the Flames were). GarySuter scored a great goal (in fact all three Flame goals were scoredby D-men - Yawney and Dahlquist getting the others), but also madesome bonehead plays. For the Kings, Pat Conacher was especiallyimpressive. The games was VERY chippy, as Dan Mirouelli lost control early andnever recovered it; there were high-sticks, cross-checks, punches,hits from behind. Fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out WarrenRychel from behind. Flames dominated the game physically, but failedto take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses (I don't thinkVernon can be blamed for any of the goals). Calgary went with 7 D-men,as Roger Johansson played LW; he looked lost IMHO - I hope Kinginserts Chris Lindbergh, Paul Kruse, or Sergei Makarov for Wednesday'sgame.

"Perhaps you're using the wrong brand! (Sorry all HP fans, but I havea hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their(excellent) gear).One of the principal functions I look for when considering a DSO iswhether you can turn interpolation off. The other important featureis to disable repetitive waveform acquisition i.e. being able to lockthe instrument into real time capture mode.I agree with you here. The only consolation is that manufacturers are_beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus.However, to be fair, it seems that first time scope users (our students)seem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty ormore knobs required of a ""real"" scope :-)This is one area that newer DSOs are addressing. I recently evaluatedthe latest box from Tek - their TDS320 - which seems to be a worthyalternative to a standard 100MHz analogue CRO. This instrument hasa 100MHz, 500Ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real timecapture mode. The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes inthe range. The downer is that the instrument uses menus again, but atleast they appear to be logically laid out.One more thing about the new, ""simpler"", front panels. These instrumentstend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. This is a vast improvementover the old oak switch. The single most common cause of failure in ourscopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on theseswitches. I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing thelongevity of the instruments.JohnH----------------------------------------------------------------------------      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \/           School of MPCE    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983",4

"[Deletions]Geez, Dal must have slipped something into Ted's drink sometime.  ComparingPrince to Pagnozzi offensively is laughable.  Prince has never hit well inthe minors and he's now 27 years old, I think.  Pagnozzi was not a bad hitterin the minors.  (I'll bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming I don't haveanother brain cramp and forget.)  He had a very good year at Louisville before coming up to the majors.  As I recall, the hype on Pagnozzi coming upin the organization was good hit, decent fielding.  When he got to the majors and didn't hit as well as expected (not as much playing time?), he became Exhibit 312 in Nichols' Law of Catcher Defense and got the reputation as an outstanding defensive catcher.  It's not clear he ever learned tohit.

If Ted is going to invoke Pagnozzi as a model for Prince,given that Prince has underperformed Pagnozzi in the minors, it's nota rosy picture.BTW, I'm still unhappy with moving Zeile, who had the same reputation coming up in the Cardinal organization as Pagnozzi, except that he wasa much, much better hitter, to 3rd where he could be an average hitterand a below average fielder instead of a well-above average hitteras an average (or below average) fielding catcher.Harold",19

"It should have been made fairly clear that the *most* Crimson wouldever get was a 150 (75 old style) MHz CPU upgrade.  Certainly thiswas mentioned on comp.sys.sgi on more than one occasion as beinglikely.  If our sales folks were saying otherwise, they were eitherconfused, or less than honest/ethical, or somebody further up thechain inside SGI was misleading them.There were 4 versions (20, 25, 30, 35), although admittedly the 30 cameout at the same time as the 35, over a period of 2 1/2 years.  Thechassis simply couldn't be pushed any further.  I'd say 4 years wasa pretty good lifespan, myself, for a system design in this day andage.  Getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both thehardware and product design groups; we would have been out of ourminds to push it further, and I *know* that was made clear, almostfrom the day the 35 started shipping.  We had one last kicker inthe form of the Elan graphics, which made 3 graphics versions overits lifespan, which I also think is pretty good.Please, by all means send a complaint letter through SGI supportor sales on your concerns.  There should be no reason for sales folksto misrepresent future upgrades to customers (sure, sometimes therewill be confusion for a while, over whether an upgrade will be available,but that shouldn't last too long, and doesn't seem to be what youare referring to).Yes, the sales folks *do* get bonus's at the end of some (all?) quarters,but that is pretty common industry wide, and sometimes that can resultin good deals for customers (sometimes it probably pushes folks intosystems that aren't what they need, I'm sure, but nobody is *forcing*you to buy at end of quarter, after all...)They don't get all that long a lead time either; although certainlythey get presentations on possible new products, and their opinionsmay well influence the end product, but that also is life in theindustry.  We can't design systems that meet just their needs, or wewon't sell too many systems, after all (which is not to say that wedon't have some niche products, like Reality Engine).But surely you don't expect a system you buy now for a five yearperiod to be constantly upgradable over that entire five yearperiod?

"For those of you who are thinking about fiamms, you might also want to thinkabout airhorns. I just installed a set of Bosch air horns ordered from Dennis Kirk (pg. 282 of the latest catalog) on my '85 FJ1100. They are ratedat 93db at 7 meters. I installed them using 10 gage wire from the battery tothe relay to the compressor to ground. My stock horn connectors fit the relaypins just fine. I soldered the connections to the relay and compressor, and useda crimp type battery connector and an inline 10amp fuse/connector from NAPA.	I installed the compressor just forward of the fuse box in the frontfairing by tie wrapping between the steering head frame and the black steel tubeframe used to support the front fairing. You have to remove the front fairing todo this, but it fits outside of the frame but inside the fairing on the twovertical supports just in front of the fuses. Depending how tight your fairingfollows the frame, you should be able to fit it somewhere in the fairing.The compressor is about 2"" in diameter and about 5"" long.	The relay mounted on the front of the steering head frame (it is smallso there should be plenty of good places for it.	I found a perfect place for the horns that required only tie wraps tomount. The horns fit inside the front fairing/frame and stick out on either sidejust in front of the air scoops, but behind the turn signals. The back of thehorns point back towards the center of the bike and come real close to wherethe gas tank connects to the front part of the frame. There is just enoughroom to the outside to allow full lock to lock clearance, and there are nicecut outs in the frame for the back of the horn to go into.	The short horn is even with the fairing, and the long one sticks outabout an inch or so, but it is really not that noticable unless you lookclosely. They end up pointing down slightly and maybe 30 degrees from straightahead (perfect for those cagers trying to change lanes into you).	If you have any other questions about the mounting, email, and I can tryto explain better. If your bike is not red, then you may want to paint themfirst.	How do they work you ask? They are very, very, very *LOUD*. They soundmore like a european sports car than a truck, but a vast improvement over stock.I have used them at least daily since installing them, and the 10 amp fuse hasnot blown yet (although, the duration of the horn blasts have been short).	I've repeatedly scared the shit out of my friends with them, even thoughthey know that I have the horns, they still jump. They are perfect for keepingthe pedestrians on the sidewalk.The bottom line is they work, are loud enough to cause pain and suffering tothose stupid lane changing cages (as well as take a few years off their lives)and are relatively easy to install on the FJ.

" It's the ""opening-game effect"" maybe. Pros arrive late, nervousness for rookie WC players, and problems to get the lines clicking may make things hard to get it going against these ""worse"" nations. I'd guess that the better team you face in the opening game, the better it is, since the chances of an upset are greater then. Some other reasons why the ""worse"" teams are so tough to beat was presented by Hans ""Virus"" Lindberg (former coach in Switzerland). 1) The ""worse"" teams (referring to France, Switzerland, Austria, Italy etc)    have now usually world class goalies. 2) Their defensive play have become much more disciplined, they take much    less unnecessary penalties. 3) They use four lines which makes it harder to make them ""run out of gas."" 4) The ice quality in the German WC rinks is poor.

"                         ^^^^^^^ Militia                  ^^^^^ State        ^^^^ ArmsYou didn't even get the capitalization correct!  Try reading USCA onthe Constitution, or get any other CORRECT version of theConstitution. Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!!    James Madison, Federalist Paper 46: ""Besides the advantage of    being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost    every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to    which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers    are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of    ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government    of any form can admit of.  Notwithstanding the military    establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are    carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments    are afraid to trust the people with arms.""                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434, 8 June 1789: ""The right    of the people to keep and bear... arms shall not be infringed.  A    well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people,                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free    country...""    Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (on the organization of    the militia): ""Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with    respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it    will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of    a year.""    Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (speaking of standing    armies): ""... if circumstances should at any time oblige the    government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be    formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large    body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*****    own rights and those of their fellow-citizens.""    ***^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^But *surely* Hamilton and Madison didn't mean the PEOPLE when theysaid ""people"", right?  That's why the Amendment refers to ""the Rightof the Militia""?...  ;-)You're right, the Militia consists of ALL able bodied males (andprobably females under current interpretation). The Amendment does nor refer to ""well organized"", it says ""wellregulated"".  I have some targets you may examine if you wish to checkhow _well regulated_ I am. Correct.  That's why the Right is reserved to the People.  And thatwas to insure the People could form a ""well regulated Militia"", not a""well organized militia"".What do Atomic Units have to do with this argument?  Any moron can seth_bar = C = 1...Oh, I see what your question is; Why don't you read the federalistPapers?!     James Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the ""General    Welfare"" clause): ""Nothing is more natural nor common than first    to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a    recital of particulars.""But what does Madison know about the grammatical style of the 2nd?  Heonly wrote it.That's obviously because you've never actually *read* the FederalistPapers. Can't read, huh?  Show me where the document says ""well organizedmilitia"". That is *exactly* why EVERY PERSON should be allowed to own *any*weapon currently in use in the armed forces.But the major reason is to protect against that very same army.    Abraham Lincoln, First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1861: ""This    country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit    it.  Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government,    they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it, or    their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it.""    Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, spoken during floor debate    over the Second Amendment, I Annals of Congress at 750, 17 August    1789: ""What, Sir, is the use of a militia?  It is to prevent the    establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty. ...    Whenever Governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of    the people, they always attempt to destroy the militia, in order    to raise an army upon their ruins.""So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroyour Liberties and Rights.--Charles Scripter   *   cescript@phy.mtu.eduDept of Physics, Michigan Tech, Houghton, MI 49931",8

"Hello Netlanders:       I am a novice X user with a question for any Xgod.       My computer configuration with the X problem is as follows:       486DX50/256/16RAM  running Esix 4.0.4        Wangtek AT-style interface 250 M tape drive.       I have loaded the Basic OS (which includes nsu) and       inet utilities (tcp/ip).       I ftp-ed the XFree86 (X11R5) binaries and installed properly.  I can execute startx and run X-windows with no problems. However, if I try to access the tape drive while in X, the machine locks up instantly.  If I am out of X and access the tape, the tape drive works fine.  Soon as I try to startx again; the screen changes modes, but, the grey background pattern does not come up and no xterm is forked.  I have to login from another terminal and execute a shutdown to reset the system. I've contacted Esix about this problem.  They claim THEIR X-window X11R4 server (which I have) works with the Wangtek tape drive.  They also  claim I only need the nsu (network system utilities) to run X; I don't need inet (tcp/ip).  My experience has been that I need BOTH to get XFree86 to work.  I'm not too concerned about having to load both nsu and inet packages to get X to work unless the inet package is causing my problem. I would like to get both X and my tape drive to co-exist on the same system.  If you can shed any light on the problem, it would be appreciated.  One colleague implied this might be a hardware conflict.  If this is true, what direction should I look to resolve the conflict ? Thanks,",15

In short, virtuallyevery board manufacturer cheats on the test by writing things in thedriver that is there only to make the board appear faster on theWinBench suite.  So the WinBench score has no bearing in reality tohow cards stack up on real world tasks.In the last PC-Magazine they benchmarked some of the new accelerators,and admitted that many of them 'cheated' on WinBench.  Interestingly,they 'allowed' one type of cheating behaviour (caching for bitbltoperations, no matter how unreal), yet did not allow a couple of othertypes of cheating behaviour that some of the cards used.

"	Serum, actually, but plasma numbers are the same.  Whole blood	numbers for humans tend to be somewhat lower (roughly 5 to 10 	percent lower).  I find the following range for whole blood in	FUNDAMENTALS OF CLINICAL CHEMISTRY: N. W. Teitz, editor; W. B.	Saunders, 1987:	Human glucose (whole blood, fasting levels) --> 60 - 95 mg./dL.	Indeed, they do measure whole blood levels, although they are not	as accurate as a serum test done in a laboratory.  One problem is	that cells in the sample continue to metabolize glucose after the	sample is drawn, reducing the apparent level.  According to Teitz,	however, results compare ""reasonably well"" with laboratory results,	although ""values below 80 mg./dL. tend to be lower with strip tests,	whereas values above 240 mg./dL. can be very erratic.""	As stated above, whole blood levels tend to be roughly 5 to 10 	percent lower than serum levels.  Sample freshness will affect	whole blood levels, however.  I don't believe there is a well-	defined ""conversion factor,"" since cell metabolism will affect	samples to varying degrees.

"Joe,     As usual, this issue of dysfunction, of bad values, of messed up culture is easily embraced by non african americans when it comes to explainingproblems in our community. From your post, you apparently find the idea thatsomething is wrong with African Americans, value-wise, culture wise orsomething, very appealing. I never cease to be amazed at how eager non africanamericans are to embrace theories about our problems which basically assertthat something is wrong with us. The socio-economic factors which we know help to produce high crime levels, like poverty, which exists among us in large proportion, I mean when it comes to discussion of african american problems, wesomehow become exempt from all these types of factors, and the problem is laid at the doorstep of some neboulous dysfunction we supposedly have. But nobody attributes crime amongst white americans to dysfunction. No, that has socioeconomic factors to it, but for africa americans, its gotta be a dysfunction.Basically, I think this tendency for non african americans to believe thatsomething is wrong with us exists because non african americans don't want todeal with the possiblility that the society is deeply biased against africanamericans, and that this is about 80% of the problem. It could not possible bethat the society is so deeply racist and structured against us, that this hasa very effective negative effect on us. No, something is wrong with us.Non african americans are quick to disregard what we have to say, because they are so busy trying to find something wrong with us, instead of taking a good hard look at the thing we say are doing us damage.

For example, incorrectEnglish constructs such as ""its raining"" or ""it's window id"" annoy me.However, there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the waythings really are in the world. Indeed, the fact that X won out over NeWSwas really down to popular opinion (I know, we all think it's(!) technicallysuperior as well!).On a related topic, who is to say that ""color"" is more or less correctthan ""colour"" - being Irish, and hence using English English as opposedto American English, I always use the latter except, of course, for APIterms such as ""XAllocColor"" and ""colormap"".In a world that uses the term ""Windows"" to refer to Microsoft Windows,perhaps the time has come to accept ""X Windows"" as a valid term for X.I think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than, say,""the X Window System"" and, let's face it, almost everyone uses it.Ultimately, we all need product sales to more than just X-literatepeople. In this respect, product recognition is important and a short,snappy, descriptive title (""X"" is positively obscure) will helpwhen dealing with the average punter (it's sad - I thought I was asoftware engineer!).

"Here is a press release from the White House. Remarks by President Clinton to NCAA Division I Champion Hockey TeamApril 19; Q&A Following To: National Desk Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100   WASHINGTON, April 19 -- Following is a transcriptof remarks by President Clinton to the University of Maine ""BlackBears"" NCAA Division I hockey champions:                           The Rose Garden 9:58 A.M. EDT     THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It'san honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, thewinner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to theRose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchellthat this is the first team from the University of Maine every to wina national championship.  And we're glad to have them here.     I'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together towin the championship, but how the entire state pulled together tocheer them onto victory.     Coming from a state that is also relatively small insize, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I canunderstand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears.In our state people are still talking about the time we won theOrange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that wasback in 1978.  I'm sure that 15 years from now, the people of Mainewill as proud of this team as they are today.     You know, in my state football is a slightly morepopular sport than hockey.  We don't have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.)But after spending three months getting banged around in this town, Ican understand a little more about hockey than I did before I camehere.  Hockey is a tough game.  It's a hard-hitting sport.  It doeshave one virtue though, there's a penalty for delay of game.  I wishwe had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)     In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  Inthe United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the MajorityLeader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; juniorSenator -- Cohen looks so young, I can't imagine.  (Laughter.)  I'mactually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much youngerthan me.     On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has donea great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championshipgame, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else Iknow a little bit about.     Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teamsand in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell andSenator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Mainemust feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as ateam, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come frombehind.     I think it's important, as I ask young people fromaround America who have achieved outstanding things in workingtogether, to come here to the White House to be recognized andappreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of valuesand those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for allof our lives.     We now have another role model, and I'm glad to havethem here today.  (Applause.)     (The President is presented with team jersey.)(Applause.)     THE PRESIDENT:  That's great.  I love it.  It's beautiful.(Applause.)     (The President is presented with an autographed stick.)     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That's great.  (Applause.)                             * * * * * *     Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Wacothis morning, sir?     THE PRESIDENT:  I was aware of it.  I think the AttorneyGeneral made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questionsto her and to the FBI.     Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how itshould be executed?     THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions.That was their judgment, the FBI.     Q  Is this a raid?     THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to --talk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to bedone, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tacticaldecisions.     Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about thismorning?     Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?     THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay myquarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).     SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.     THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  SenatorMitchell, he's worth a quarter any day.     Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?     THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happenthis week in the Senate and about what other meetings we're going tohave for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes totalk.  And we agreed we'd get back together later, around noon, andtalk some more.     Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that yourcompromise is no compromise.     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, SenatorDole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted forthe same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our researchindicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28emergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reaganand Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of thosepurposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American peopleback to work.  I don't want to go back and revisit every one, but youcan do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this positionthey're taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-yeardeficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that timeand then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all gotto be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base theirposition.  They've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of thiskind that had very little to with putting the American people back towork.  So I think we've got a chance to work it out, and I'm hopeful.We'll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I'm feeling pretty goodabout it.     THE PRESS:  Thank you                                 END       10:10 A.M. EDT -30-",2

"Apparently, Part 2 (defensemen numbered 2 through 19) was lost when I postedit; to make things worse, I lost my own copy.

If someone responds, I will repost it when I get it; otherwise, I willre-write it in a day or two and post it.  Sorry about that.#8	LARRY DEPALMA		Season:	3rdAcquired:	'91-92, free agent from MinnesotaGrade:		I (C-/D+)No netter/fan watching the Sharks, including me, knows where DePalma was atthe end of the season; the Sharks appeared to still have his rights, but hewasn't in San Jose, he wasn't in Kansas City, and his name hasn't appeared onthe waiver wire.  And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most partfor DePalma.  After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning,DePalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing gooddefense.  Unfortunately, the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest ofthe way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally lookedlethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  He then was sent down toKansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstatedwhen it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared fromthe watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharksofficials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.#10	JOHAN GARPENLOV		Season: 3rdAcquired:	'91-92, trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round		pick in '92 entry draft from VancouverGrade:		A/A-After an early slump, Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the restof the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on theteam, as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing RobGaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit, but Garpenlov, finishing second inthe MVP voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as hewas seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to himby putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power-play goals.  Contrary to his previous rep, Garpenlov also showed that despitehis small size (5' 11"", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself aroundwhen necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to workon his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, andwas actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He willbe a major key to the offense next year.#15	DAVID BRUCE		Season: 5thAcquired:	'91-92, from St. Louis in expansion draftGrade:		I (?)After a banner '91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) andwas third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was botheredvirtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of thelineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult tospeculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected bythe injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a manshort in the Sharks' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensiveleader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame,because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, hisfuture with the Sharks next season appears clouded.#18	MARK PEDERSON		Season:	3rdAcquired:	'92-93, trade with Philadelphia for C/LW Dave SnuggerudGrade:		I (B)It is difficult for me to understand the Flyers' decision to unload Pederson,after a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), butafter riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to theSharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited byinjuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But whenhealthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size(and the willingness to throw it around, although he's not considered aphysical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liabilityon defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see howmuch, exactly, Pederson can do.#20	JOHN CARTER		Season: 4thAcquired:	'91-92, free agent from BostonGrade:		I (B+/B)Carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hardwork worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although hedid look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55games) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work cando, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, alwayshussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensivezone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end,but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impressoffensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  Heis very unlikely to be back next season.#28	JEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN	Season: 1stAcquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draftGrade:		I (B+/B)I don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creatingopportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHLduty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in trainingcamp before the '91-92 season limited Quintin, the team's leading scorer inexhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with theSharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be asolid contender for regular duty next season.#41	MARK BEAUFAIT		Season: 1stAcquired:	2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draftGrade:		I (?)After a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with theSharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and theSharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his onlyNHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5' 9"", 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shyto throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times,although it's too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he playedmostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan andKansas City.#42	JAROSLAV OTEVREL	Season: 1stAcquired:	8th round pick in 1991 entry draftGrade:		I (?)Like Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he wasup for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generallyvery much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either,although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once hisdefense is acceptable, he should be ready.#44	MICHEL PICARD		Season: 1stAcquired:	'92-93, trade with Hartford for LW Yvon CorriveauGrade:		I (B-/C+)The 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems tobe close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by theSharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals forhis only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City.He was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensivebrilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, althoughhe has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks' bait in theexpansion draft.#45	DODY WOOD		Season: 1stAcquired:	3rd round pick in 1991 entry draftGrade:		I (D+/D, although perhaps I shouldn't give a grade at all)I have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then, it is probablyno surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, wasnot particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losingmany fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games,projecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  He's not ready, and needs atleast another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, ifnothing else.  His relatively small size (5' 11"", 181 lbs.) does not give muchpossibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer.",2

"(Soner Yamen) responded to article <1r20kr$m9q@nic.umass.edu> BURAK@UCSVAX.[AFS]     Just a quick comment::[AFS][AFS]     Armenians killed Turks------Turks killed Armenians.[AFS][AFS]     Simple as that. Can anybody deny these facts?Jews killed Germans in WWII -- Germans killed Jews in WWII, BUT there was quite a difference in these two statements, regardless of what Nazi revisionists say![SY] My grand parents were living partly in todays Armenia and partly in[SY] todays Georgia. There were villages, Kurd/Turk (different Turkic groups)[SY] Georgian (muslim/christian) Armenian and Farsi... Very near to eachother.[SY] The people living there were aware of their differences. They were [SY] different people. For example, my grandfather would not have been happy [SY] if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian guy. But that did not [SY] mean that they were willing to kill eachother. No! They were neighbors.OK.[SY] Armenians killed Turks. Which Armenians? Their neoghbors? As far as my[SY] grandparents are concerned, the Armenians attacked first but these [SY] Armenians were not their neighbors. They came from other places. Maybe [SY] first they had a training at some place. They were taught to kill people,[SY] to hate Turks/Kurds? It seems so...There is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of theArmenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915, with that of the Armeno-Georgian conflicts of late 1918! The argument is not whether Armenians ever killed in their collective existence, but rather the wholesale destruction ofAnatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government. An Armenian-Georgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak, Lori, and Pambak afterthe Turkish Third Army evacuated the region, cannot be equated with theextermination of Anatolian Armenians. Many Armenians and Georgians diedin this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack ofpreparation for the winter months. This is not the same as the Turkish genocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier, hundreds of kilometersaway![SY] Anyway, but after they killed/raped/... Turks and other muslim people[SY] around, people assumed that 'Armenians killed us, raped our women',[SY] not a particular group of people trained in some camps, maybe backed[SY] by some powerful states... After that step, you cannot explain these [SY] people not to hate all Armenians. I don't follow, perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light.[SY] So what am I trying to point out? First, at least for that region,[SY] you cannot blame Turks/Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation.[SY] Most of the Armenians, I think, are not to blame either. But since some[SY] people started that fire, it is not easy to undo it. There are facts.[SY] People cannot trust eachother easily. It is very difficult to establish[SY] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with[SY] different ethnic/cultural/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately[SY] very easy to start a fire!Again, the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918/19 had little todo with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey. It is interesting thatthe Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia) made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through Tiflis on their way to Baku, in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians militarily. Of course, as Turkish troops marched across what was left ofCaucasian Armenia, many Armenians went north and such population movement caused problems with the locals. This is in no comparison with events 4 years earlier in eastern Anatolia. My father's mother's family escaped Cemiskezek -> Erzinka -> Erzerum -> Nakhitchevan -> Tiflis -> Constantinople -> Massachusetts. [SY] My grandparents were *not* bloodthirsty people. We did not experience[SY] what they had to endure... They had to leave their lands, there were[SY] ladies, old ladies, all of her children killed while she forced to[SY] witness! Young women put dirt at their face to make themselves[SY] unattractive! I don't want to go into any graphic detail.My grandmother's brother was forced to dress up as a Kurdish women, and pastepotato skins on his face to look ugly. The Turks would kill any Armenianyoung man on sight in Dersim. Because their family was rather influential,local Kurds helped them escape before it was too late.

"Here is a different viewpoint.In practice there is little difference in quality but more care is needed with inkjet because smudges etc. can happen.A cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of that how long does the _first_ sheet take to print? Inkjets are faster than you say and in both cases the computer often has trouble keeping up with the printer. (I have a 486/33 and a lot of drivers cannot keep up with the printer)A sage said to me: ""Do you want one copy or lots of copies?"", ""One"", ""Inkjet"". Paper cost is the same and both can use refills. Long term the laserprinter will need some expensive replacement parts (consumables) and on top of that are the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer.HP inkjets understand PCL so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the software package has no inkjet driver. There is one wild difference between the two printers: a laserprinter is a page printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer. This means that a laserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet cannot. Few drivers actually use this facility.(there is also the matter of downloadable fonts and so on)",4

"Purists often distinguish between ""true"" clubbing and ""pseudo""clubbing, the difference being that with ""true"" clubbing theangle of the nail when viewed from the side is constantlynegative when proceeding distally (towards the fingertip).With ""pseudo"" clubbing, the angle is initially positive, thennegative, which is the normal situation. ""Real"" internistscan talk for hours about clubbing. I'm limited to a coupleof minutes.Whether this distinction has anything to do with reality isentirely unclear, but it is one of those things that internistslove to paw over during rounds. Supposedly, only ""true"" clubbingis associated with disease. The problem is that the list ofdiseases associated with clubbing is quite long, and includesboth congenital conditions and acquired disease. Since many ofthese diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problemsleading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia, it isvery reasonable to get a chest xray. However, many of the congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiaccatheterization. The cause of clubbing is unclear, but presumably relates tosome factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip todilate abnormally. Clubbing is one of those things from an examination which isa tipoff to do more extensive examination. Often, however,the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent.",5

While the United States and 48 of the fifty states call their   highest court ""Supreme Court,"" ""Supreme Judicial Court"" or ""Supreme   Court of Appeals,"" Maryland and New York call theirs simply the   ""Court of Appeals.""  To make matters worse, New York also calls its   _second-highest_ court the ""Supreme Court, Appellate Division""...Atlantic Cement Co._, 26 N.Y.2d 219, 257 N.E.2d 870 (1970)):Oscar H. Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company'splant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as towhich came first, the plaintiff's acquisition of the land or hedefendant's start of production at their cement plant.)  In the courseof its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to theplaintiffs' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from theplant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they askedthe court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.(Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al ownedtheir property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it.Atlantic Cement's actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)Instead of granting the plaintiffs' request for an injunction, the courtordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, providedthat Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  Inother words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, thepower and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoymentof their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain isalways problematical even when it's done by the state; allowing aprivate firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.(Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn't call it eminent domain.  But ifit walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quackslike eminent domain...)Let me take issue with the way you've presented the case... you say that""What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn't allow theplaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-milliondollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages.""  Blackmail?    (Pulls out Black's Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....    ""Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to    do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose    disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under    extortion statutes."")How do you define as ""blackmail"" one party's act of demanding the rightto set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it ownsand which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or ofdemanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I seeit, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position ofowning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted tostay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever pricethey wanted.  There isn't, or at least shouldn't be, any law that saysthat you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.You go on to say: ""The plant would never have been shut down -- theplaintiff's lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement,because the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K tohaving the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount lessthan the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation.""If so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in thebusiness of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements fromother parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by thoseother parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn't want to have to face a choicebetween paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well,shouldn't Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_business?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_the parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that wasAtlantic Cement's own fault for choosing to build and operate the typeof plant they did where and when they did.)And then you say: ""Everyone's property rights were protected; theplaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided.""As above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were ""made whole.""They were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as ownersof property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a priceacceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ madewhole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in thebusiness of ensuring that ""unnecessary"" settlement costs are avoided?(If so, I've been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts weresupposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)(1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as ""infamous,"" at least not at myschool.(Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring fortheir first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I firstencountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personalopinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.  When the students getinto their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pickand choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory ProfessionalResponsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldlyand self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciouslyintimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openlybiased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructorstend to be more open in expressing their own opinions.  This isespecially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, arepracticing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_educational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhatcloistered scholar.  End of aside.)I called it infamous because that's my opinion of it.  For the reasonsI've stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I canonly call ""economic correctness"" over justice.(2) It is ""completely sensible"" only if you believe that the allegedright of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoidlosing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, andthe alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees tonot have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people whoown property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement's wrongful acts.(And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any otherbranch of government) to grant to private parties the right to takeother people's property by eminent domain.)Really?  I didn't know that... what, if anything, has he had to sayabout cases like _Boomer_?I've admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred toas ""law and economics"" is weak.  If it advocates the use of economicalanalysis as one of many ""tie-breaker"" factors which courts may use tohelp them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute, as measured bythe scale of ""justice"", is evenly balanced, fine.  But as illustrated by_Boomer_, it is _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economicsof a case as being more important than the justice of a case.",10

": :    Oh yeah, I just read in another newsgroup that the T560i uses a:    high quality Trinitron tube than is in most monitors.(the Sony:    1604S for example) and this is where the extra cost comes from.  It:    is also where the high bandwidth comes from, and the fantastic:    image, and the large image size, etc, etc...: : It's also where the two annoying lines across the screen (one a third: down, the other two thirds down) come from.: The 2 lines are not a result of the high end trinitron tube, these2 wires will be found on all 17"" trinitron tubes (e.g., Mitsubishi 17"",Sony 1604, etc).  On 14"" Sony tubes, you'll find one wire.Their level of annoyance is purely subjective.  I'm so happy with thesharpness of the T560i that I don't even notice the lines.The T560i uses a Trinitron SA tube which, when viewed as a complete tube,has a larger diameter than the standard Trinitron tube.  This results in a flatter screen than other 17"" monitors using the standard trinitron (which has a vertically flat but not horizontally flat surface), and apparently the ability to provide a tighter beam focus.

Rather than use technology to accommodatethe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy andlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government againstindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years toprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used toprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryptiontechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and theunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be usedby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the ""Clipper Chip"" hasbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents anew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached toan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communicationsusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many incommercial use today.This new technology will help companies protect proprietaryinformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversationsand prevent unauthorized release of data transmittedelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves theability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies tointercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. A ""key-escrow"" system will be established to ensure that the""Clipper Chip"" is used to protect the privacy of law-abidingAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique                                2""keys,"" numbers that will be needed by authorized governmentagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When thedevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separatelyin two ""key-escrow"" data bases that will be established by theAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited togovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct awiretap.The ""Clipper Chip"" technology provides law enforcement with nonew authorities to access the content of the privateconversations of Americans.To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, theAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the newdevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside thegovernment will be offered access to the confidential details ofthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly reporttheir findings.The chip is an important step in addressing the problem ofencryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect theprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shieldcriminals and terrorists.  We need the ""Clipper Chip"" and otherapproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with accessto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using itto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technologytrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),the President has directed government agencies to develop acomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone          calls and data, under proper court or other legal          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern          technology to build the National Information          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and          the competitiveness of American industry in the global          marketplace; and      --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export          high technology products.The President has directed early and frequent consultations withaffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate theprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.                                3The Administration is committed to working with the privatesector to spur the development of a National InformationInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computertechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access toinformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks(""information superhighways"") will transmit video, images, HDTVprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephonesystem transmits voice.Since encryption technology will play an increasingly importantrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must actquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regardingits use.  The Administration is committed to policies thatprotect all Americans' right to privacy while also protectingthem from those who break the law.Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the newencryption technology are also available.

What would they have to do to     decipher the message?A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They     would then present documentation of this authorization to     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key     escrow system.Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will     oversee the key-escrow data banks.Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure     how strong the security is?  A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all     potential users that there are no unrecognized     vulnerabilities.Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet     officials.Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the     decisions related to this initiative.Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?A:   The government designed and developed the key access     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip     manufacturer that produces them.Q:   Who provides the ""Clipper Chip""?A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed     to other vendors in the future.Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating     the ""Clipper Chip"" into their devices.     Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more     powerful encryption devices?A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive     than others readily available today, but it is just one     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to     encryption technology, which the Administration is     developing.     The Administration is not saying, ""since encryption     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,     we will prohibit it outright"" (as some countries have     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that ""every     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an     unbreakable commercial encryption product.""  There is a     false ""tension"" created in the assessment that this issue is     an ""either-or"" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,     balanced approach such as is proposed with the ""Clipper     Chip"" and similar encryption techniques.Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton     Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from     that of the Bush Administration?  A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption     technology in telecommunications and computing and are     committed to working with industry and public-interest     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime     and terrorism.Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use     the government hardware?A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability     of these products.----------- End included article ----------- ",3

"In <Apr.10.05.30.16.1993.14313@athos.rutgers.edu>[ . . . ]Having lived through the kicking and screaming in the 60s and 70s as theCatholics were invited to participate in the liturgy instead of countingtheir rosary beads during Mass, I find this comment interesting.  Thereis a _massively_ longer tradition for proclaiming the Passion accountswithout active participation.  If you know the Latin, one reallybeautiful way to hear the Passion is it's being chanted by threedeacons:  the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range, Jesus chantsin the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor.This is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the Passionthat John would prefer.But there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations.Each pastor makes his own decisions (it isn't a church-wide conspiracyagainst participation).  The Palm Sunday liturgy, with its initialblessing and distribution of the palms and procession, is alreadygetting long before you get to the Passion; some pastors feel that theyshould not make the people stand through that long narrative.  Also, theorchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participationin the crowd quotations runs longer than the single-reader proclamation--- in churches with multiple Masses for the Sunday, it might benecessary to go with the briefer options just to ""get 'em in and get 'emout"".Each parish is different.  Catholics are no longer canonically tied totheir geographic parishes.  It is possible that another Catholic parishin the Columbus area (based on the Ohio State address) has a liturgycloser to your preferences.  Or talk to some of your fellowparishioners and see how common your preferences are --- pastorsgenerally ARE willing to listen to non-confrontational requests.  Thoughyou probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too stronglyto the shock of people asked for a _longer_ Sunday Mass.Perhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasn't followthe continuous evolution model (the accumulation of small changes, nosingle one of which is too hard to take) but rather the punctuatedequilibrium model (things stay the same and we get accustomed to them,then the marked mutation hits).  {My apologies if I am mis-rememberingthe names of the evolutionary theories.}",7

"Dear Folks:It's a pleasure to be able to announce the release of a new freeware program, Xavier, an audio and video  extension to InterViews.Xavier(eXtension AV class for IntERviews) is a C++ class librarythat adds multimedia capability to InterViews.

Currently, the Xavier audio classes are only supported on SUNworkstations with an audio interface, such as the SPARCstation2.Xavier has been tested in the following environments:SUN:  Machine : SPARCserver470 SPARCstation-IPC  OS      : SUN-OS4.1.1 or later  C++     : SUN C++ ver2.1NEC(EWS):  Machine : EWS4800/210,230  OS      : EWS-UX/V(Rel4.0) WSOS41 Release5.1,Release5.2  C++     : C++ Release3.1It can be obtained via anonymous ftp from          interviews.stanford.edu in /pub/contrib/          (Xavier.large-demo.tar, and Xavier.tar)We are preparing a mailing-list for information regarding Xavier.If you are interested, please contact                                  xavier@tsl.cl.nec.co.jp.

"One rule of thumb is that if a person is making the claim, they arewrong.  I was just reading John 14 this morning (I think that is theright chapter, anyway it is close and I don't have a Bible at work tocheck with.) and in it Jesus is talking to his disciples about hisimpending death and he says that he will be going away and then laterhe will be with them.  He said something along the lines of ""I willbe in you and you will be in me.""  (Again I cannot provide the exactquote or citation.)  Anyway, my understanding of this is thatthe Second Coming will not be an outward event.  It is an inwardevent, Christ will come to live in our hearts and we will live in him.If you look for a person you will be deceived.It seems to me that the Jews had been looking for a Messiah that wouldbe a political or military leader and so didn't recognize Jesus whenhe came.  Jesus tried to show that his Kingdom was not of this earth.A lot of what I have seen written about the Second Coming seems tobased on an expectation of Christ coming back and finally taking overthe world and running it the way it should be.  It sounds a lot likewhat the Jews were looking for.  The First Coming wasn't like that andI see no reason for the Second Coming to be like that either.Oh and by the way, I don't expect it to happen once.  There is no oneSecond Coming, there are a lot of little ones.  Every time Christcomes into someones heart, Christ has come again.Peace,Will.---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ",7

"True in theory.  In practice?  The technology of cellular phones willprobably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttextwithout the key.  If the frequency path depends on they key, as Iunderstand it to, it *could* be made effectively impossible to record.Once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access.  Thetelco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant.  That's the ruletoday.But even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless thejudge so ordered.  I think that even interception of the crypttextwithout a warrant would be illegal.   Cops can't record today's plaincellular calls and then ask a judge, ""Hey, can we have permission tolisten to those tapes?"" can they?Yes, that is a major concern, but I think that they think they canwin just by having 99.5% of the USA use this system.

"Actually, this part was really interesting.  It turns out that the mask iscustom-fit to the goalie's face.  The goalie puts his/her face through apiece of wood (or was it plastic?) with a hole in it that allows only the faceand forehead to show.  Hair is covered by a cap, eyes are covered by a plasticwrap-type material, and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face.  Then, aplaster is spread on their cheeks, forehead, and chin which takes about 12minutes to dry sufficiently.  When it dries, it is effectively a mold of thegoalie's face.  This is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involvespadding the inside, hardening the exterior, fitting the cage, etc. etc.  John Blue of the Bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show.

"[deleted][]       And as far as fully-automatic weapons, you can be a lot better[]armed if you want to hit what you aim at.[]Define ""armed better"". Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like theColt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from whichfaster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the otherguys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompsonin hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it's M-16 now to3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troopslike to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (somethingoften in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).A revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.- A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull  the trigger again.- A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,  but will fire merely by pulling the trigger.- A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again  to rotate to the next round.- A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the  hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an  easy motion, even one handed.- Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines  on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.- A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell  first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often  lost as you realize ""hey, it's jammed!"" before starting to do anything  about clearing it.- Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round  and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the   chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider  this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed  of employment as a revolver.- There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of  operation of many of them requires more training.Some police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietlyswitching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were havingaccidents, partly due to the poor training they received. Not that Glocksrequire rocket scientists, but some cops are baffled by something as complexas the timer on a VCR.Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgunthe police don't know nothing about firearms. Turn off COPS and Hunterand pay attention. I do not seek here to say ""semi-autos are junk""merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. A copwith a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more thanequipped for anything short of a riot.Gun control is hitting what you aim at. If you whip out a wonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don't hit anything.Good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit.I own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weaponto something like the Ruger Security Six revolver. If I haven't hitwhat I'm aiming at in the first 5 shots, something is quite seriouslywrong somewheres. While I might like having the backup capacity of thoseextra shots in certain cases, overwhelmingly the # of shots fired incriminal encounters is less than 5.What do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime? Why the same nice simple.38 revolvers that the police often use. Well actually some police prefer the much heftier .357 Magnum, but anyway.....ObPlea: Don't flame me, I prefer semi-autos for most things.

There is also the 683xx, I think oneof those has the DRAM controller built in. This one is for the 6664DRAM, however, the 41256 has only one more address line, adding onlyanother component or so. The 256k SIMMs are basically 8 or 9 41256DRAM chips (or their equivalent in fewer packages).",4

"From article <Apr.15.00.58.22.1993.28891@athos.rutgers.edu>, by ruthless@panix.com (Ruth Ditucci):I do hope that you are not suggesting that merely because a personreplies in an ""acrid, angry and sarcastic"" manner that thisdemonstrates their 'non-christianity'?  The simple fact is that thereis not a Christian on the face of the planet (that I know of!) that isperfect.  I have been known at times to have a fit of temper, or asulk, but this does not make me any the less a Christian.One of the points of being a Christian (as I perceive it) is to becomeMORE LIKE Christ.  This statement inherently suggests that we ARE NOTalready like Christ.  Jesus never unrighteously lost his temper.  Ido.  Jesus was perfect.  I'm not.You must understand that this is because Christians often forget totreat others as our role-model - Christ - would.  This is because we arehuman and falible.  I, for one, do not pretend to be infalible, and Ihope that my fellow-men will bear with me when I make mistakes.  Thissurely is not too much to ask, when I make every effort to bear with_them_.And don't we know it!Again I say, we are ALL human!To my brethren, this:  Ms Duticci has a valid point and we as Christians ought to heed thewarning in her article.  We oftimes discredit ourselves and ourSaviour, in the way that we treat others.  Strive towards the goal setus by our Lord, but in the meantime, remember :     ""There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ...""When you blow it - go easy on yourself.  Forgive yourself, as yourFather in heaven forgives you!  And remember - and this is something Ifirmly beieve and cling to - one day, we shall see Him face to face,and in that day, we shall (finally!) be perfected.  I look forward to seeing you there.

"The situation: running a Fortran executable that creats an Xterm.  An optionin the menu contained in the Xterm runs a Fortran subroutine that creatsa Tektronics-mode Xterm for displaying some graphics.  Typing a <RET> whilethe Tektronics-mode Xterm (future reference to this will be ""Tek-term"") isactive makes the Xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focusto the Xterm (I'm basing that statement on the fact that the border of the Tek-term stays the highlighted color and that the Tek-term stays on top ofXterm.  If what I'm describing isn't input focus, let me know.)  The xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it.Subsequent selections from the Xterm of the menu item that displays graphics highlihts the border and displays the updated graphics, but does not move the Tek-term to the top.  If the Tek-term has been iconized to conserve screen space, it stays an icon.The desired behavior: one of two options -     1. Whichever of the windows that is active is always on top of the        inactive one.    2. Whenever the Tek-term is inactivated, it should revert to a icon       but when it is activated it should become a window on a higher        level than the Xterm.What I think I need: a means of specifying that a Xterm or Tek-term willbe at the highest level and a way to iconify/expand a Xterm and Tek-term.These commands, would, I'd guess, need to be in the Fortran or in the command that starts up the Xterm and Tek-term.Other information: All this is taking place on a VT-1300 (a DEC dumb X-windows terminal) connected to a VAX running VMS and Motif.Thanks for your time.

"If she is having problems with fresh vegetables, the guess is that thereis some obstruction of the intestine.  Without knowing more it is notpossible to say whether the obstruction is permanent due to scarring,or temporary due to swelling of inflammed intestine.  In general, there areno dietary limitations in patients with Crohn's except as they relateto obstruction.  There is no evidence that any foods will bring on recurrence of Crohn's.

"I'm afraid that I've lost the thread here.  I didn't suggest that all government regulations be subject to referenda.  So I don't follow the comments above.I mean that an ideology that treats all government regulation as equallyundesirable and seeks to abolish all regulations is unlikely to drawsupport among more than a miniscule portion of the electorate.Furthermore, I am suggesting that such a plan is not feasible in anindustrial society because the weight of litigation and/or misery itwould produce would effectively crush productive effort.No, I'm not surprised.  I just think it's interesting that on one handlibertarians assume a limited government can be decreed, yet on the otherposit an entire government made up of people who carry guns.  (I realizethat many libertarians assume that such a government will be counterbalanced by a fully armed citizenry, but it is worth noting thatwidespread civilian ownership of guns does not necessarily prevent theestablishment of totalitarian government, e.g. Iraq.)Yup, sure do.  But since I also support the constitutional requirementthat the government provide for the general welfare (Article I section 8),I'm willing to justify such programs on that basis.Well, in the first place, I don't support a ""socialized economic system.""I think within limits that capitalism is a fine idea.  But it is notthe case that ""any third party...is...as likely to be ignorant or corruptas the buyer or seller.""  There are multitudes of examples where such astatement is demonstrably false.

"Dear folks,I am still awaiting for some sensible answer and comment.It is a fact that the inhabitants of Gaza are not entitled to a normalcivlized life. They habe been kept under occupation by Israel since 1967without civil and political rights. It is a fact that Gazans live in their own country, Palestine. Gaza isnot a foriegn country. Nor is TelAviv, Jaffa, Askalon, BeerSheba foreigncountry for Gazans. All these places are occupied as far as Palestiniansare concerned and as far as common sense has it. It is a fact that Zionists deny Gazans equal rights as Israeli citizensand the right to determine by themsevles their government. When Zionistswill begin to consider Gazans as human beings who deserve the samerights as themselves, there will be hope for peace. Not before.Somebody mentioned that Gaza is 'foreign country' and therefore Israelis entitled to close its borders to Gaza. In this case, Gaza should beentitled to reciprocate, and deny Israeli civilians and military personnelto enter the area. As the relation is not symmetrical, but that of a masterand slave, the label 'foreign country' is inaccurate and misleading.To close off 700,000 people in the Strip, deny them means of subsistenceand means of defending themselves, is a collective punishment and acrime. It is neither justifiable nor legal. It just reflects the abyss to which Israeli society has degraded. I would like to ask any of those who heap foul langauge on me to explainwhy Israel denies Gazans who were born and brought up in Jaffa to returnand live there ? Would they be allowed to, if they converted to Judaism ?Is their right to live in their former town depdendent upon theirreligion or ethnic origin ? Please give an honest answer.",9

"...	It's amazing how everyone automatically blames one side or the other.	One thing for sure:  Koresh will have no chance to defend himself	against the statements (lacking in fact or COurt sponsored verification)	made  by agents who participated in the situation that killed him.		I don't know they murdered him; I also don't know		that the Branch Davidians set a fire and suicidede.		It is SICK of BATF or FBI spokepeople to make such		comments in advance of forensic pathology.	Stephen:  thank you.  God speed.  	Yah.	BINGO.  Am I the only one  to notice:	a)	No peaceful attempt to serve a warrant.	b)	Six months to develop a scene and six days to end it?	c)	.... ah God:			25 children			at least 64 adults			plus 6 at the beginning			and more BATF agents			all dead.	Has anyone asked themselves these questions:	1)  Have you seen the ENTIRE video sequences taken during the	  opening rounds?  I seem to recall missing several key parts:		a)  The first five minutes of day one; only the shooting		  part comes out.		b)  What happened to the Feds video units?  You mean they do		  not carry helmet cams?  Wonder why not?	2)   How is it you can have camera crews with live transmission	  video present and NOT have an uninterrupted record?		a)  You realize the units carry ittle bitty 8mm backups?			That hold 90 minutes per unit?  And there are			twounits on the professional handhelds (so no			tape turnover gaps)?		b)  Until all views are seen, it is premature to point			fingers in either direction.	As you well point out, Stephen.	More on this below.	Yes.  But it is so hard toremain human under the full	pressure of hazard, game playing, and life.	More to the point:  when someone dies (almost like it was intended	that way), both sides will kill to maintain their innocence --		a contradiction in terms.	True.  Usually I pick the unpopular side and point out	from the evidence seen what might have alternatively happened.	This requires someone interested in God's Will.  Please note	that the outstanding _overt_ problem in this country today	is one where the Government:		wants Caesar's coin to pay off the debt.	Yes:  The AMerican People.  Not the Federal Government.	ANd if it is not spent towards that end, _no_one_ deserves	the coin.	Yah.  Fewpeople hear the contradiction:		Money		made		in the image		of God	I wish you were wrong.  Many pundits are saying 3 years.	The onyl good thing to come out of my divorce (and my	exposure to the Damned (pardon me) American Divorce Attorney	is:		I have no money left to lose to taxes or inflation.	25 children dead.  If anyone thinks blaming Koresh -- or the BATF	helps this any at all, is sick.  and wrong.		The reason you can tell that the BATF may not be entirely		straight on this is that the leaders at press conferences		havew made ANY comments about even the POSSIBILITY that		Koresh or his followers caused this.		The BATF agentss are more concerned with their repuations		and morals (""not my fault, Koresh did it!"") than they		are with:			25 dead children.	Same goes for Koresh & his followers - who are all (mostly) dead.	More on power and favoritism.  (My personal opinion).	Look to history:  whenever privilege has replaced whatever	token of objective law and justice a society has had,		Hitlerrs have followed.	You do your name sake proud, Stephen.	Its hard, but please keep on keeping on:		each voice in the wilderness now will		save a generation unborn from horror	The day I _need_ a gun or abomb to protect myself in this	society is the day that society is already beyond redemption		and that aint' redundant, if you have any Christian		belief aytall.	... and the day that I cannot peacefully enjoin others in the	act that Thoreau called Civil Disobedience to rectify the	wrongs that my society practises, without undue harm or	punishment befalling me, is the day that society has ceased to	be a human society, and become a society of animals.		We are _very_ cclose to that.	Six years fighting an unjust COurt issue:  still struggling to be	patient.For those who like contrary questions:	NB:  I was not there.  I am not a Branch Davidian nor a     law	official hater.  I do hate liars or the six letter variety of same.	The official side has its advocates already; lets balance the	equation and asj a few questions on the other side, for the sake	of an old saw the BATF abd FBI seem to want to bypass:		innocent until proven guilty.	not		innocent until presumed guilty.	1)  Where are the video tapes from the tanks?  ALL of them.		Don't tell me they do not exist.  They are standard		equipment.	2)  So you think Koresh fired the place, because of the explosion?		a)  Tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread it.  This		  aerosol is DELIBERATELY made to be as non-flammable		  as possible.  It is as non-flammable as possible.			.... gotcha!		  ... when in isolation from other substances.		  WHy was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote		  launchers?  WHy did the FBI not announce ""this window,		  blown in plus tear gas, five minutes; then the wall come		  down"", and maintain a left to right sequence?		b)  Most aerosols also have a secondary compound, that when		  mixed in, becomes a VERY flammable (and difficult to trace)		  suspension, with a VERY special property:  exposure to		  brief eruptions of high heat (muzzle blasts) or long		  exposure to low heat (matches, a stove) will NOT tend		  to ignite.			What other chemicals come up in the forensics?			Who else will be allowed to test the site?		c)  After a few minutes to hours (ifdesired, the combnation		  rate can be controlled as desired), the mixture can be made		  to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature		  above a certain point (a tracer round) for a certain		  heat quantity (a small explosive charge) or for a length		  of time (start a wall fire and wait).			Check your military records; look at the tapes.			Why were tanks (large capacity delivey systems),			tear gas (why not somnorifics?), and now (why			the hurry. was there still a comm channel open			to the outside?).

"Is it appropriate for the Lord not to reveal certain things before the world (i.e., publish them widely)?These things sacred to Himself.  He may place any pre- or post-conditions He feels are necessary.Moreover, there are precedents in scripture whereknowledge of sacred things is withheld:1. After the Transfiguration Jesus instructedPeter, James, and John to ""tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead"" (Matt. 17:9).  If we were living at the time of Savior, therewould be no (public) record of this event.2. A faithful friend of Paul experiences a vision of ""paradise"" when he ""heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter""(2 Cor. 12:4).This person heard something which Paul can not write to the Corinthians (and us).3. There is an incident recorded in the Book ofMormon where words uttered by ""babes"" were ""forbidden that there should not any man writethem (3 Nephi 26:16, the entire text followsfor those of you without access to the BOM).3 Nephi 26:16Behold, it came to pass on the morrow that the multitude gathered themselves together, and theyboth saw and heard these children; yea, even babes did open their mouths and utter marvelousthings; and the things which they did utter wereforbidden that there should not any man write them.Some LDS scholars speculate that these wordswhich could not be written are the sacredportions from temple we are to withhold from the world (but it could be something else).There is much we can discuss about the temple ordinances.  We can discuss regarding baptismsand other vicarious ordinances for the dead.We can discuss certain concepts regarding theendowment (""the ritual"").However, there are certain elements I can notdiscuss with anyone (including other saints)outside of the temple.As a portion of the endowment, we receive thetokens and signs that will permit us accessto Heaven.  I must keep this knowledge sacred and respect the conditions under which it isrevealed to me.",7

"There were many injustices in the middle ages.  And this is truely sad.I would hate to see a day when churches put people to death or torchuredthem for practicing homosexuality, or any other crime.  The church is notcalled to take over the governments of the world.  It may be that homosexualstreated cruelly today, but that does not mean that we should teach Christians to practice homosexual immorality.  Do you think that we shouldalso teach Christians to practice divination and channelling becausethe witches in the middle ages were persecuted.And you accuse me of judging?  When did you look into my heart and seeif I have love.  I have been writing that we should not teach Christiansto practice homosexual immorality, and you pretend to have divine knowledgeto look into my heart.  I can't say that I love homosexuals as I should-I can't say that I love my neighbor as I should either.  I don't knowvery many homosexuals as it is.  But Jesus loves homosexuals, just as He loves everyone else.  If His lovewere conditional, I not know Him at all.  Yes.  We should show love to homosexuals, but it is not love to encourage brothers in the church to stumble and continue in their sin.  That is a very damaging and dangerous thing.That is slander.   I could just as easily say  that NAMBLA has been ableto implement legislation to make child molesting easier because ofthe tearing down of societies morality due to people accepting homosexualityas normal, and that this is what you are embracing.  I do believethat homosexual sex is immoral, that does not mean I endorse using violenceagainst them.  There is a problem of hatred in the church.  But thereis also the problem of what has been called ""unsanctified mercy.""Many in the conservative churches have seen the moral breakdown in this country and the storm on the horizon, and have gotten militant in the flesh.  This is truely sad.  Yet others in other churches have embraced immorality in society, and have pointed to the carnality in theconservative churches to justify their actions.  Certainly we should not use a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus.But we shouldn't water down the gospel to draw people in.  Jesus didn'tgo out of His way to show only what might be considered positive aspectsto draw people in.  He told one man to sell all He had.  He toldanother not to say good bye to His family.  His words were hard at times.We should present people with the cost of the tower before we allow themto begin construction.  many people have already been innoculated to thegospel.Link Hudson.",11
"This is true for the mass market, but not for those who need strong cryptoand are willing to pay the price. After all, one can buy strong crypto todayif one is willing to spend enough.Thus the concern is not economic.The issue most worth worrying about is that after the system takes hold, thegovernment will outlaw other systems, and something voluntary will becomethe only system available. That is a political, not an economic issue.As a separate matter, you may be making an implied advocacy for cheap securecrypto for everyone. It's true that the Clipper chip would probably preventthat except via Clipper, but ""cheap, secure crypto for everyone"" is apolitical discussion, not an economic one, and the whole point of Clipper is to resolve that political (policy) tension between securing legitimatecommunications and tapping the crooks.",3

This bike looks great! It is now in the shop getting tuned and new tires.  I am opting for the Metzler ME55 and ME33 tires (thanks to those who posted this other thread).  This bike is _BIG_ compared to my other bikes.  ( Sure is alot harder to load on a trailer than the KDX200 was. )  I shouldbe road legal tomorrow.

"      Just a question.       As a provider of a public BBS service - aren't you bound by law to gurantee      intelligble access to the data of the users on the BBS, if police comes      with sufficent authorisation ? I guessed this would be  a basic condition      for such systems. (I did run a bbs some time ago, but that was in Switzerland)The US doesn't yet have many laws covering BBSs - they're not common carriers,they're not phone companies, they're just private machines or servicesoperated by businesses.  There's no obligation to keep records.As Perry Metzger points out, if the police come with a search warrant,you have to let them see what the warrant demands, if it exists,and they generally can confiscate the equipment as ""evidence""(which is not Constitutionally valid, but we're only beginning todevelop court cases supporting us).  A court MAY be able to compelyou to tell them information you know, such as the encryption passwordfor the disk - there aren't any definitive cases yet, since it's a newsituation, and there probably aren't laws specifically covering it.But the court can't force you to *know* the keys, and there are nolaws preventing you from allowing your users to have their own keysfor their own files without giving them to you.Even in areas that do have established law, there is uncertainty.There was a guy in Idaho a few years ago who had his business recordssubpoenaed as evidence for taxes or some other business-restriction law,so he gave the court the records.  Which were in Hebrew.The US doesn't have laws forcing you to keep your records in English,and these were the originals of the records.  HE didn't speak Hebrew,and neither did anybody in the court organization.  Don't think theywere able to do much about it.It might be illegal for your BBS to deny access to potential customersbased on race, religion, national origin, gender, or sexual preference;it probably hasn't been tested in court, but it seems like a plausibleextension of anti-discrimination laws affecting other businesses.",3

"There has been NO hard info provided about MSG making people ill.That's the point, after all.That's because these ""peer-reviewed"" studies are not addressingthe effects of MSG in people, they're looking at animal models.You can't walk away from this and start ranting about gloom anddoom as if there were any documented deleterious health effectsdemonstrated in humans.  Note that I wouldn't have any argumentwith a statement like ""noting that animal administration has pro-duced the following [blah, blah], we must be careful about itsuse in humans.""

I'm familiar withthe literature, and I've never seen any which relate at all toOlney's work in animals and the effects of glutamate on neurons.Well, actually, they HAVE to tolerate some phenylalanine; it's aessential amino acid.  They just try to get as little as is healthywithout producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolitesin the blood.Goodness, I'm not saying that it's good to feed infants a lot ofglutamate-supplemented foods.  It's just that this ""projected safetymargin"" is a construct derived from animal models and given that,you can ""prove"" anything you like.  We're talking prudent policy ininfant nutrition here, yet you're misrepresenting it as received wisdom.You mean ""asserting"".  You're being intellectually dishonest (or justplain confused), because you're conflating reports which do not necessarilyhave anything to do with each other.  Olney's reports would argue a potentialfor problems in human infants, but that's not to say that this says anythingwhatsoever about the use of MSG in most foods, nor does he provide anystudies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects (for obviousreasons.)  It says nothing about MSG's contribtion to the phenomenonof the ""Chinese Restaurant Syndrome"".  It says nothing about the frequentinability to replicate anecdotal reports of MSG sensitivity in the lab.Probably one of the dumber remarks you've made.",5

"April 13, 1993 response by Al Moore (L629159@LMSC5.IS.LMSC.LOCKHEED.COM):Basically the problem is that Israel may remain, or leave, the occupied territories; it cannot do both, it cannot do neither. So far, Israe continues to propose that they remain. The Palestinians propose that they leave. Why should either change their view? It is worth pointing out that the only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require areduction in the Israeli presence. Israel proposes no such reduction....and in fact may be said to *not* be negotiating.------------------------------------------------------------------------Tim: There seem to be two perceptions that **have to be addressed**. Thefirst is that of Israel, where there is little trust for Arab groups, sothere is little support for Israel giving up **tangible** assets in exchange for pieces of paper, ""expectations"", ""hopes"", etc. The secondis that of the Arab world/Palestinians, where there is the demand thatthese ""tangible concessions"" be made by Israel **without** it receivinganything **tangible** back.  Given this, the gap between the two stancesseems to be the need by Israel of receiving some ***tangible*** returnsfor its expected concessions. By ""tangible"" is meant something that1) provides Israel with ""comparable"" protection (from the land it is to give up), 2) in some way ensures that the Arab states and Palestine **will be** accountable and held actively (not just ""diplomatically) responsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory (by citizens or ""visitors"").In essence I do not believe that Israel objections to Palestinianstatehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now IF Israelwas assured that any new Palestinian state *would be committed to** co-existing with Israel and held responsible for ALL attacks on Israel from its territory.	Aside from some of the rather slanted proposals above,	how *could* such ""guarantees"" be instilled? For example,	how could such ""guarantees""/""controls"" be added to the	Palestinian PISGA proposals?Israel is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minuteit lets go (gives lands back to Arab states, no more ""buffer zone"", givesfull autonomy to Palestinians), ANY and/or ALL of the Arab partiescould (and *would*, if not ""controlled"" somehow) EASILY return to the traditional anti-Israel position.

The HGA was left closed,  because galileo  had a venus flyby.If the HGA were pointed att he sun,  near venus,  it wouldcook the foci elements.question:  WHy couldn't Galileo's  course manuevers have beendesigned such that the HGA  did not ever do a sun point.?After all,  it would normally be aimed at earth anyway?or would it be that an emergency situation i.e. spacecraft safingand seek might have caused an HGA sun point?",6
"-*----I agree with everything that Lee Lady wrote in her previous post inthis thread.  In case this puzzles people, I would like to expandon two of her comments.One of the most important (and difficult) aspects of reasoningabout empirical investigation lies in understanding the context,scope, and importance of the various arguments and pieces ofevidence that are marshalled for a claim.  Some errors break theback of a piece of research, some leave a hole that needs to befilled in, and some are trivial in their importance.  It is agrave mistake to confuse these.Past snippets from this thread:Back to Lee Lady:These posters are making the mistake that I have previouslycriticized of adhering to a methodological recipe.  A ""carefullydesigned and controlled study"" is neither always possible noralways important.  (On the other hand, if someone is proposing aremedy that supposedly alleviates a chronic medical problem, wehave enough knowledge of the errors that have plagued *this* kindof claim to ask for a ""carefully designed and controlled study""to alleviate our skepticism.)Rules such as ""support the hypothesis by a carefully designed andcontrolled study"" are too narrow to apply to *all* investigation.I think that the requirements for particular reasoning to beconvincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that haveoccurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things.  (Toreuse the previous example, we know that conclusions fromuncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medicalproblems are notoriously problematic.)  ",5

Good I had a bad feeling about this problem because of a special casewith no solution that worried me.Four coplanar points in the shape of a square have no unique sphere that they are on the surface of.Similarly 4 colinear point have no finite sized sphere that they are on thesurface of.These algorithms being geometrical designed rather than algebraically designmeet these problems neatly.When determining which plane the 3 points are on if they are colinearthe algorithm should afil or return infinite R.When intersecting the two lines there are 2 possibilitiesthey are the same line  (the 4 points were on a planar circle)they are different lines but parallel. There is a sphere of in radius.This last case can be achieved with 3 colinier points and any 4th pointby taking the 4th point and pairs of the first 3 parallel lines will be producedit can also be achieved byIf all 4 points are coplanar but are not on one circle. It seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the 4 points are coplanar.The algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar.(4 points being colinear => coplanar)Testing if the 4th point is coplanar when the plane of the first 3 pointshas been found is trivial.,1
"I just got off the phone with Mathsoft technical service. Theyare now admitting a problem of unknown nature with Maple andNorton Desktop for Windows.

They made no schedule promices,but are actively working on the problem.In the meantime, the workaround is to provide a configurationselection in autoexec.bat to use PROGMAN (yuk, pew) wheneveryou plan to use the Maple solver and NDW otherwise.

": you mention could cut it as stars in the NHL! Even ""Rexi"" in his prime was more: of a good regular in New York/Edmonton than a superstar in his own right,: although some blamed that on lack of effort on his behalf.:I think that the NY management made a mistake, and remember how Edmonton called Reksa in the middle of the season to win the cup ? Why did they callhim? : Yeah, we've had a tendency to beat ourselves in the past. I almost knifed my: brother in anger when Sweden scored two in the final minute of the WC : semifinals back in 1986:-) Or what about the three goals Antero Kivela let in: with five minutes to go against the Russkies in Lake Placid'80? Ugh . . . O.K., that was BAD luck. If Penguins have the same kind of luck this year inthe playoffs, they'll never win the cup. They are still the best team.",2

"Here are four pseudo-random character generators, based onirreducible trinomials.  Each contains 16 separate trinomials,one of which is selected on initialization (there are 64distinct trinomials between the 4 PRCGs).

"Not particularly *in* the World Series. During the season, he was probablymore valuable than, say, putting Olerud out there to pitch, but yeah, he*was* valuable in getting them there. In the postseason, he sucked dirtycanal water through a straw. The Jays won *in spite* of Morris much morethan *because of* him.Umm, Roger? Return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago,where the poster Valentine was replying to used # of WS rings as a measureof better. The concept is called ""context"", and you should really becomefamiliar with it someday.Unless this transaltes to ""Clemens hasn't gone into Lou Gorman's office witha large caliber handgun and refused to come out until he'd been traded tothe Jays,"" I'm at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it.What on earth does this mean? Over their careers, Clemens has ""won"" 68% ofthe games he's started, Morris 58%. Per year, Clemens has averaged nearly 17wins, Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventingthe other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? Ifso, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. Morrisallows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never inhis career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens' career ERA. ButI forget, in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significanceto Buckner missing that grounder in 1986; had Morris been on the Sox, itwould have been a routine groundout, right?Speaking of stupid, it has been patiently (and not-so-patiently) explained toyou many times that attributing greatness to players based on theaccomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming thata racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race. Yourcontinued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply toany of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must havespent a few too many games in goal without a mask.No one is crying; the Jays won, and as a team they certainly deserved to winat least the AL East. They performed well in two short series and won theWorld Series, and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan, I hope theykeep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when theytraded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical linkbetween Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the manwas credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. Luck runsout, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992,gave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16.Seriously, Roger, I'd really like to hear your explanation of the differencebetween the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris. Which one was a better pitcher,and why? Did Morris somehow ""learn how to win"" in the intervening ten years?If so, then why did he go 18-12 in 1991 with Minnesota with an ERA over halfa run lower than 1992?

Seems that the 1993 Mustang 5.0 is rated at 205 hp ONLY because Ford changed its testing procedures.  Under the older procedures, it still  rates closer to 225 hp.  That means that the Mustang has 3 hp more.  And you still haven't posted any weight figures for the Mustang. Yeah, sure, in your wet dreams.  And that's probably where you got  that 11.2 second 0-60 for the Stealth. For 3 posts now you've been harping on this May 1991 issue of Car & Driver without posting any numbers.  Why not?  Because they prove me right and you ain't got the guts to admit it?  Yeah, thought so. No, I'm going to play your game -       No way, Sentra's are SLOW!

"Joe Torre has to be the worst manager in baseball.For anyone who didn't see Sunday's game,With a right hander pitching he decides to bench Lankform, a left handedhitter and play jordan and gilkey, both right handers.Later, in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he putslankford, a 300 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses LuisAlicea, a 250 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter.  What the Hellis he thinking.Earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring Mark Whiten he commentedhow fortunate the Cardinals were to get Whiten and that Whiten would be aregular even though this meant that Gilkey would be hurt, But torre saidhe liked Gilkey coming off the bench.  Gilkey hit over 300 last year,what does he have to do to start, The guy would be starting on most everyteam in the league.Furthermore, in Sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate, The replay showed Bucky Dent the third base coach looking down the lineand waving lankford home, I can't take this anymorebrian, a very distressed cardinal fan.-- ",19

"I'd like to compile X11r5 on a Sony NWS-1750 running NEWS 4.1c.  TheX distribution has support for this config, and the release notes sayit has been tested on the machine.  BUT, also in the release notes,nothing from Sony is listed under the supported servers.  What am Isupposed to use for my r5 X server then?  How can the OS be supported,but not the hardware? Is there something in the r4 binaries that canbe used as the r5 server? These may seem like silly questions, butI'm *really* confused.-- mike@hopper.acs.virginia.edu ",15
"Now the bike is off warranty, I finally replaced the stock items on mySoftail Custom with the title ones. Installation was pretty easy inboth cases, even for a fairly non-mechanical chemist type dude like me! I discovered the limitations of my tool collection, but had fun buyingand making the requisite tools!MC Ignitions Power Arc II Single Fire Ignition: easy to install, butread the wiring diagram carefully!  Setting the static timing was apiece of cake.  Once installed, I have found easier starting, smootheridle, and more power, plus a more satisfying (to me) bass note in theexhaust register...a lovely whompa-whompa-whompa idle  :-)The folks at MC Ignitions were great in answering my dumb questions onthe phone..... a very helpful bunch of guys with a great product.S&S Super E Carb: installation easy, once I hacked down an Allen wrenchto a small anough reach to get at the intake manifold bolts. Tunes likea dream, just like they say!  The stock carb (non-adjustable) was solean that it was gasping and spluttering for gas sometimes, and evenbackfiring into the intake manifold. The Super E is terrific, nohesitation in any gear, and my plugs are a lovely tan color with noneed to rejet from the factory settings!I know this may not seem like much to you grizzled veteran wrenchersout there, but I had my bike in so many pieces this weekend I began toget worried. But it all went back together again, and runs like adream, so I am feeling pretty happy.Now all I have to do is install my BUB pipes and try to pass the NHNoise Gestapo Test!",18
"}>For several years I've periodically asked Charley Wingate to explain this}>mythical alternative to rationality which he propounds so enthusiastically}>when he pops up every few months.  His reluctance to explain indicates to me}>that it's not so hot.}}I've said enough times that there is no ""alternative"" that should think you}might have caught on by now.  And there is no ""alternative"", but the point}is, ""rationality"" isn't an alternative either.  The problems of metaphysical}and religious knowledge are unsolvable-- or I should say, humans cannot}solve them.If there is truly no alternative, then you have no basis whatsoeverfor your claim.  The usual line here, which you call ""a prejudgment ofatheism"", and dispute, is that reason is all we have.  Here you admitthat you have no alternative, no possible basis for the claim thatthere is anything other than reason or that reason is inapplicable inreligious knowledge, except possibly that reason conflicts with""religious knowledge"".This sounds very much like ""I can't provide a rational defense for mybelief, but prefer to discard rationality rather than accept that itmay be false"".  I hope it makes you happy, but your repeated andunfounded assertions to this effect don't advance your cause.",0

"From Denning:   the Skipjack encryption algorithm   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips   N, a 30-bit serial number   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and    E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.  Where the session key is K, and is transmitted encrypted in the unit Key U.Which along with the serial number N is encrypted in the Family key F.Presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differentialanalysis).Postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chipand its communications channel.  The function of this spoof chip is twofold:    	1) Transmit Channel	    The spoof chip XORs the 30 bit encrypted serial number with	    a secondary keying variable.  This renders the serial number	    unrecoverable with just the family key	2) Receive Channel	    The spoof chip XORs the incoming encrypted serial number	    with a secondary keying variable (assuming integrity of the	    law enforcement block is necessary for local operation -	    checksums, sequence control, etc.).This has the net result of hiding the serial number.  It is probable theere isa known plaintext pattern used as a filler in the block containing N (34 bitsas used in generating U, U1,U2) correctness of the law enforcement blockcan be determined with only the family key F.  Whereas, no one has proposedFederal Agencies be denied F, and because they could recover it themselves,The correctness of the serial number can be tested by examining the pad bitsof N in E[N; F].The one could selectively alter the law enforcement block as above, but themutilation could be detected.  A better approach would be to mutilate theentire law enforcement block.  If it were done with a group encryption schemesuch as DES or (presumably) Skipjack, the chances the law enforcement blockcan be recovered are lessened.What do you want to bet the transmission protocol can be recognized and theserial numbers decrypted in a target search?  When digital transmissionbecomes widely available, would there be a requirement that clipper protocoltransmissions be refused when containing mutilated law enforcement blocks?One way to avoid notice, would be to spoof protocol information of the blockcontaining M, as well as spoofing the law enforcement block.The goal is to use a secure communications scheme, without redress to detection or key K interception (contained encrypted within the lawenforcement block).  The data stream is returned to its original statefor use by the clipper chip (or system) if required, for proper operation.It is somewhat improbable that the entire protocol will be contained withinthe clipper chip, yet likely that sequence of events will be tested for,requiring a valid law enforcement block to be received before acceptingand decrypting E(M; K);The spoof chip could be implemented anywhere in the protocols, includingon the resulting serial data stream.  Existing clipper products couldbe subborned.  After all, they are high security encryption systems right?Super encipherment/encryption could allow the chip to be used withoutredress to detection of the use of the chip, or disclosure of the serialnumber.  Security must be adequate to deny the serial number, which shouldnot be recoverable by other means.  One can see the use of cut outs forprocurring clipper phones, or once the number of units is high enough,stealing them.  It would be a mistake on the part of authority, but nicefrom a point of privacy, if the serial number N were not associated witha particular clipper chip or lot of chips through the manufacturing and distribution process.  Hopefully the list of known missing or stolenclipper serial numbers N encrypted with F, and the protocols are not sufficient plaintext to attact the super encrypted clipper stream.This could be further made difficult by altering the temporal and orspatial relationship of the clipper stream to that of the super encryptedstream.Detection of an encrypted stream could tip off the use of the aforementionedscheme.******************************************************************************If you could capture valid law enforcement blocks not your own, and usethem in a codebook sustitution with your own, where they point to a validlaw enforcement block stored in a library utilizing a session key matchingthe remainder of the transmission, you could simply out and out lie, yetdeliver to monitoring and/or hostile forces a seemingly valid law enforcementblock.   These captured law enforcement blocks would be used as authenticators,such as in a manually keyed encryption system.  Fending this off would requireescalation in examining the protocols and blocks in the transmission.The M code stream  might be independently attacked based on knowledge ofclipper chip protocols as revealed plaintext.  This could be invalidatedby changing the temporal and or spatial relationship of the clipper M streamand the actual transmitted stream, under the control of a secure keygenerator synchronized between endpoints.The useful life time of captured law enforcement blocks might be limitedbased on hostile forces using them as targets following transmissioninterception.  You would need a large number of them, but, hey there'ssupposed to be millions of these things, right?  Adding time stamps tothe encrypted law enforcement block is probably impractical, who wantsan encryption chip with a real time clock?*****************************************************************************",3

"Posted by Cathy Smith for L. Neil Smith                   LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE[AUTHOR'S NOTE:  ""Adrian"" -- name changed to protect the guilty -- and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with the same editor at a famous New York publishing house.]Dear Adrian:  I'm way behind schedule on my current book again, so this reply to your note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and generally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist mostly of assertions you're free to believe (or not) I can back with evidence and logic I've neither time nor energy to present now.  I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the future.  When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.  There are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger of delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan. 10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition, shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent with your note.  First, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Second, publication of some latter-day ""scientific study"" doesn't alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.  Third, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Fourth, as often happens with these things, the ""study"" doesn't support the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions anyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older body of lies, omissions, and distortions.  Fifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Sixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on countless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this present ""study"" dubious, to say the least.  Seventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Eighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat (not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you should be better aware than most people how ""progress"" -- in designing ""studies"" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our ability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30 years to create ""studies"" ""proving"" that pornography causes crime.  More naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s clearly indicate the contrary.  Ninth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Tenth, another reason to doubt all such ""studies"" is that human behavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is fartoo complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.  Eleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  Twelfth, the ""study"" is also worthless because it incorporates figures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but basically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social benefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a criminal offense.  Thirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials quoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are many), are correct in this instance:  the ""study"" is meaningless because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  And because of that, Adrian, even if the ""study"" were valid, it wouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however, whenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's permission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists themselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed people to go out and buy their first gun ""while they still can"".  Before the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the ""shooting fraternity"" viewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate, ineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in the whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys, and their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we probably manufacture at least that many every year.The fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly aware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what their real motives are.  Look:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way, it's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic; the fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the self-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing this further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a quarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated ""half life"" of 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna be around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.As for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law provides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I will always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands -- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics and semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.  So what's the point?  L.

The big problems I have encountered inporting MFC to BC++ is that fact that MFC _depends_ on a couple ofinvalid C++ assumptions.I have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under BC++, butthe reason is that MS makes some bad assumptions about the order inwhich static/global objects are initialized (i.e. some objects aregetting accessed before they are initialized).  The problem is in theowner-draw menu code somewhere-- if you comment out that section, allother pieces of ctrltest work fine.Two other major gotchas I have found using MFC under BC++:- The CFile::OpenFlags enum uses hard-coded numbers for the open mode,  rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl.h (which differ  between MSC and BC).- All of the MFC collection classes depend on another bad C++  assumption-- that a reference to a base object can used be in place  of a reference to a derived object (true for pointers, NOT for  references).I am sure there are other problems along the same lines, but I havenot encountered them (yet).  I have not seen MFC 2.0 yet, but I hopethat some of these will be addressed.  If they are not, all of MS'shype about portability to other vendor's compilers will be just that.",12

"1992-93 Los Angeles Kings notes and game reports.-------------------------------------------------Kings 6 @ Calgary Flames 3 - 04/18/93The third place Kings opened the 1993 Stanley Cup Playoffs in Calgary, againstthe second place Flames and came out with an impressive 6-3 victory in front ofa non-sellout crowd of 18,605 at the Saddledome in Calgary.Symthe Division playoff hockey this was.  Both teams seemed a bit tense in theopening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off.  The Kings gotinto the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out-standing team defense.  It took the Flames 9:45 of the first period to recordtheir first shot on goal.  The Kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams onpenalty killing, shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play and could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings hadtheir problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10tries.The Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at theblue line, allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the Flames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex-pected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horsein his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to the dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this morning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday.1st period: 1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky wonthe draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped thepuck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to thefar side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. Heput the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set upin 'his office', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle whereSydor had moved in.  Sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the hash mark, shot off the pass, beating Vernon low and between the legs.Millen and Fleury went off at 4:57.  Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kingsfailed to convert.  Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert.Dahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30, giving the Kings a 30second 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts inthe period.2nd period: The Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failedto convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck intothe stands and received a delay of game.1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with thepuck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit the stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated down the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle andskated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him and he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander.2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play.Shuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headedfor the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot where 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carsoncame from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shotbetween the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease.3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked offthe puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a passcross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot,beating a diving Vernon on the glove side.4-1. 2:59 later, the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form thenear point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got hisown rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the lowslot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon.Skrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40, giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but theyfailed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutivepower plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for highsticking at 17:31.  Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period.  TheKings hit 3 goal post in the period.3rd period:The Kings used the phrase ""Initiate, not retaliate"" and it was very evident herein the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames continued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark.  The Kings shotthe puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net tocut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him,wacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to thecrease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the netwhere Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon.Sydor went off at 1:24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4.5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the netand passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the crease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey.Carson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleurytripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where Fleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing a 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark.  Unfortunately, the Kings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6:44) and Watters (at 8:19) took penalties.  5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark.  MacInnis, at the near point, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards thenet, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove ofHrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA.6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power playto seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone cut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed the puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass, beating Vernon on the ice, stick side.At the 16:17 mark, Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as hewent after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a singleminor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flamesright out of the game.On the plus side:  The Kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockeyas they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellentpenalty killing.On the minus side:  The Kings lost almost every face-off.  This must improve orthe Flames will surely get that power play back on track.Notes:------The Kings recalled Guy Leveque, Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix.Wayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point.The Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, givingthe opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game.Flames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3-9-1 record in afternoon games.  The Flames entered the game with a 34% success rate on the power playover their last 9 games.The teams were 3-3-1 against each other in the regular season.Playoffs:Campbell Conference:Smythe Division:LA  6  @ CAL 3 		LA leads 1-0WIN    @ VANNorris Division:STL 4  @ CHI 3		STL leads 1-0TOR    @ DETWales Conference:Adams Division:BUF 5  @ BOS 4 (OT)	BUF leads 1-0MON 2  @ QUE 3 (OT)	QUE leads 1-0Patrick Division:NJ  3  @ PIT 6		PIT leads 1-0NYI 1  @ WAS 3		WAS leads 1-0Records:--------vs	Smythe	 Norris	 Patrck	Adams	Overall================================================Home:    0- 0-0  0-0-0   0-0-0  0-0-0    0- 0-0 Road:    1- 0-0  0-0-0   0-0-0  0-0-0    1- 0-0==============================================================Total:   1- 0-0  0-0-0   0-0-0	0-0-0	 1- 0-0  Box Score:=========================Calgary      0 1 2 - 3Los Angeles  1 3 2 - 6=========================1st period: LA  Sydor 1 (Gretzky, Sandstrom), 0:16    LA  Millen - high sticking, 4:57    CAL Fleury - high sticking, 4:57    CAL Skrudland - interference, 12:25    LA  Carson - tripping 14:53    CAL Dahlquist - holding stick, 18:34    CAL Dahl - roughing 19:302nd period:     CAL Verson - delay of game (served by Ashton), 1:34CAL Suter 1 (Fleury), 2:48 (sh)LA  Carson 1 (Shuchuk, Sydor), 3:13 (pp)LA  Huddy 1 (Taylor, Rychel), 3:37LA  McSorley 1 (unassisted), 6:36    CAL Skrudland - elbowing, 10:53    LA  Sydor - tripping, 12:35    LA  Watters- hooking, 14:40    LA  McSorley - holding, 17:19    CAL Suter - high sticking, 17:31    LA  Sandstrom - hooking, 18:033rd period:LA  Millen 1 (Granato, Donnelly), 1:06    LA Sydor - hooking, 1:24    CAL Nieuwendyk - tripping, 3:22CAL Dahlquist 1 (Otto), 4:23    CAL Fleury - major (boarding), game misconduct, 6:08    LA  Granato - tripping, 6:44    LA  Watters - interference, 8:19CAL Yawney 1 (MacInnis, Reichel), 8:47    CAL MacInnis - roughing, 9:56LA  Carson 2 (Sandstrom, Robitaille), 10:32 (pp)    LA  Hardy - holding, 11:38    CAL Skrudland - slashing, 16:17    CAL Stern - double roughing, cross-checking, 10 min. misconduct, 16:17Overtime: noneShots:------Los Angeles   8  9 14 - 31Calgary       5  8 11 - 24Power play conversions:-----------------------For:      2 of 10; for the year:  2 of  10,  20.00%Against:  0 of  8; for the year:  8 of   8, 100.00%Goalies:--------Los Angeles - Hrudey (1-0-0)Calgary - Vernon (0-1-0)Attendance: 18,605Scratches:----------Rob Blake - back contusionGuy Leveque - numbersLonnie Loach - numbersMarc Potvin - numbersBrandy Semchuk - numbersRobb Stauber - numbersBrent Thompson - numbersJim Thomson - numbersLines - Forwards:----------------*Robitaille - Gretzky - Sandstrom Donnelly - Millen - KurriRychel - Conacher - TaylorGranato - Carson - ShuchukLines - Defense:----------------*Huddy - SydorWatters - ZhitnikHardy - McSorley* denotes starting lineupNext game:----------Wednesday, April 21 @ Calgary Flames; 6:30pm Pacific Time on Prime Ticket===============================================================================Stan Willis (willis@empire.dnet.hac.com)net contact: L.A.

"Hello,	I remember running across an ad in the back of Mac[User|World]a few years ago, for a Nubus board that had umpteen SIMM slots, to beused to ""recycle your old SIMMs,"" when you upgraded memory.  I don'tremember who made this board, and I haven't seen it advertised inany of the latest Mac magazines.  It mentioned that it included softwareto make the SIMMs on the board act like a RAM disk. As someone who has SIMMS he can't get rid of/use, but hates the waste, this sounds to me like a majorlygood idea.  Does anyone out there know what board/company I'm talking about?

"HelloI have recently suffered from various problems concerningan Adaptec 1542A controller.Problem 1:Floppy disk drive doesn't work. There's apparently at least two jumperson the controller that affect the floppy disk drive. Unfortunately Ihave located only one of them (in the lower front corner). I would liketo know, if there are any other such jumpers and possibly where they are located.Problem 2:My hard disks refuse to boot. With my two SCSI HD's (Rodime, Miniscribe)I get a message 'Missing operating system', even though the disks have beenformatted with the same controller and they damn sure have an operatingsystem on them. If I boot from a Quantum I might get as far as gettingthe MS-DOS version information. This might of course be due to incombatiblememory drivers.Are there any jumpers that could affect the HD causing such errors?	Thanks in advance        Jouni",13
"It would if malpractice and ""defensive medicine"" were the mainfactors in explaining spiralling US health care costs, but they aren't.Although Gary is correct in noting that malpractice-related problems aregreater in the US than Canada, they by no means account for the overalldifference in health care costs.  (They do account for a somewhat largerportion of the difference in physicians' gross income in the two countries.)Some facts.  Malpractice insurance and awards account for less than 1% oftotal health care costs in the US.  In 1991, according to a survey of physicians conducted by a national medical journal physicians averagedpaying 3.7% of their practice receipts in malpractice insurance.  Malpractice insurance premiums and malpractice awards peaked in 1985;they've declined significantly since then.  At the same time, healthcare costs have increased more than any period in history.As far as ""defensive medicine"" is concerned, the AMA estimates that itstotal impact is about $7 billion per year.  That's about 8% of the totalcurrent INCREASE in health care costs -- and the estimate is from a groupthat could be expected to overestimate the impacts of defensive medicineon health care.As small a problem as this is in the overall scheme of things, however,Clinton has been on record for a long time favoring an indemnificationof MD's against malpractice suits if they follow procedures set by theirspecialties.  This would eliminate most, if not all frivolous suitswhile retaining the ability to sue for true malpractice.jsh",10
"I've got two lines coming into my apartment. Two different telephone numbers.When I ordered the second line installed, instead of bringing out another 4wire bundle, the telco just connected up to my yellow and black wires. So Ihave one line on red & green and the other on yellow & black.Today I was monitoring the voltage on both lines. I had a voltmeter acrossthe red and green and read back 52 volts. I then lifted up the receiver on mysecond line.(black & yellow wires) The voltage dropped to 31 volts on the firstline. (red & green wires) I repeated this experiment with the secondline(monitoring black & yellow and lifting the handset off the cradle on thered and green line.) It also dropped to 31 volts. Why is this ? I thought these were separate lines.Next I went to the 66 block and disconnected the blue and white lines coming infrom the telco cable. I then disconnected all the phones in my apartment andwent back to the 66 block and did some resistance measurements. Both lines readopen.I'll appreciate any help on this.

"David,  As an economist, I'm sure you can see the flaws in this logic. If the (naive)market is flooded with proprietary, but weak, encryption, then truly strong encryption will be unable to compete. Suppose the govt had a secret TV broadcaststandard, and then sold TVs below cost. Private industry has a better standard,but it's not as widespread due to the govt early flooding of the marketwith cheap proprietary sets. Even though the industry's technology is better,the programming is being broadcast to the govt's unduplicatable standard.Who could compete?  The other flaw, of course, is that making something voluntary today ensuresthat it will be voluntary in the future. I went to renew my CA drivers licenselast week and was required not only to give my SSN, but to PRODUCE AN SSNCARD to veryify the number!

"THE WHITE HOUSE                  Office of the Press Secretary                    (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)______________________________________________________________For Immediate Release                         April 17, 1993     	                         INTERVIEW OF THE PRESIDENT                      BY MICHAEL WHITELY OF                    KDKA-AM RADIO, PITTSBURGH	                      Pittsburgh International Airport                     Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania    10:40 A.M. EDT	     	     	     Q	  For everyone listening on KDKA Radio, I'm Mike Whitely, KDKA Radio News.  We're here at the Pittsburgh International Airport and with me is the President of the United States Bill Clinton.	     	     And I'd like to welcome you to the area and to KDKA.	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mike.  Glad to be here.	     	     Q	  There are a lot of things we'd like to talk about in the brief amount of time we have, but some news is just breaking from Los Angeles.  I guess the entire country has been kind of holding their breath, wondering what's going to happen in the trial of the four Los Angeles police officers.  We just heard that two of those officers, the sergeant, Sergeant Koon and Officer Powell have been found guilty, and two officers have been found not guilty.	     	     It's a situation that's been building for over a year since the first trial and now this trial and this verdict.  And I wonder what your thoughts are this morning on how you see the situation in Los Angeles in connection with your administration and what you're trying to do.	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I think the American people should know that this trial, in my judgment, is a tribute to the work and judgment of the jury, as well as to the efforts of the federal government in developing the case.	     	     The law under which the officers were tried is a complex one; the standards of proof are complicated.  The jury decided that they would convict the sergeant who was responsible for supervising the officers and the officer who on the film did most of the beating.  The jury acquitted an officer who kicked Rodney King, but also plainly tried to shield him from some blows, and another officer who was a rookie.	     	     No one knows exactly why they did what they did, but it appears that they really tried to do justice here.  They acknowledged that his civil rights were violated.  And I think that the American people should take a lot of pride in that.  But I hope now we can begin to look ahead and focus on three things:  first of all, the importance of trying to bring this country together and not violate the civil rights of any American; secondly, the importance of renewing our fight against crime.  	     	     I think it's important to recognize that in the poorest areas of Los Angeles and many other cities in this country, people may be worried about police abuse, but they're even more worried about crime.  It's time that we renewed our efforts to go to community policing -- put 100,000 more police officers on the street; pass the Brady Bill that would require a waiting period before people could buy a handgun, and do some other things to reduce the vulnerability of our people to violence and drugs.	     	     And the last point I'd like to make is it seems to me that we have got to rededicate ourselves to the economic revitalization of our cities and other economically-distressed areas.  If you just think about it -- if everybody in Los Angeles who wanted a job had one, I don't think we'd have quite as many problems as we do.  	     	     And I laid out a very ambitious program in the campaign to try to bring private investment and public investment to bear in our cities.  I have dispatched the Commerce Secretary, Ron Brown, to California to try to come up with some strategies for that state, because it's our biggest state with our highest unemployment rate -- which could then be applied around the country.  I want to talk to him and to the Attorney General, to the new head of the NAACP, to Reverend Jackson, and to several other people, and then I'll decide where to go from here with regard to Los Angeles and the other cities of the country.	     	     Q	  Let's talk about what brings you to the Pittsburgh area today.  There have been -- I guess there's been a lot of discussion on Capitol Hill about your stimulus package.  You've been locked in a battle with the GOP.  Yesterday, as you said earlier in your radio address, you made some moves to break that gridlock.  What brings you to Pittsburgh, in particular to Allegheny County, in particular to Pennsylvania, with that battle?	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, there are two reasons.  First of all, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and Pennsylvania supported me in the last election because they wanted a new direction in economic policy.  We have passed our overall economic plan; it gives the country a very different budget for the next five years than we've had in the previous 12.  We reduced the deficit and, at the same time, increased investment in jobs and education and health care, in the things that will make us a stronger country.	     	     But in addition to that, I asked the Congress in the short run to spend a little more money, a modest amount of money to create another half-million jobs in the next year and a half; to try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent; but also to try to spark job creation in the private sector more.  The plan passed the House.  It has the support of a majority of the Senate.  At the present time, all the Republican   senators as a bloc are filibustering the bill.  That is, they won't let it come to a vote.	     	     I believe that Senator Specter would like to vote for the bill.  And I believe that Senator Dole, the Republican leader, has put a lot of pressure on a lot of the Republicans to stay hitched.  And they're all saying that this bill increases the deficit.  It doesn't.  This bill is well below the spending targets that Congress approved, including the Republicans, for this year.  This bill is paid for by budget cuts in the next five years.  This bill is designed to give a jump-start to the economy.  And I must say, a lot of the Republican senators that are holding it up, when Mr. Bush was President, voted for billions of dollars of emergency spending of just this kind --much of it was totally unrelated to creating jobs.	     	     So what I'm trying to do is to break this logjam.  I've held out an olive branch, I've offered a compromise.  But I think that we ought to try to put some more Americans to work right now to show that we're changing the direction of the country.  And that's the purpose of the bill.	     	     Q	  Have you been in touch with Senator Specter or his office lately?	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we've been trying to talk regularly to -- through my White House Congressional Liaison operation to the senators that we think are open to this --Senator Specter, Senator D'Amato from New York, Senator Jeffords from Vermont, Senator Hatfield from Oregon, and five or six others whom we believe know we need more jobs in this economy and know that we are paying for this with budget cuts over the life of the budget I presented.	     	     You know, it has a lot of appeal to say, well, we've got a big deficit, we shouldn't increase it more.  But the truth is that we are paying for this with budget cuts in the whole life of the budget over the next few years.  And more importantly, we have this program well below the spending targets that Congress has already approved for this year.  And they've done this for years, with the Republicans voting for it -- many Republicans voting for it -- for things that weren't nearly as important as putting the American people back to work.  	     	     So I just hope that this doesn't become a political issue.  It ought to just be about the people of this country and the need for jobs.	     	     Q	  I have some questions from people who supported you, and some people who are skeptical about your administration.  It has to do with their hopes, and also with their fears.  A lot of people who supported you and voted for you in Pennsylvania --I think some of them are now saying, we're glad we got him in the White House, but now look at this incredible process he has to go through.  Look at these problems.  Look at this gridlock.  And they're beginning to wonder, is this going to work; can you pull it off?  And, of course, your skeptics are saying, well, I knew it was going to be like this.	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I would -- I'd ask people, first of all, to remember that we are, frankly, moving very fast.  The budget resolution that the Congress passed is the fastest they have ever passed a budget resolution -- ever -- in history, setting out the next five-year budget targets.  So we are moving really rapidly.  And we've got them working on political reform, welfare reform, health care reform, a whole wide range of things.  	     	     But it's a big operation.  You can't expect to turn it around overnight.  It took 12 years to produce the conditions which led to the victory I received from the people in November, and we can't turn it around in 90 days.  But I think we're making real, real progress.  	     	     I would urge the people not to get discouraged.  We're not going to win every battle, and not everything is going to happen overnight.  But we are definitely moving and changing things.	     	     Q	  Thank you very much.  	     	     The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, here live at Pittsburgh International Airport.  I'm Mike Whitely, KDKA News.",10

I have also had an appellate court uphold such actionand hide behind California Rules of Court, Rule 106 (""The judges ofthe appellate department shall not be required to write opinions inany cases decided by them, but may do so whenever they deem itadvisable or in the public interest."").

"I missed the first article[s] on this line due to not having achance to read the news for a couple of days...The idea is commercialized in at least one product, the PrivateEye.  That's a small cube-shaped device that the user straps aroundthe head similar to a sweat band.  There is a boom that comes fromthe side on which the device is mounted so that it is positionedin front of the user's eye.The Private Eye we had here for evaluation was Hercules-MDAcompatible.  The innards are a row (~400 LEDs) that are swept upand down by a galvonometer-like movement.  The result is that thesweeping LED bar forms a fused raster.  There is a virtual imageprojected in front of the user that the visual system tends to fusewith the background.I didn't like the device very much.  I found it easiest to use if Ilooked at a blank white wall.  I had problems with focus trackingif I glanced down to look at my keyboard for an out-of-the-way key.The unit also emitted a soft buzz and vibration which I foundannoying.  Some people didn't seem to mind the buzz.  Properlyused, however, the image clarity was quite crisp.I don't know if the company has taken the technology any further inthe last year or two, but it did seem to have promise.",4

"Archive-Name: rec-autos/part6[New article as of 4 February 1993 -- rpw]Many people want to set up mailing lists for their favoriteautomotive topics; rather fewer know how to do it.  This articlewill provide the essential information for doing so on standardUnix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setupsare included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.comfor a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotivemailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I canlist it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of theUsenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)First of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin,or 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is alsoimportant that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seemslike you get everything several days after anyone else, or that youhave trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity isprobably not good enough.Listserv:There is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, whichis available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details ofthe installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of thisarticle, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list shouldprobably  look at listserv carefully.The Alias file:On a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases onwhichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as:foo:   bar, baz, bletchwhich means that any email sent the name `foo' on that host isredistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplestpossible email list is my-favorite-car:  member1, member2, member3, my-addressmy-favorite-car-request: my-addressthis has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being thatyou have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you cando the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin:my-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-listmy-favorite-car-request: my-addressWhere the file specified is a list of comma and newline separatedaddresses.  This file can be in the list admin's home directory,owned by the list admin.Bounced Mail:this still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all themembers of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating.Therefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set upis instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup,by the way.  I'm not sure where he got it from.)school-request:   weltyschool-rebroadcast:  :include:/home/newwelty/misc/autos/school/listschool: ""|/usr/local/adm/bin/explscript school""owner-school: school-requestowner-school-out: school-requesthere's what is going on here:the owner- and -request addresses are intended as traps for bounced mailcoming from the network.  the -request address also serves as the pointof contact for administrative duties.school is what people send mail to; instead of pointing at addresses,it points at a shell script which rewrites headers before resendingthe email.  school-broadcast (of which nobody except me knows the name;the name has been changed here to protect my own sanity) points at theactual list members.the shell script i use is as follows:-----------------#!/bin/shcd /tmpsed -e '/^Reply-To:/d' -e '/^Sender:/d' -e '/^From /d' | \        (echo Reply-To: ${1}@balltown.cma.com; \         echo Errors-To: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \         echo Sender: ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com; \         cat -) | \        /usr/lib/sendmail -om -f ${1}-request@balltown.cma.com \                -F ""The ${1} Mailing List"" ${1}-rebroadcastexit 0-------------------note that this script does not know the name of the list; the nameis passed in from outside, so that the script may be used for multiplelists (i run several out of this site.)the script excises Reply-To:, Sender:, and From lines from the incomingmessage, substitutes for Sender: and Reply-To:, and adds Errors-to:99.9% of all email bounce messages end up being sent to the -requestor owner- addresses if this header rewrite is done.For digested lists, there is some digestification software around.Hopefully I'll be able to provide more information in a future versionof this posting.richard welty (welty@balltown.cma.com)",17

Something to bear in mind is what the V in VLB stands for!V for Video - the origional intention of the bus was to speed upthe bus so that large memory to memory transfers would be faster.This is espically useful in transfering data from main memory tovideo memory.Since there are usually 3 VLB slots card makers have been making cards to fit in the other two. How about an VLB ethernet card? Move the data into the card at130 odd MB/s and then wait for it to tickle onto the net atjust over 1Mb/s.[ Do do however free the local bus for other cards ]Some times you need fast busses and sometimes you don't!Guy,13

"Pardon me for being a little confused, but at the beginning of your second paragraph, you say, ""God has one set of rules for all his people,"" yet at the end of the same paragraph you declare, ""please do not combine the ceremonial and moral laws in one.""

If it's bad to have 2 sets of laws, how can there be a ceremonial law that is different from the moral law (and vice versa)?I would also be interested in your comments on the passage in I Cor. 10:1-16, where Paul teaches different rules for covering you head while praying depending on whether you are a man or a woman.  Do you think the apostles can prescribe different sets of rules for men and women?  If so, then why not for Jews and Gentiles?

But at the time of theRenaissance and Ref ormation in Western Europe man became the centre,or the focus of culture (hence ""humanism""). This consciousness wasalso secular, in the sense that it was concerned primarily with thepresent age, r ather than the age to come. Capitalism arose at thesame time, and the power of economics became central in philosophy.This doesn't mean that economics did not exist before, simply that itbegan to dominate the conscious cultural values of Western Europeansociety and its offshoots. This cultural shift was, in its laterstages, accompanied by industrial revolutions and the values thatjustified them.There was a fundamental cultural shift in the meaning of ""economics"" -from the Christian view of man as the economos, the steward, ofcreation to the secular idea of man as the slave of economic forcesand powers. There were denominational differences among the newworshippers of Mammon. For some the name of the deity was ""the freerein of the market mechanism"", while for others it was ""thedialectical forces of history"". But in both the capitalist West andthe socialist East the environment was sacrificed on the altar ofMammon.

"Rob Butera asks about a book called THE LOST YEARS OF JESUS, byElizabeth Clare Prophet.I do not know the book.

Amajor tenet of the movement is that there is a monastery in themountains of Tibet from which a monk descends to the lower altitudesevery few centuries to preach, and that all major religions havebeen founded by monks from this monastery.

"The Bible does tell us that governments are ordained by God (Romans 13). And furthermore, God foreknows everything that would happen.  It isjust to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds, theinevitablity of the sucess of God's plan, and this is especially hard tograsp when we see governemnts doing evil.  However, though they aredoing evil (and we should not cooperate with them when they do such), itmust be understood that what happens is what God wanted so as to lead tothe final sucess of His plan to save as many souls from hell as ispossible.  In short, the slaughter in Bosnia, though deplorable in theeyes of God (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just desertsnow rather than later; there are plenty of examples of God killingpeople for their sins - Onan in the Old Testmament for example, andAnnias and Spahira in the New) is what he willed to happen so that Hisplan might be accomplished.    But don't forget, it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation toexecute His just judgement upon another.  The Romans were used tofulfill the chorus of ""Let his blood be upon our hands"" of the crowd inJersualem.  And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon, which got Israel,which was inturn gotten by Persia, etc.  God does use nations to punishother nations, as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament. Don't you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel, ""Mene, mene,tekel, peres?""  Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God'sjustice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the Persiansas their due punishment for their rebellion.  Another exammple is theextirmination of the Cannanites, ordered by God as the task of Israel. The Cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, andthe Great Judge, carried out His just sentence accrodingly.  I could goon with more examples, but I see little need to do so, as my point isquite clear.Two things need to be remembered at all times. 1) It is not up to us toquestion why God has ordered the world as He has.  In His divine Wisdom,He made the world as was best in His eyes, and like Paul says in Romans9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter.  2) The message ofJesus Christ is as follows: ""Repent now, for the Kingdom of Heaven is athand.""  Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - ""Letthe dead bury the dead, come, follow me.""  There is not an infiniteamount of time, rather Christ is passing by right now, calling people tofollow Him and become fishers of men.  He does not say, ""well, alright,you can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with yourplans.""  He said ""Follow me.""  His message is NOT ""I'm just a sweety-piewho would never hurt a fly, you've got all the time in the world, andDivine Judgement, that's only a fairy tale.""  ""Our great God and Savior""Jesus Christ (Titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous Judge of theworld.  And it is not up to the defendants in the trial to bequestioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy.",7

"Misinterpretation, though it should be a crime in itself, is whatUnited States lawyers use to make their bread and butter.

The judge took the twowords from this law, completely out of context, and ruled thatLaserGames could not operate in Manchester.

"""fete""??? Since this word both formally and commonly refers topositive/joyous events, your misuse of it here is rather unsettling. I certainly abhor those Israeli policies and attitudes that areabusive towards the Palestinians/Gazans. Given that, however, there *is no comparison* between the reality of the Warsaw Ghetto and in Gaza.  Just as international law recognizes the right of the occupying entity to maintain order, especially in the face of elementsthat are consciously attempting to disrupt the civil structure. Ironically, international law recognizes each of these focusses(that of the occupied and the occupier) even though they are inherently in conflict.Israel certainly cannot, and should not, continue its presentpolicies towards Gazan residents. There is, however, a third alternative- the creation and implementation of a jewish ""dhimmi""system with Gazans/Palestinians as benignly ""protected"" citizens.Would you find THAT as acceptable in that form as you do withregard to Islam's policies towards its minorities? It is a race, then? Between Israel's anti-Palestinian/Gazan""Final Solution"" and the Arab World's anti-Israel/jewish""Final Solution"". Do you favor one? neither? Since there is justifiable worry by various parties that Israeland Arab/Palestinian ""final solution"" intentions exist, isn't itimportant that BOTH Israeli *and* Palestinian/Gazan ""rights""be secured?",9
"Approximately four months ago, I purchased a Quantum 240LPS HD from La Cie for$649. After two months, the drive started having problems. First, there wereintermittent freezes, then corrupted files and resources, then Silverlining5.41 wouldn't even recognize the drive. So I got an RMA from La Cie andexchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one.Well, about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems.Often, when I boot up my IIsi I get the flashing question mark. Sometimes, if Ithen insert the Silverlining (5.42) program I can get it to recognize the driveby making it scan over and over for drives. At that point I can restart theIIsi and boot from the HD. I've called La Cie again and they've given meanother RMA. Their tech support people tell me that if Silverlining doesn't seethe drive there's a definite hardware problem.Given that this is the second bad drive in four months, I asked La Cie to sendme a *new* one, but they said ""no."" Also, within three weeks after I purchasedmy original drive, La Cie dropped the price on it by over $100.I can accept that a drive (or two) may be bad. And I know that hardware vendorsmake a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs. AndI understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to suddenprice fluctuations. Nevertheless, taken together, the convergence of thesefacts/events have left a bad taste in my mouth. (I should have added above thatwhen I asked La Cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the onethey will send_I think the data is still in good shape and I'll have to againreinstall everything from floppies_they said it would cost me $250 for datarecovery.)It seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at adiscounted price, and that replacements for new hardware gone bad (stillcovered under a 90-day warranty) should be new. I feel a little helpless about all this. I don't mean to necessarily flame LaCie_their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful.But c'mon.

(I senta letter to La Cie's customer service when the first drive was returned and Iasked them for a credit on the price difference since I had purchased the drivethree weeks before they slashed the price. I told them I would like to applythe credit toward the purchase of another La Cie product. They didn't even have the courtesy to reply one way or the other.)What's the moral of this story? I'm not sure. But I do know I won't buy anyother products from La Cie in the future.Bill Krauthammerf2ehg786@umiami.ir.miami.edu",14
"	I think this kind of comparison is pretty useless in general.  Theprocessor is only good when a good computer is designed around it adn thecomputer is used in its designed purpose.  Comparing processor speed ispretty dumb because all you have to do is just increase the clock speedto increase speed among other things.	I mean how can you say a 040 is faster than a 486 without giving is operational conditions?  Can you say the same when you are running a program that uses a lot of transidental functions.Knowing that 040 does not have transidental functions building in to its FPU and 486 does, can you say that 040 is still faster?	Anyway, I hope people do not decided upon wether a computersis good or not solely on its processor.  Or how fast a processor isbased on its name, because one can alway do a certain things to aprocessor to speed it up.  	But if we restrict our arguements to, for example, pureprocessor architectural issues.  Or how one processor will workwell and another will not based on its design, then we can getsomewhere with our discussions.  - Chung Yang",14

"THE WHITE HOUSE                  Office of the Press Secretary                  (Vancouver, British Columbia)_________________________________________________________________For Immediate Release                               April 4, 1993	                     PRESS CONFERENCE BY THE PRESIDENT                        WITH RUSSIAN PRESS	                                Canada Place                   Vancouver, British Columbia2:46 P.M. PDT	     	  	     Q	  I had two questions for both Presidents, so you could probably answer for Boris, too.  (Laughter.)	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll give you my answer, then I'll give you Yeltsin's answer.  (Laughter.)	     	     Q	  The first is that this is the meeting of the Presidents, so the money that's being promised is government money, and naturally it's going to be distributed through the government.  But you've indicated that three-quarters are going to be going to businesses.  So the question is how the Russian businesses themselves are going to be consulted, if ever?  What are the priorities, because there are several association of Russian businessmen existing already, so will they be invited to participate in setting up priorities for investment?  	     	     This is the first.  And second, to you.  We know that polls, public polls in America do not show that Americans are very enthusiastic about giving this aid.  Like Newsweek polls say that about 75 percent don't approve it, and New York Times published that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war; 42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent if it just personally supports Yeltsin.  How are you going to sort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not very enthusiastic?  Thank you.	     	     Q	  I have a question, I'm sorry -- is there going to be a translation of everything into Russian?  No, just the answers.  Just the answers.  Okay.	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  The answer to the first question is, it depends on what kind of aid we're discussing.  For example, the funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will obviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be good risks and make the application.  The privatization fund will be used to support the privatization of existing public enterprises.  Then there are some other general funds in the Democracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have some influence over the distribution of.  	     	     With regard to your second question, let me say that I would think that there would be people in both countries who would not feel too warmly toward simply the American government giving money to the Russian government.  There's opposition to that in Russia.  And in our country, throughout our whole history there has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds.  That is, this has nothing to do with Russia.  If you look at the whole history of America, any kind of aid program has always been unpopular.  	     	     What I have tried to tell the American people is, is this is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that this is an investment in our future.  We spent $4 trillion --trillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments because of the Cold War.  Now, with a democratic government in Russia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them working on a democracy and struggling to get their economies going, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it possible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the economy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and investment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce nuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on our side and on the Russian side.  	     	     So I don't see this as an aid program; this is an investment for the United States.  This is very much in the interest of the United States.  The things I announced today, the second stage of the program, which I hope to put together next week, in my view are things that are good for my country and for the taxpayers and workers of my country.  	     	     Russia is a very great nation that needs some partnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share her goals.  But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view this as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue.  That's not what it is, it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful investment.  	     	     Like all investments, there is some risk.  But there's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than the $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier of the Cold War.	     	     Q	  Mr. President, first of all thank you very much, indeed, for coming here and talking to us.  In the memory of the living correspondents, this is the first time an American President is doing this to the Russian press corps, so it's kind of a very measured breakthrough.  	     	     I have two questions.  One, in your introductory remarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief that you discussed the START II and START I issues.  Could you tell us:  Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to what might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification of START I and the NPT regime?  And my second question is, how confident you are that the United States Congress would be eager to support you in lifting Jackson-Vanik and other restrictions inherited from the Cold War?  	     	     PRESIDENT CLINTON:  First, we discussed the issue of Ukraine with regard to START I and NPT, and generally, with regard to the need to proceed to have the other independent states all be non-nuclear; but also to have the United States develop strong relationships with them.  We know that one thing that we could do that would increase, I think, the willingness of the Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude our own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that would provide not only an important economic opportunity for Russia, but also for Ukraine, and it would show some reaching out on our part.  But we agreed that basically the people who signed off on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did, and we agreed to continue to press that.	     	     I, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to reassure Ukraine's leaders, specifically the President and the Foreign Minister, that I want strong ties with Ukraine, that the United States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine, but that, in order to do what we need to do together to strengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States be fully supportive, the commitment to ratify START I and to join the NPT regime is critical.	     	     What was the second question?  	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  With regard to Jackson-Vanik and COCOM, I would make two points:  First, I have agreed with the Republican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will, as soon as I return, have a list of all the legislative and other restrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on relations between the United States and Russia, that are legacies of the Cold War.  And we will see whether they're -- how many of them we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the leadership of the Congress.	     	     With regard to Jackson-Vanik, I think there will be an openness to change the law if the Congress is convinced there are, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to emigrate who are not being allowed to.  If the fact is that there is no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed to affect, then I think that the desire to keep the law will be much less.	     	     With regard to COCOM, my guess is, and it's nothing more than a guess, that the leadership of Congress and indeed my own advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement out of the COCOM regime.  But I think they would be willing to begin it in the fairly near future.	     	     Q	  Mr. Clinton, when I read your speech in Annapolis, I got the impression that you have a completely different personal -- and I stress that -- personal, not political approach towards Russia, compared to the approach of Mr. Bush.  Could you formulate in a few words, what is the difference between you as a personality and your approach -- the difference between your approach to Russia and the approach of Mr. Bush?  And who made you -- why did you cite Akhmatova in the last part of your speech?	     	     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me say, first, I do not wish to compare myself with President Bush or anyone else.  I can't say what was in his heart about Russia.  I can say that since I was a boy, I have been personally fascinated with the history, the music and the culture, and the literature of Russia.  I have been thrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music for more than 30 years now.  I have read major Russian novelists and many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know as much as I could about your history.  	     	     And I went to the Soviet Union -- but it was then the Soviet Union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last presidential campaign that I spent the first week of 1970 alone in Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr. Yeltsin was elected President.  But all that time I was away, I was following events there very closely and hoping for the day when we could be genuine partners.  So I have always had a personal feeling about Russia.  	     	     I remember, for example -- a lot of you know I like music very much.  One of the most moving experiences for me as a musician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York Philharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony to the Russians.  And he played the last movement more rapidly than anyone had ever played it before because it was technically so difficult.  That is something I followed very closely when it occurred.  	     	     These are things that have always had a big impact on my life.  And I had just always hoped that someday, if I ever had the chance to, I could play a role in seeing our two countries become closer partners.  (Applause.)	     	     THE PRESS:  Thank you.",10

"Except for their size, the cooling towers on nuclear power plantsare vertually identical in construction and operation to coolingtowers designed and built in the 1890's (a hundred years ago) forcoal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric railways.Basicly, the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft whenits air is heated by hot water and/or steam circulating thru a networkof pipes that fill about the lower 1/3 of the tower. To assist coolingand the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over thehot pipes. The cold water evaporates, removing the heat faster thanjust air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor israpidly carried away by the draft. This produces the clouds frequentlyseen rising out of these towers.That slight pinch (maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower) is there becauseit produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate ofthe air draft produced, compared to a straight cylinder shape.The towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steamsystem of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to theboiler and used again. The wider the temperature difference acrossthe turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are andby recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending itback to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference(sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage ""hot""turbine to final stage ""cold"" turbine).

"I deleted much of the following article in order to discuss the specific issue of whether it is acceptable to divorce.  I have thought about the implications, and it is scary.  We have a whole generation of families broken up because some men have decided that is is okay to leave their wives and children for thethrill of a younger, more attractive woman.  If we accept that it islegitimate for Jane to have divorced, how can we not accept anyone'sdecision to divorce because he has found someone with whom he canhave a more ""deep, committed relationship.""Marriage is not a state of being, it is a mutual journey in life.Love is not a passive feeling, it must be actively willed.Is it acceptable for an older executive to dump his wife of many years who stayed home to care for the children because hecan't be happy sexually unless he is with a beautifulyoung blonde?

"In <1993Apr15.045651.6892@midway.uchicago.edu>, thf2@midway.uchicago.edu sez:Even if Brett's eventual-return figures were correct -- and theyclearly weren't -- he'd still be wrong about the cause for the '86blip because he fails to consider 2 basic factors:1) As Ted notes, not everyone is a long-term investor.  One might findoneself, as I did in late 1986, anticipating expenses in the near termthat require selling off holdings.  Given the choice between waiting afew weeks (and taking an extra tax hit) or selling in December withpreferential tax treatment, only a fool would choose the former.2) The fact that Brett can now construct _post hoc_ calculations ofwhat would have been more beneficial to investors is in many respectsbeside the point.  There was plenty of _Money_-style advice given tounsophisticated investors in late 1986 to ""sell now and save ontaxes.""  In case anyone missed it, there was no shortage of similaradvice late last year (in the NYTimes, e.g.), even though that advicewas based not on the foregone conclusion of enacted law (as in 1986),but merely on the *assumption* that Clinton would raise tax rates(without capping CG taxes, contrary to the current proposal).It's nice to think that investors always behave in their optimaleconomic interest.  Like assuming weightless ropes and frictionlesspulleys, though, this sort of thinking often fails to describeaccurately what happens in the real world.",10

"Ever since the siege at Waco started the FBI spokesman has beenstressing how unstable and paranoid David Koresh was.  He stressed howlikely it was the the Branch Davidians would commit mass suicide.  Hewas concerned with the safety of the children. What did the FBI do to defuse the situation,  Did they try to reassureKoresh?  DId the FBI offer medical assistance to the BD?  Did the FBIoffer them a supply of water when the BD pump stoped working?  Did thepermit Koresh to communicate with anyone outside the compound? What the FBI did was harass the Branch Davidians as much as possible.They kept powerful lights shining on the compound, shut off theirelectrical power, put their pump out of action, assaulted their earswith loud noise, cut off their communication with the outside and keptlimiting their permitter.  The stated goal was to put pressure onDavid Koresh. Was the FBI attempting to get Koresh to surrender or were they hopingto get Koresh so mad that he and some of his followers would attackthe the tanks. It appears that the tactics employed by the FBI did drive Koresh overthe edge.  The blame for the deaths should be shared by both thefederal experts whose tactics drove Koresh over the edge and the foolsat the ATF who planed the raid.

"	Why do we follow God so blindly?  Have you ever asked aphysically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog?The answer is quite simple--the dog can see, and the blind personcannot.	I acknowledge, as a Christian, that I am blind.  I see,but I see  illusions as well as reality.  (Watched TV lately?)I hear, but I hear lies as well as truth.  (Listen to your radio or read a newspaper.)  Remember, all that tastes well isnot healthy.  So, I rely one the one who can see, hear, andtaste everything, and knows what is real, and what is not.That is God.	Of course, you may ask, if I cannot trust my own senses,how do I know whether what I see and hear about God is truth ora lie.  That is why we need faith to be saved.  We must forceourselves to believe that God knows the truth, and loves usenough to share it with us, even when it defies what we thinkwe know.  Why would He have created us if He did not love us enough to help us through this world?	I also do trust my experiences to some extent.  WhenI do things that defy the seeming logic of my experience, because it is what my Father commands me to do, and I seethe results in the long term, I find that He has led mein the proper direction, even though it did not feel rightat the time.  This is where our works as Christians areimportant:  As exercises of the body make the body strong,excercises of faith make the faith strong.  	As for you, no one can ""convert"" you.  You mustchoose to follow God of your own will, if you are ever tofollow Him.  All we as Christians wish to do is share withyou the love we have received from God.  If you reject that,we have to accept your decision, although we always keepthe offer open to you.  If you really want to find outwhy we believe what we believe, I can only suggest you trypraying for faith, reading the Bible, and asking Christiansabout their experiences personally.  Then you may grow tounderstand why we believe what we do, in defiance of thelogic of this world.	May the Lord bring peace to you, ",7

"/(emery)/The one single historic event that has had the biggest impact on the/world over the centuries is the resurrection of Jesus.  This is hardly possible, as the majority of people in the world wereborn, lived their life, and died, without ever knowing anything aboutChrist.  The majority of the rest of the world have decided that he is not who Emery thinks he is./(emery)/Why were the writers of the New Testament documents so convinced that/Jesus really did rise from the dead?/We have four gospel accounts.  I am leaving out all ""proofs"" of Emery's which rely on quoting thebible as proof.  Circular reasoning, etc.  There have been occasionsalready stated many times for later generations of Xtians to change,edit, or otherwise alter the bible to fit their political gospel.And if we accept the bible as true just because the bible says itis true, then (to be fair) we have to do the same to the Bhagavad-Gitaand the Koran, both of which contradict the bible.Enough said./(emery)/Yet we have no reason to believe these disciples to be immoral and dishonest./We have no historic information that would lead us to the conclusion that/these people were not God-fearing people who sincerely and whole-heartedly/believed that the resurrection of their Lord Jesus was a real event./And for what gain would they lie?  To make a stand at that time meant /persecution, imprisonment, and perhaps even death.Again, this is only the biblical account and there is no independent proofof any of this happening.  It just isn't there.Besides, simply being sincere or willing to die for your faith does notmake your faith correct.  There are Muslims dying in Bosnia right now;does the fact that they are willing to die for Islam mean that Islam isthe correct religion?(emery)/History bears out the persecution of Christians.  Roman historian, Cornelius /Tacitus, Govenor of Asia, in A.D. 112, writing of Nero's reign, alluded to /the torture of Christians in Rome:All you have proven is that these people were tortured for their faith.  Thatdoes not prove that their faith is true or correct; it just means that theywere sincere in their beliefs. Being willing to die for what you believe doesn't make your belief the truth.It's not that easy.  And minority religions have always suffered torture;Muslims suffer torture and harassment in India and Bosnia today.  All religionsare harassed in China today.  You haven't proven anything so far./(emery)/With all the suffering and persecution that it meant to be a believer, it/would be quite probable that at least one of those in the supposed conspiracy/would come forward and confess that the whole thing was a big hoax.  Not if they didn't believe that it was a hoax.  /(emery)/Yet not one did.  It seems rather reasonable that the disciples did not make/up the resurrection but sincerely believed that Jesus had actually risen/from the dead; especially in light of the sufferings that came upon those/who believed.The followers of Muhammad firmly believed in the miracles that the Koransays Muhammad performed.  They were attacked and slaughtered for theirbeliefs.  They didn't denounce Muhammad or Islam.  If you are correct,then that means Islam is the true faith.",11
"From another space forum    When workers at the Kennedy Space Center disassembled the STS-56 solid rocket boosters they were surprised to find a pair of pliers lodged into the outside base of the right hand SRB.  The tool survived the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a 250,000 foot altitude, then down to splashdown and towing back to KSC.    NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone told the media,    ""It's been a long time since something like this happened.  We've lost washers and bolts (before) but never a tool like this.""    The initial investigation into the incident has shown that a Thiokol Corp. technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on April 2nd.  Unfortunately, the worker's supervisor did not act on the report and Discovery was launched with its ""extra payload"".  NASA officials were never told of the missing tool before the April 8th launch date.    The free-flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB technician.  When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster, its 18-inch long rope was still attached.  The pliers were found in a part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad.    A spokesperson for the Lockheed Space Operations Company said that the Shuttle processor will take ""appropriate action"".  Thiokol is a subcontractor to LSOC for work to prepare Shuttle hardware for launch._________________________________________________________Karl Anderson	DEV/2000: Configuration Management/Version ControlDept 53K/006-2		Rochester, Minnesota 55901253-8044		Tie 8-453-8044INTERNET: karl@vnet.ibm.comPRODIGY: CMMG96A",6

They left and I had an attack. I realized that the dan-ger was past, and stopped controlling myself. I relaxed for a moment and the physical pain immediately made itself felt. My heart and kidneys hurt. I had an awful kidney attack. I rolled back and forth on top of those Christmasornaments, howling and howling. I didn't know where I was or how long this went on. When we figured out the time, later it turned out that I howled and was in pain for around an hour. Then all my strength was gone and I burst intotears, I started feeling sorry for myself, and so on and so forth . . .Then someone came into the room. I think I hear someone calling my name. I want to respond and restrain myself, I think that I'm hallucinating. I am silent, and then it continues: it seems that first a man's voice is callingme, then a woman's. Later I found out that Mamma had sent our neighbor, theone whose apartment she was hiding in, Uncle Sabir Kasumov, to our place, telling him, ""I know that they've killed Lyuda. Go there and at least bring her corpse to me so they don't violate her corpse."" He went and returned emptyhanded, but Mamma thought he just didn't want to carry the corpse into his apartment. She sent him another time, and then sent his wife, and they were walking through the rooms looking for me, but I didn't answer their calls. There was no light, they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps.They started the pogrom in our apartment around five o'clock, and at 9:30 I went down to the Kasumovs'. I went down the stairs myself. I walked out of theapartment: how long can you wait for your own death, how long can you be cowardly, afraid? Come what will. I walked out and started knocking on the doors one after the next. No one, not on the fifth floor, not on the fourth, opened the door. On the third floor, on the landing of the stairway, Uncle Sabir's son started to shout, ""Aunt Roza, don't cry, Lyuda's alive!"" He knocked on his own door and out came Aunt Tanya, Igor, and after them, Mamma. Aunt Tanya, Uncle Sabir's wife, is an Urdmurt. All of us were in their apartment. I didn't see Karina, but she was in their home, too, Lyingdelirious, she had a fever. Marina was there too, and my father and mother.All of my family had gathered there.   At the door I lost consciousness. Igor and Aunt Tanya carried me into theapartment.Later I found out what they had done to our Karina. Mamma said, ""Lyuda, Karina's in really serious condition, she's probably dying. If she recognizes you, don't cry, don't tell her that her face looks so awful."" It was as thoughher whole face was paralyzed, you know, everything was pushed over to one side, her eye was all swollen, and everything flowed together, her lips, her cheeks . . . It was as though they had dragged her right side around the wholemicrodistrict, that's how disfigured her face was. I said, ""Fine."" Mamma was afraid to go into the room, because she went in and hugged Karina and started to cry. I went in. As soon as I saw her my legs gave way. I fell down near thebed, hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying. She opened the eye that was intact, looked at me, and said, ""Who is it?"" But I could barely talk, my whole face was so badly beaten. I didn't say, but rather muttered somethingtender, something incomprehensible, but tender, ""My Karochka, my Karina, my little golden one . . . "" She understood me.Then Igor brought me some water, I drank it down and moistened Karina's lips. She started to groan. She was saying something to me, but I couldn't understand it. Then I made out, ""It hurts, I hurt all over."" Her hair was glued down with blood. I stroked her forehead, her head, she had grit on her forehead, and on her lips . . . She was groaning again, and I don't know how to help her. She calls me over with her hand, come closer. I go to her. She'ssaying something to me, but I can't understand her. Igor brings her a pencil and paper and says, ""Write it down."" She shakes her head as if to say, no, I can't write. I can't understand what she's saying. She wanted to tell me something, but she couldn't. I say, ""Karina, just lie there a little while,then maybe you'll feel better and you can tell me then."" And then she says,""Maybe it'll be too late."" And I completely . . . just broke down, I couldn'tcontrol myself.Then I moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye. I dippeda handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips. She says, ""Lyuda, we're not saved yet, we have to go somewhere else. Out of this damned house. They want to kill us, I know. They'll find us here, too. We needto call Urshan."" She repeated this to me for almost a whole hour, Until I understood her every word. I ask, ""What's his number?"" Urshan Feyruzovich, that's the head of the administration where she works. ""We have to call him."" But I didn't know his home number. I say, ""Karina, what's his number?"" She says, ""I can't remember."" I say, ""Who knows his number? Who can I call?"" She says, ""I don't know anything, leave me alone.""I went out of the room. Igor stayed to watch over her and sat there, he was crying, too. I say, ""Mamma, Karina says that we have to call Urshan. How can we call him? Who knows his telephone number?"" I tell Marina, ""Think, think, who can we call to find out?"" She started calling; several people didn't answer. She called a girlfriend, her girlfriend called another girlfriend and found out the number and called us back. The boss's wife answered and said he was at the dacha. My voice keeps cracking, I can't talk normally. She says, ""Lyuda, don't panic, get a hold of yourself, go out to those hooligans and tell them that they just can't do that."" She still didn't know what was reallygoing on. I said, ""It's easy for you to say that, you don't understand what's happening. They are killing people here. I don't think there is a single Armenian left in the building, they've cut them all up. I'm even surprised that we managed to save ourselves. ""She says, ""Well, OK, if it's that serious . . . "" And all the same she's thinking that my emotions are all churned up and that I'm fearing for my life, that in fact it's not all that bad. ""OK, fine, fine,"" she says, ""if you're afraid, OK, as soon as Urshan comes back I'll send him over.""We called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly under Aunt Tanya's, on the second floor, Asya Dallakian's apartment. She wasn't home, she was staying with her daughter in Karabagh. They destroyed everything there . . . We realized that they still might come back. We kept ontrying to get through to Aunt Tanya--Urshan's wife is named Tanya too and finally we get through. She says, ""Yes, he's come home, he's leaving for your place now."" He came. Of course he didn't know what was happening, either, because he brought two of his daughters with him. He came over in his jeep with his two daughters, like he was going on an outing. He came and saw what shape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened. He has grown up daughters, they're almost my age.The three of us carried out Karina, tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf, andwent down to his car. He took Karina and me to the Maternity Home. . . No, first they took us to the po]ice precinct. They had stretchers ready. Assoon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and saidthat we were in serious condition and that we mustn't move, we might havefractures. From the stretcher I saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on thefirst floor, bandaged, on the concrete floor, groaning . . . This was aroundeleven o'clock at night. We had left the house somewhere around 1:30. When I saw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on: soldiers, enemies. . . everything just like a war.They carried me into some office on the stretcher. The emergency medicalpeople from Baku were there. The medical attendant there was an older Armenian. Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she's so proud she would never have told. And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle Arkady, I think, because someone said ""Arkady, get an injection ready,"" he started to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But when he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man, in his sixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. He hugged Karina and started to cry: ""What have they done to you?!"" He was speaking Armenian. ""Whathave they done to you?!"" Karina didn't say anything. Mamma came in then, and she started to cry, too. The man tried to calm her. ""I'll give you a shot."" Mamma tells him, ""I don't need any shot. Where is the government? Just what are they doing? Look what they've done to my children! They're killing people,and you're just sitting here!"" Some teacups were standing on the table in there. ""You're sitting here drinking tea! Look what they've done to my daughters! Look what they've turned them into!"" They gave her something to drink, some heart medicine, I think. They gave Karina an injection and thedoctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa and Urshan, I think, even though Papa was in bad shape, helped carry Karina out. When they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. I don't know, maybe there weren't any orderlies. Then they came to me: ""What's the matter with you?"" Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighterin the half-length coat. I had a blanket on, too, an orange one, Aunt Tanya's.I said, ""I'm fine."" Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told the doctor, ""You leave, let a woman examine her."" A woman came, an Azerbaijani, I believe, and said, ""What's wrong with you?"" I was wearing my sister Lyuda's nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When she was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would be easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showedher. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge wound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the Indian vase. She said something to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be dressed with something, but that they'd do that in the hospital.They put me on a stretcher, too. They started looking for people to carry me. I raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, I don't know if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, ""Lie still, you mustn't move."" WhenI was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed very familiar to me. I shouted, ""Stop!"" One of the policemen turned and says, ""What do you want?"" I say, ""Bring him to me, I want to look at him."" They brought him over and I said, ""That person was just in our apartment and he just raped me and my sister. I recognize him, note it down."" They said, ""Fine,"" but didn't write it down and led him on. I don't know where they were taking him.Then they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were sitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car up closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me, ""Sister . . . "" I don't remember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what theydid to us. I asked him, ""Where are you from?"" He said that he was from Ufa. Apparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I learned that they suffered most of all. He says, ""OK, you're Armenians, they didn't get along with you, but I'm a Russian,"" he says, ""what are they trying to kill me for?"" Oh, I remembered something else. When I went out onto the balcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw two Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed against the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating himwith his own club. The way he cried ""Mamma"" made my skin crawl. I don't know what they did to him, if he's still alive or not. And something else. Before he attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from thethird or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but I didn't think it was Azerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or theywere throwing something they didn't need out, or someone was fighting with someone. It was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the yard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians, thatI realized that this was serious, that it was anti-Armenian.They took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too and said, ""I've been beaten too, help me."" But they just ignored her. My father went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault that he'd been beaten, and says, ""My ribs hurt so much, those creeps have probably broken my ribs. Please look at them."" The doctor says, ""That's not myjob."" Urshan said, ""Fine, I'll take you to my place and if we need a doctor, I'll find you one. I'll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them to his apartment.Marina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the doctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I wasn't surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but I was verysurprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken theHippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that. By happy--or unhappy--coincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina. And she,having examined Karina, said, ""No problem, you got off pretty good. Not like they did in Kafan, when you Armenians were killing and raping our women.""Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn't say anything--shewould certainly have had something to say! Then they examined me. The same story. They put us in a separate ward. No shots, no medicinal powders, no drugs. Absolutely none! They didn't even give us tea. All the women there soonfound out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped. Andthey started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at zoo animals. Karina didn't see this, she was lying there, and I kept her from seeing it.They put Ira B. in our ward. She had also been raped. True, she didn't have any serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their place, I felt worse for them than I did for us. Because when they raped Ira her daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. AndIra was holding her daughter's hand, the one who was hiding under the bed.When they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she involuntarily let go of her daughter's hand, her daughter took her hand again.Her daughter is in the fourth grade, she's 11 years old. I felt really awful when I heard that. Ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, ""Do whatyou want with me, just leave my daughter alone."" Well, they did what they wanted. They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. Now I would be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. It was simply Bartholomew's Night, I say, they did what they would love to do every day: steal, kill, rape . . .Many are surprised that those animals didn't harm the children. The beasts explained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those children would be grown, and then, as they put it, ""we'll come take the pleasure out of their lives, those children."" This was about the girls thatwould be young women in 15 years. They were thinking about their tomorrow because they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, justas there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be of some use in 15 years. This I heard from the investigators; one of the victims testified to it. That's how they described their own natures, thatthey would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--theythemselves said that.And this, too. Everyone is surprised that they didn't harm our Marina. Many people say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. I don't know why their eyes were red. Maybe because they hadn't slept the night before, maybe for some other reason, I don't know. But they hadn't been smoking and they weren't drunk, I'm positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at nothing he has the urge to do. And they spoke in a cultured fashion with Marina: ""Little sister, don't be afraid, we won't harm you, don't look over there [where I was], you might be frightened. You're a Muslim, a Muslim woman shouldn't see such things."" So they were really quite sober . . .So we came out of that story alive. Each every day we have lived since it all happened bears the mark of that day. It wasn't even a day, of those several hours. Father still can't look us in the eyes. He still feels guilty for whathappened to Karina, Mother, and me. Because of his nerves he's started talk-ing to himself, I've heard him argue with himself several times when hethought no one is listening: ""Listen,"" he'll say, ""what could I do? What couldI do alone, how could I protect them?"" I don't know where to find the words,it's not that I'm happy, but I am glad that he didn't see it all happen. That's the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. Of course he knows it all, but there's no way you could imagine every last detailof what happened. And there were so many conversations: Karina and I spoketogether in private, and we talked with Mamma, too. But Father was neverpresent at those conversations. We spare him that, if you can say that. Andwhen the investigator comes to the house, we don't speak with Father present.On February 29, the next clay, Karina and I were discharged from the hospital.First they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city, the soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier. There were many people there, Armenian victims. I met the Tovmasian family there. From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died. They were sure that both had died. They were talking to me and Raya, Rafik's wife and Grant's daughter, and her mother, were both crying.Then they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard.There's a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area.They took us in there. The women were afraid to go because they thoughtthat they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had becomeso dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide.The women were shouting. They explained to them: ""We want to hide youbetter because it's possible there will be an attack on the police precinct.""We went into the little house. There were no chairs or tables in there. Wehad children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to have their diapers changed. No one had anything with them. It was just awful. They kept us there for 24 hours. From the window of the one room house you could see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the police precinct, as though they were spying on us. The police precinct is surrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it's electrified, but if they were standing on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. This brought great psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn't just walked out of their apartments, but who hadn't slept for 24 hours, or 48,or those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost family members. For us it was another ordeal. We were especially frightened when all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. We couldn't see a singleperson, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. We thought that they musthave already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret room down there. People were panicking: they started throwing themselves atone another . . . That's the way it is on a sinking ship. We heard those people, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. We felt thatthe end was approaching. I was completely terrified: I had left Karina in the hospital and didn't know where my parents were. I was sort of calm about my parents, I was thinking only about Karina, if, Heaven forbid, they should attack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an Armenian in there, and something terrible would happen to Karina again, and she wouldn't be able to take it.Then soldiers with dogs appeared. When they saw the dogs some of the people climbed down off the fence. Then they brought in about another 30 soldiers.They all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. We calmed down a little. They brought us chairs and brought the children some little cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the childrento the toilet. But we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never have occurred to any of us that we hadn't eaten for two days and that people do eat.Then, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. They were being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. One of the men came back from the courtyard and told us about it. Raya Tovmasian . . . it was like a different woman had been substituted. Earlier she had been crying, wailing, and calling out: ""Oh, Rafik!,"" but when she heard about this such a rage came over her! She jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her sleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. And suddenly there were soldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. She ran over to them. The bandits werestanding there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. She went upto one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash him! Then, on to a second, and a third. Everyone was rooted to the spot. Not one of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from doing it. And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands, muttering something. She came back and sat down, and something akin to a smileappeared on her face. She became so quiet: no tears, no cries. Then that roundwas over and she went back to beat them again. She was walking and cursing terribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the creeps, and so on. Then she came back again and sat down. She probably did this the whole night through, well, it wasn't really night, no one slept. She went five or six times and beat them and returned. And she told the women, ""What are you sitting there for? They killed your husbands and children, they raped, and you're just sitting there. You're sitting and talking as though nothing had happened. Aren't you Armenians?"" She appealed to everyone, but no one got up. I was just numb, I didn't have the strength to beat anyone, I could barely hold myself up, all the more so since I had been standing for so many hours--I was released at eleven o'clock in the morning and it was alreadyafter ten at night because there weren't enough chairs, really it was the elderly and women with children who sat. I was on my feet the whole time. There was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking. The situation was deplorable.At eleven o'clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen, Azerbaijanis. They said, ""Get up. They've brought mattresses, you can wash upand put the children to bed."" Now the women didn't want to leave this place, either. The place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with dogs. If anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, ""Oh, it's our little family,"" and things like that. The soldiers felt this love, and probably, for the first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. Everyonespoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loadedmachine guns in their hands, said, ""Grandmother, you mustn't approach me,I'm on guard."" Our people would say, ""Oh, that's all right."" They huggedthem, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. This was all terriblymoving for me. And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs.They took us up to the second floor and said, ""You can undress and sleep in here. Don't be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it's quiet in the city.""This was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41A and in otherplaces. Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at theSK club and at the City Party Committee. They took us there. On the way I asked them to stop at the Maternity Home: I wanted to take Karina with me.I didn't know what was happening there. They told me, ""Don't worry, theMaternity Home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. So you can restassured. I say, ""Well, I won't rest assured regardless, because the staff inthere is capable of anything.""When I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina hadalready been brought there. They had seen fit to release her from the hospi-tal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. Oncewe were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears. We met acquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who hadn't been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with them, and so on, and those, like me, like Raya, who were wearing whatever had come their way. There were even people who were all made up, dolled up like they had come from a wedding. There were people without shoes, naked people, hungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. And of course the stories and the talk were flying: ""Oh, I heard that they killed him!"" ""What do you mean they killed him!"" ""He stayed at work!"" ""Do you know what's happening at this and such a plant? Talk like that.And then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian, the teacher. I know him very well and respect him highly. I've known him for a long time. They had a small room, well really it was more like a study-room. We spent a whole night talking in that study once. On March 1 we heard that Bagirov [First Secretary of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] had arrived. Everyone ran to see Bagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed from outside. He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask him things. Everyone was in a tremendous rage. But he was protected by soldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn't deign to speak with the people. Apparently he had more important things to do.Several hours passed. Gukasian called me and says, ""Lyudochka, find another two or three. We're going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs, lists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people who had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned."" I had about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, ""Lyuda, your Mamma has arrived, she's looking for you, she doesn't believe that you are alive and well and that you're here."" I gave the lists to someone and asked them to continue what I was doing and went off.The list was imprecise, of course. It included Grant Adamian, Raya Tovmasian'sfather, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. There was EngelsGrigorian's father and aunt, Cherkez and Maria. The list also included the name of my girlfriend and neighbor, Zhanna Agabekian. One of the guys said that he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in frontof the Kosmos movie theater. We put her on the list too, and cried, but later it turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she hadsomehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for Krasnovodsk, where, thank God, she was alive and well. I should also say that in addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored missing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead.                                                                 3All the lists were taken to Bagirov. I don't remember how many dead were contained in the list, but it's a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple of minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. I asked, ""What's going on?"" He said, ""Lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrelsthey are! They say that they lost the list of the dead. Piotr Demichev[Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Partyof the USSR] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list tohim, so that he'd see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether itwas one or fifty."" They told him that the list had disappeared and theyshould ask everyone who hadn't left for the Khimik boarding house all overagain. There were 26 people on our second list. I think that the number 26was the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, becausethat's the list that Demichev got. I remember exactly that there were 26 people on the list, I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only a half of those that were on the first list. He said, ""Lyuda, please, try toremember at least one more."" But I couldn't remember anyone else. But therewere more than 30 dead. Of that I am certain. The government and the Procuracydon't count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people whose lives are threatened by any shock. They weren't registered as victims ofthe Sumgait tragedy. And then there may be people we didn't know. So many people left Sumgait between March 1 and 8! Most of them left for smaller townsin Russia, and especially to the Northern Caucasus, to Stavropol, and the Krasnodarsk Territory. We don't have any information on them. I know that there are people who set out for parts around Moscow. In the periodical Krestyanka [Woman Farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk cows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and I know a whole group of people went to help out. Also clearly not on our list are those people who died enteringthe city, who were burned in their cars. No one knows about them, except the Azerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. And there'smore. A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list drawn up at the Procuracy. I know of three instances for sure, and I of coursedon't know them all. I'm thinking of three women whose parents chose not to publicize what had happened, that is, they didn't take the matter to court, they simply left. But in so doing they didn't cease being victims. One of themis the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. She lived in Microdistrict No. 8, on the fifth floor. I can't tell you the building number and I don't know her name. Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in Microdistrict 1 near the gift shop. I don't know her name, she lives on the same landing as the Sumgait procurator. They beat her father, he was holding the door while his daughter hid, but he couldn't hold the door forever, and when she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors' they seized her by her braid. Like the Azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because they didn't kill anyone, they only raped them and left. And the third one . . . I don't remember who the third one was anymore.They transferred us on March 1. Karina still wasn't herself. Yes, we lived fordays in the SK, in the cultural facility, and at the Khimik. They lived there and I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn't stay with Karina; it was too difficult for me, but I was at peace: she had survived. I could already walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. Thanks to the social work I did there, I managed to persevere. Aleksandr Mikhailovich said, ""If it weren't for the work I would go insane."" He and I put ourselves in gearand took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers and free food, and we went to get them. The first days we bought everything, although we should have received it for free. They were supposed to have been dispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. Then, when we found out it was free, we went to Krayev. At the time, fortunately, you could still drop byto see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearlyvisible on our faces. Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue.On March 2 they sent two investigators to see us: Andrei Shirokov and VladimirFedorovich Bibishev. The way it worked out, in our family they had considered only Karina and me victims, maybe because she and I wound up in the hospital.Mother and Father are considered witnesses, but not victims.Shirokov was involved with Karina's case, and Bibishev, with mine. After I told him everything, he and I planned to sit down with the identikit andrecord everyone I could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind. We didn't work with the identikit until the very last day because theconditions weren't there. The investigative group worked slowly and did poor quality work solely because the situation wasn't conducive to working: there weren't enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a curfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or video cameras. I think that this was done on purpose. We're not so poor that we can't supply our investigators with all that stuff. It was done especially to draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities sawthat the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to Sumgait. And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with Bibishev, I told him myself, ""Don't you worry, if it takes us a month or two months, I'll be here. I'm not afraid, I looked death in the eyes five times inthose two days, I'll help you conduct the investigation.""He and I worked together a great deal, and I used this to shelter Karina, Igave them so much to do that for a while they didn't have the time to get toher, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her-self. She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x-rays. She couldn't eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. I didn't eatand drank virtually nothing for five days. Then, on the fifth day, when wewere in Baku already, the investigator told me, ""How long can you go on like this? Well fine, so you don't want to eat, you don't love yourself, you'renot taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see thisinvestigation through. We need you."" Then I started eating, because in fact Iwas exhausted. It wasn't enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart-ment in my mind, every day I went to the investigative solitary confinementcells and prisons. I don't know . . . we were just everywhere! Probably inevery prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells ofSumgait. At that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary confinement.Thus far I have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment. Mamma identified three, and Karina, two. The total is 36. Marina didn't identify anyone, she remembers the faces of two or three, But they weren't among the photographs of those detained. I told of the neighbor I recognized. The one who went after the axe. He still hasn't been detained, he's still on the loose. He's gone, and it's not clear if he will be found or not. I don't know his first or last name. I know which building he lived in and I know his sisters' faces. But he's not in the city. The investigators informed me that even if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will continue looking for him.The 31 people I identified are largely blue-collar workers from various plants, without education, and of the very lowest level in every respect.Mostly their ages range from 20 to 30 years; there was one who was 48. Onlyone of them was a student. He was attending the Azerbaijan Petroleum andChemical Institute in Sumgait, his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga-tor. Once, thinking that I was an employee and not a victim, she said in frontof me ""I'll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cashsimply for keeping him out of Armenia,"" that is, to keep him from landing ina prison on Armenian soil. They're all terribly afraid of that, because if theinvestigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn't confess eventhough we identified him, they tell him--in order to apply psychologicalpressure--they say, ""Fine, don't confess, just keep silent. When you're in anArmenian prison, when they find out who you are, they'll take care of youin short order."" That somehow gets to them. Many give in and start to talk.The investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entirepogrom of our apartment, as an investigative experiment. It was only thenthat I saw the way they had left our apartment. Even without knowing who was in our apartment, you could guess. They stole, for example, all the money and all the valuables, but didn't take a single book. They tore them up, burned them, poured water on them, and hacked them with axes. Only the Materialsfrom the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James Fenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohigans. Oh yes, lunch was ready, we were boiling a chicken, and there were lemons for tea on the table. After they had been in our apartment, both the chicken and the lemons were gone. That's enough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don'teven know anything about books. They didn't take a single book, but they did take worn clothing, food, and even the cheapest of the cheap, worn-out slippers.Of those whom I identified, four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait. Basically, the group that went seeking ""revenge""--let's use their word for it--was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill-seekers. I talked with one of them. He had gray eyes, and somehow against the back-drop of all that black I remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes. Besides takingpart in the pogrom of our apartment, he was also involved in the murder of Tamara Mekhtiyeva from Building 16. She was an older Armenian who had recentlyarrived from Georgia, she lived alone and did not have anyone in Sumgait. I don't know why she had a last name like that, maybe she was married to an Azerbaijani. I had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice, and know nothing about her. I do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an axe. Murdering her wasn't enough for them. They hacked her into pieces and threw them into the tub with water.I remember another guy really well too, he was also rather fair-skinned. You know, all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark, both their hair and their skin. And in contrast with them, in addition to the grey-eyed one, I remember this one fellow, the one l took to be a Lezgin. I identified him. As it turned out he was Eduard Robertovich Grigorian, bornin the city of Sumgait, and he had been convicted twice. One of our own. How did I remember him? The name Rita was tattooed on his left or right hand. I kept thinking, is that Rita or ""puma,"" which it would be if you read the word as Latin characters instead of Cyrillic, because the Cyrillic ""T"" was the one that looks like a Latin ""M."" When they led him in he sat with his hands behindhis back. This was at the confrontation. He swore on every holy book, tried toput in an Armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion, and told me that I was making a mistake, and called me ""dear sister."" He said, ""You're wrong, how could I, an Armenian, raise my hand against my own, an Armenian,"" and so on. He spoke so convincingly that even the investigator asked me, ""Lyuda, are you sure it was he?"" I told him, ""I'll tell you one moreidentifying mark. If I'm wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken. The name Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand."" He went rigid and became pale. They told him, ""Put your hands on the table."" He put his hands on thetable with the palms up. I said, ""Now turn your hands over,"" but he didn't turn his hands over. Now this infuriated me. If he had from the very startacknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn't wanted to do it, that they forced him or something else, I would have treated him somewhat differently.But he insolently stuck to his story, ""No, I did not do anything, it wasn't me."" When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on hishand. His face distorted and he whispered something wicked. I immediately flewinto a rage. There was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out of granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it. Catching myself quite by surprise, I hurled that ashtray at him. But he duckedand the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and back. And he smiled. When he smiled it provoked me further. I don't know how, but I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or strangling him; I no longer remember which. When I jumped I caught the microphone cord. The investigator was there, Tolya . . .I no longer recall hislast name, and he says, ""Lyudochka, it's a Japanese microphone! Please . . ."" And shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped. They took him away. I stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down, because we needed to go on working, I only remember Tolya telling me, ""You're some actress! What a performance!"" I said, ""Tolya, honestly . . . "" Beforehandthey would always tell me, ""Lyuda, more emotion. You speak as calmly as if nothing had happened to you."" I say, ""I don't have any more strength or emotion. All my emotions are behind me now, I no longer have the strength . . . I don't have the strength to do anything."" And he says, ""Lyuda, how wereyou able to do that?"" And when I returned to normal, drinking tea and watchingthe tape, I said, ""Can I really have jumped over that table? I never jumped that high in gym class.""So you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. Of the 36 we identified there was an Armenian, a Russian, Vadim Vorobyev, who beat Mamma, and 34 Azerbaijanis.At the second meeting with Grigorian, when he had completely confessed his guilt, he told of how on February 27 the Azerbaijanis had come knocking. Amongthem were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. They said, ""Tomorrow we're going after the Armenians. Meet us at the bus station at threeo'clock."" He said, ""No, I'm not coming."" They told him, ""If you don't come we'll kill you."" He said, ""Alright, I'll come."" And he went.They also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, Kamo Pogosian. Hehad also been in prison; I think that together they had either stolen a motorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. They called him out of his apartment and told him the same thing: ""Tomorrow we're going to getthe Armenians. Be there."" He said, ""No."" They pulled a knife on him. He said, ""I'm not going all the same."" And in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed him several times, in the stomach. He was taken to the hospital. I know he wasin the hospital in Baku, in the Republic hospital. If we had known about that we would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th.I'll return to Grigorian, what he did in our apartment. I remember that hebeat me along with all the rest. He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well. But hewas very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out forhim, too. But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burningof Shagen Sargisian. I don't know if he participated in the rapes in our apartment; I didn't see, I don't remember. But the people who were in our apartment who didn't yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did. I don't know if he confessed or not, and I myself don't recall because I blackedout very often. But I think that he didn't participate in the rape of Karinabecause he was in the apartment the whole time. When they carried her into thecourtyard, he remained in the apartment.At one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian. From herI learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is Russian, he doesn't have a father, and that he's been convicted twice. Well this will be his thirdand, I hope, last sentence. He beat his wife, she was eternally coming to workwith bruises. His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita.The others who were detained . . . well they're little beasts. You really can'tcall them beasts, they're just little beasts. They were robots carrying outsomeone else's will, because at the investigation they all said, ""I don't understand how I could have done that, I was out of my head."" But we know thatthey were won around to it and prepared for it, that's why they did it. In thename of Allah, in the name of the Koran, in the name of propagating Islam--that's holy to them--that's why they did everything they were commanded to do.Because I saw they didn't have minds of their own, I'm not talking about theirlevel of cultural sophistication or any higher values. No education, theywork, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they crowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were promised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments.So off they went. Many of them explained their participation saying, ""they promised us apartments.""Among them was one who genuinely repented. I am sure that he repented from theheart and that he just despised himself after the incident. He worked at a children's home, an Azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at the children's home too. Everything that they acquired, everything that they have they earned by their own labor, and wasn't inherited from parents or grandparents. And he said, ""I didn't need anything I just don't know . . . howI ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. I had no will of my own, I had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing."" And the whole time Ikept repeating, ""Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife right before your own eyes."" He sat there and just wailed.But that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. He performed a marvelous disappearing act, but I think that they'll get onto him, they just have to work a little, because that Vadim, that boy, according to hisgrandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how to cover his tracks. He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he knew and those he didn't, either, and other things as well, and changed himself like a chameleon so they wouldn't get onto him, but he was detained.That one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians' after Aleksandr Gambarian was murdered. He came in and said, ""Let's go, enough, you've spilledenough blood here.""Maybe Karina doesn't know this but the reason they didn't finish her off was that they were hoping to take her home with them. I heard this from Aunt Tanyaand her sons, the Kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. They liked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. When Karina came to at one point--she doesn't remember this yet, this the neighbors old me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to the entryway. They saw that she was still alive and came back, they were already at the third entryway, on their way to the Gambarians'. They came backand started beating her to finish her. If she had not come to she would have sustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. An older woman from our building, Aunt Nazan, an Azerbaijani, all but lay on top of Karina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off.The woman's grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands and led her home. She howled and cried out loudly and swore: God is on Earth, he sees everything, and He won't forgive this.There was another woman, too, Aunt Fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first floor, she's already retired. Mountain dwellers, and Azerbaijanis, too, have acustom: If men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them.But they trampled her scarf and sent her home. To trample a scarf is tantamount to trampling a woman's honor.Now that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we have gotten back to being ourselves a little, I think about how could these events that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen? How did they come about? How did it start? Could it have been avoided? Well, it's clear that without a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not have happened. All the same, I'm not afraid to say this, the Azerbaijanis,let other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their nations, let them take no offense, but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are a people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution forwhat they have done. And when the law said that they could do all that, likeunleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn't have time to do everything, they threw themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done,to snatch a bit more. The smell of the danger was already in the air onFebruary 27. You could tell that something was going to happen. And everyone who had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. Many leftfor their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just gotas far away as their legs would carry them.February 27 was a Saturday. I was teaching my third class. The director came into my classroom and said that I should let the children out, that there had been a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for a meeting at Lenin Square. Well, I excused the children, and there were few teachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or seven men. The rest had already gone home. We got to Lenin Square and there were a great many people there. This was around five-thirty or six in the evening, no later. They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and the crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. They spoke over the microphone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the driver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijanichild off the bus. The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he hadseen it himself..The crowd started to rage: ""Death to the Armenians! They mustbe killed!"" Then a woman went up on stage. I didn't see the woman because people were clinging to the podium like flies. I could only hear her. The woman introduced herself as coming from Kafan, and said that the Armenians cut her daughters' breasts off, and called, ""Sons, avenge my daughters!"" That was enough. A portion of the people on the square took off running in the direction of the factories, toward the beginning of Lenin Street.We stood there about an hour. Then the director of School 25 spoke, he gave a very nationalist speech. He said, ""Brother Muslims, kill the Armenians!"" This he repeated every other sentence. When he said this the crowd supported him stormily, whistling and shouting ""Karabagh!"" He said, ""Karabagh has been our territory my whole life long, Karabagh is my soul. How can you tear out my heart?"" As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh. ""It's our territory, the Armenians will never see it. The Armenians must be eliminated. From time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians, fromtime immemorial, that's the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years the Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth."" By filth he meant Armenians.I heard this. Before that I hadn't been listening to the speeches closely.Many people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with the other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn't penetrate,that in fact something serious was taking place. Then, when one of ourteachers said, ""Listen to what he's saying, listen to what idiocy he's spouting,"" we listened. That was the speech of that director. Before that we listened to the woman's speech.Right then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the subject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. Our director ofstudies, for whom I had great respect, he's an Azerbaijani . . . Before that Ihad considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to obtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. So he tells me,""Lyuda, you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square? If they find out that you're an Armenian they'll tear you to pieces. Should I tell them you're an Armenian? Should I tell them you're an Armenian?"" When he said it the first time I pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a second time. I turned to the director, Khudurova, and said that it was alreadyafter eight, I was expected at home, and I should be leaving. She answered, ""No, they said that women should stay here until ten o'clock,.and men, until twelve. Stay here."" There was a young teacher with us, her children were in kindergarten and her husband worked shifts. She asked to leave: ""I left my children at the kindergarten."" The director excused her. When she let her go Iturned around, said, ""Good-bye,"" and left with the young teacher, the Azerbaijani. I didn't see them after that.When we were walking the buses weren't running, and a crowd from the rally rannearby us. They had apparently gotten all fired up. It must have become too much for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed off. I wasn't afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher wouldn't say that I was an Armenian.To make it short, we reached home. Then Karina told of how they had been at the movies and what had happened there. I started telling of my experience andagain my parents didn't understand that we were in danger. We watched television as usual, and didn't even imagine that tomorrow would be our last day. That's how it all was.At the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance, we went to school together,Zhanna, I don't remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store on Narimanov Street. She was there with her father, for some reason she doesn't have a mother. The two of them were at home alone. While her father held the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the ground was wet and that there wasn't anyone behind the building when she went out on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the entryway. That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders there. She jumped. She jumped and didn't feel any pain in the heat of the moment. A few days later I found out that she couldn't stand up, she had been injured somehow. That's how people in Sumgait saved their lives, their honor, and their children: any way they could. Where it was possible, the Armenians fought back. My father's first cousin, Armen M., lives in Block 30. They found out by phone from one of the victims what was going on in town. The Armenians in that building all called one another immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even with muskets and went up to the roof. They took their infants with them, and their old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months, they got them right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. They hooked electricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. Then they took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she's an Azerbaijani who lived in their building. They called the school board directorand told her that if she didn't help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to escape alive and unharmed, she'd never see her daughter again. I'm sure, of course, that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the onlything that could have saved them at the time. She called the police. The Armenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. Two armored personnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway andled everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored personnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that very moment, into Block 30. That's how they defended themselves.I heard that our neighbors, Roman and Sasha Gambarian, resisted. They're big, strong guys. Their father was killed. And I heard that the brothers put up a strong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother.One of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking for the criminals on March 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected, people hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps dead. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went with the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found Azerbaijani corpses. I don't know how many. Even if they had been wounded and put down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or infection--that basement was filled with water. I heard this from the neighbors. And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject came up and they confirmed it. I know, too, that for several hours the basement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. And our neighborcarried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing as one of the criminals. Everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor took his, too, and carried it home. And when we came back, when everything seemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing of ours he had managed to ""save.""Raya's husband and father defended themselves. The Trdatovs defended themselves, and so did other Armenian families. To be sure there wereAzerbaijani victims, although we'll never hear anything about them. For some reason our government doesn't want to say that the Armenians were not just victims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too. In the TV show ""Pozitsiya"" [Viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that the Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. But that's not important, the truth will come out regardless.So that's the price we paid those three days. For three days our courage, our bravery, and our humanity was tested. It was those three days, and not the years and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we've become, what we grew up to be. Those three days showed who was who.On that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy. It should be saidthat it's not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishmentsreceived by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans will depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the Procuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga-tion. That's the price we paid to live in Armenia, to not fear going out on the street at night, to not be afraid to say we're Armenians, and to not fearspeaking our native tongue.

"Which objective system are you talking about?  What is its goal?Again, which brand of morality are you talking about?",0
"An interesting interpretation of Revelation 17 and 18 has been given by  evangelist David Wilkerson.  I am not saying that I totally agree with his  interpretation, but it is certainly believable and good food for thought.  He  interprets the Babylon of Revelation 17-18 as being none other than the good  old U. S. of A.  That's right, America.  He supports his claim in several ways.   The Babylon of Revelation is THE world leader in trade and commerce, and the  WHOLE WORLD wept when Babylon fell.  The American dollar, despite the Japanese  success of the 20th century, is STILL the most sought after currency in the  world.  If the U.S. were destroyed, wouldn't the whole world mourn?  The bible  also talks about Babylon being a home of harlots, sin, and adultery (I am  paraphrasing, of course).  Babylon's sin affected, or should I say, infected,  the whole world.  It doesn't take much looking to see that the U.S. is in a  state of moral decay.  Hasn't the American culture and Hollywood spread the ""do  it if it feels good"" mentality all over the world.  I think, though, that what  Mr. Wilkerson uses as his strongest argument is the fact that Revelation calls  Babylon ""Babylon the Great"" and portrays it as the most powerful nation on  earth.  No matter how dissatisfied you are with the state of our country, I  don't think you would have too much trouble agreeing that the U.S. is STILL the  most powerful nation on earth.Again, this interpretation is not NECESSARILY my own, but I do find it worthy  of consideration.",7

We accept disks in either Mac or IBMcompatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF orJPG.  If you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rathernot have to.At senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as theycan stand.  Even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can senda blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to get a slab-o-OTIS.As of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.

"Ethnocentric USian that I am, I've assumed that we and thexUSSR were the only countries with significant capabilities to tracknon-cooperative objects in low Earth orbit. Grazing in a couple of databases recently,  I found that Japan has some optical capabilitiesalong this line, and also uses a radar designed for other purposesfor orbital debris surveys (it isn't clear whether the radar can determine orbital elements for the objects it detects).

RPN: AIAA PAPER 90-1343     Distributions of orbital debris versus height and scattering cross section are determined from a series of observations made with a high-power VHF Doppler radar (MU radar) of Japan. An automated data processing algorithm has been developed to discriminate echoes of orbiting objects from those of undesired signals such as meteor trail echoes or lightning atmospherics. Although the results are preliminary, they showed good agreement with those from NORAD tracking radar      <----observations using a much higher frequency. It is found that the     <----collision frequency of a Space Station of 1 km x 1 km size at an altitude of 500 km with orbiting debris is expected to be as high as once per two years.

Radio Atmospheric Science Center.In International Council of Scientific Unions, Middle Atmosphere Program.Handbook for MAP, Vol. 20 5 pPublication Date: Jun. 1986      As the first attempt among MST (mesosphere stratosphere troposphere) type radars, the MU (middle and upper atmosphere) radar features an active phased array system. Unlike the conventional large VHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed to individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier feeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast beam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the antenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal division/combination are performed at a low signal level using electronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna beam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the zenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element is crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful calibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna element was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for this purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to make a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern monitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific satellite OHZORA (EXOS-C). A receiver named MUM (MU radar antenna Monitor) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400 watts transmitted from the MU radar. The principle of the measurement and results are discussed.",6
"   Sean, the 68070 exists! :-)   Sean, I don't want to get into a 'mini-war' by what I am going to say,but I have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you areclaiming on the Centris, you'll see why (please, no-flames, I reservethose for c.s.m.a :-) )   I was in Chicago in the last consumer electronics show, and Apple had abooth there.  I walked by, and they were showing real-time video captureusing a (Radious or SuperMac?) card to digitize and make right on the spotquicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one(1.5).   They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It played back quitenicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that itwasn't 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then heincreased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10<->12 fps.    Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (don't knowwhat model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktimecould play back at the same speed even on an LCII.   Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was havinga little bit of trouble.  And this wasn't even from the hardisk!  This wasfrom memory!   Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime, or somehardware assisted Centris, or another software product running the animation (like supposedly MacroMind's Accelerator?)?   Don't misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this.   But for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not, I canclaim 320x200 (a tad more with overscan) being done in 256,000+ colors in my computer (not from the hardisk) at 30fps with Scala MM210.

"OK, as one last attempt, I'll take a different tack.We all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for whyone can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is,is one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be todesign an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, andsee which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those ofus who have bikes are familiar.Let's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on itsown, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have toget rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patchesto transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have toremain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,through suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike thesame way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along a dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change surfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact patches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It probably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, but we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like because, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a better way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patchforces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface.You'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if itwas the rotation that did it.Looking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.Now we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude anddirection of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits themabout the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.How it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just lookingfor something that has contact patches that can go straight and notsideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-skior skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arrangedlike a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.I think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something likethat, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.Now I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to tryone of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy ina bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles verymuch like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.So we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's,a similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do havecountersteering.Conclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that havemotorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know whatreal effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observationsof how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm willing to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering. If you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle'sbehaviour is consistent with it. If someone can prove otherwise, go ahead.",18

"SSF is up for redesign again.  Let's do it right thistime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:[1] microgravity/vacuum process research[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)[3] spacecraft maintenence The old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was tocentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meettheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users took most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to tie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganizationand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on thesetwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvementin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial users have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the constellation.  Firstly, different functions are broken down into different constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:thus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,comsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the taskis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed.SSF's 3 main functions require quite different environmentsand are also prime candidates for constellization.[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:COMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab forshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area isinexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities on Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelabto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.We might also expand the research program to take advantage of interesting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt or gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system canbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a station is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,but also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiationenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelterof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, sinceastronauts will have little practical use in the space programuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, usingastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,and the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellationtether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravityin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of theradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,Earth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life supportmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VRinterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,follow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,testing out the actual environment at low cost before $billionsare spent on astronauts.[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in Clarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperatedrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers canpractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stucksolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,inject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can bespun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsatcompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.By applying the successful constellation strategy, and gettingrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, wehave radically improved the capability of the program whilegreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,we can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can studylife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety of space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuumresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purposeorbits.N.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space explorationas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  Mars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously we can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be usedto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting andsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology canbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecologygreenhouses on Mars at low cost.",6

"What do you mean by omnipotent here?  Do you mean by ""omnipotent""that God should be able to do anything/everything?  This createsa self-contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectivelyuseless.To be descriptive, omnipotence must mean ""being all-powerful"" andnot ""being able to do anything/everything"".Let me illustrate by analogy.Suppose the United States were the only nuclear power on earth.  Supposefurther that the US military could not effectively be countered by anynation or group of nations.  The US has the power to go into any countryat any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of theUS see fit.  The US would be militarily ""omnipotent"".But suppose further that the US holds to a doctrine/philosophy of notinterfering in the internal affairs of any nation, such as the currentcivil war in the former Yugoslavian states.Technically (in this scenario) the US would have the power to unilaterally go into Yugoslavia and straighten out the mess.  Buteffectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy of non-interference.  If the policy of non-interference were held tostrongly enough, then there would never be a question that it wouldever be violated.  Effectively, the US would be limited in what itcould actually do, although it had the power to do ""whatever it wanted"".The US would simply ""never want to interfere"" for such an idea wouldbe beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolatenon-interference policy.God is effectively limited in the same sense.  He is all powerful, butHe cannot use His power in a way that would violate the essence of whatHe, Himself is.I hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerningomnipotence.Regards,",0

"A few points about Mary's being taken into heaven at the end of her life onearth:One piece of evidence for Mary's assumption into heaven is the factthat no Christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she wasburied. Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the finalresting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one everclaimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why?Because everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.Although there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption ofMary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelationthat describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crownedin the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has otherinterpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.The assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship toChrist.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled therequirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, weare to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking hismother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, hetook his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not toallow her flesh to rot in the grave.One last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrineon the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Marydid not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe.The dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid sayingwhether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholictheologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would makesense: Christ died, and his Mother, who waited at the foot of thecross, would want to share in his death.",7

": I would like to get your opinions on this: when exactly does an engaged: couple become ""married"" in God's eyes?  Some say that if the two have: publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and: are unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective: qualifier) they are married/joined in God's sight.The way I read Scripture, a couple becomes married when they are *physically*married, i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse.e.g. the end of Genesis 2 (quoted from memory) ``for this reason, a man shallleave his parents and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh''(Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage).If you read through Genesis in particular, you will often come across thephraseology: ``[man] lay with [woman], and she became his wife''. Thisimplies that she became his wife when they lay together, i.e. at thepoint of intercourse.Compare this with Jewish tradition: Joseph, when he heard that Marywas pregnant, had it in mind to divorce her quietly -- but Mary and Joseph were*betrothed*, not married. i.e., they were in a binding relationship (whichrequired a divorce to get out of), but *marriage* would not occur until Maryand Joseph went to bed together.Compare with Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5, Revelation 19): the church isdescribed as the ``bride'' of Christ, but the *marriage* of the Lamb takes place when Jesus returns. i.e., we are in a binding love-relationship withJesus, but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage willtake place. I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse,because it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God.In summary, engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship, but it isnot marriage. A civil ceremony is not marriage either. Marriage occurs at thepoint when the betrothed couple go to bed together. (I don't mean to demean thecivil or church ceremony -- ours was great! I don't mean to be too pedantic.)Historically, I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony (i.e. amarriage recognised by the state), has only been around in the West sinceNapoleon, who introduced it to keep tabs on the people (although I'm ready to becorrected on that point!)This view obviously raises some questions:What about those who have had sex with one or more partners, without consideringmarriage. Are those people also ``married''?If it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse, is it necessaryto be married in the eyes of the state? (I would say Yes, because this honoursthe laws of our nations in the West. Although it is not illegal to sleeptogether though unmarried in most Western countries, I believe that it is God-honouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends beforeactually consummating our marriage. Its to do with our being salt and light, andalso to do with how people will perceive us; i.e. it is culturally insensitiveto declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony.)-- -----Michael Davis (cs89mcd@brunel.ac.uk)",7

These systems still have on-boardvideo and disk which are far better than the prior Value Point systems, andyou get VESA Local Bus for (future?) upgrades.  We are going to buy three ofthem with 17"" monitors (also a newly available), and one of the three willimmediately be upgraded to UltraStor 34F caching SCSI disk controller andeither the ATI GUP or the Viper graphics board.Do not buy a 486SX sytem.My personal philosophy on upgrade policy is that it is not loss-free.  Whenyou earn money you pay taxes, when you spend money you pay taxes.  (i.e. theyget you coming and going).  Translated this means take infrequent but largesteps.  You are far better off short term AND long term if you avoid the SXmodels and go straight to the DX or DX-2 models.",13
"The number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way over-exaggerated and exploited for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news media.  Thefacts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians in any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostlyto the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniqueswhich were technically possible only recently.The idea that ""hundreds of thousands"" of Iraqi citizens died isludicrous.  Not even ""hundreds of thousands"" of Iraqi soldiers died,and they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the USand its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians?Either the smart bombs didn't hit their targets (and we know they did),or they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive todestroying Iraq's military potential.  The military mission planners arenot fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war.Hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you,not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against theirtyrant-dictator. How about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in WW2?I don't hear you bemoaning them!  War is never an exact science, butwith smart bombs, it's becoming more exact with a smaller percentageof civilian casualties.  Sometimes mistakes are made; targets aremisidentified; innocents die.  That's war the way it really is.But the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earthlike it's one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get isworse.  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago, ""I know not whatcourse others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give medeath!""  War is always the price one must be willing to pay if onewishes to stay free.   Mathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here.You come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although Ifeel sure that was not your intent.So the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?  I'm sure that appeasement would haveworked better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I guess weshouldn't have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocentGerman civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor French who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  We should have just let Hitler take over Europe, and you'd be speakingGerman instead of English right now.Tyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped.  His kind don't understanddiplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret isthat Bush wimped out and didn't have the military roll into Baghdad, sonow Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people's sacrifice (not tomention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait was a good thing, but wiping Hussein off the map would've been better!And as for poor, poor Rodney King!  Did you ever stop and think *why*the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of ""not guilty""?Those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of thosepolicemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape.But the jury looked at *all* the evidence, evidence which you and Ihave not seen.  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of atrial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simplylowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mindwhich your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tendsto support in the case against the policemen.  Law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused,whether they be criminals or cops.  One is not found guilty if there isa reasonable doubt of one's guilt, and only the jury is in a positionto assess the evidence and render a verdict.  Anyone else is simplysuccumbing to verbal vigilantism.       Regards,",0

"My old jacket is about to bite the dust so I'm in the market for a new ridingjacket.  I'm looking for  recommendations for a suitable replacement.  I wouldlike to buy a full Aerostich suit but I can't afford $700 for it right now.I'm considering two basic options:1)  Buy the Aerostich jacket only.  Dunno how much it costs    due to recent price increases, but I'd imagine over $400.    That may be pushing my limit.  Advantages include the fact    that I can later add the pants, and that it nearly eliminates    the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit.2)  Buy some kind of leather jacket.  I like a few of the new     Hein-Gericke FirstGear line, however they may be a bit pricey    unless I can work some sort of deal.  Advantages of leather    are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose    value (we all know how important that is :-), possibly cheaper    than upper Aerostich.Requirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other layers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i'd prefer a zip-out lining, it MUST have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows, shoulders, forearms, possibly back/kidney protection, etc.), a reasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would be a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (belowfreezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.Please fire away with suggestions, comments, etc...Steve--",18

"terminatedIt is very possible to connect another internal hard disk in anymacintosh if you can find the space to put it. I have a IIsi that camewith a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped inanother 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did. First off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantumquarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for themwas stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had aproblem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together forover two months.The next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internalhard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. justsplice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboardconnector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a sparecable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be foundin any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properlysoldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility ofshorts or bad connections.Next, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard diskribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so whatI did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me anothermale connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,and is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using acrimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is notdamaged, and I can go back to the original setup.Having done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes forpower consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to thisday. In a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's ofthe drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives areintact.

Turkey has however ruled out, for the secondtime in one week, that it would intervene militarily in Azerbaijan.Wednesday, Inonu told reporters Ankara would not allow Azerbaijan to sufferdefeat at the hands of the Armenians. ""We feel ourselves bound to helpAzerbaijan, but I am not in a position right now to tell you what form (that)help may take in the future,"" he said.He said Turkish aid to Azerbaijan was continuing, ""and the whole world knowsabout it.""Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel reiterated that Turkey would not getmilitarily involved in the conflict. Foreign policy decisions could not be based on street-level excitement, he said.There was no immediate reaction in Ankara to regional reports, based onArmenian sources in Yerevan, saying Turkish pilots and other officers werecaptured when they were shot down flying Azerbaijani warplanes and helicopters.The newspaper Cumhuriyet said Turkish troops were digging in along the borderwith Armenia, but military sources denied reports based on claims by localpeople that gunfire was heard along the border. No military action has occurred, the sources said.The latest upsurge in fighting between the Armenians and Azerbaijanis flaredearly this month when Armenian forces seized the town of Kelbajar and laterpositioned themselves outside Fizuli, near the Iranian border.",9
"What an exciting thread (finally!)Mitra is Sanskrit for Friend, as such He started out as an avatar of Lord Visnu mentioned first in the Vedas. Later he seems to have risen to chief prominence worshipped by the Persians. Associated with the Sun but NOT the Sun, he is the lord of contract honor and obedience, therefore naturally worshipped by soldiers. He was ordered by the Sun to slay the bull of heaven and He reluct- antly agreed because of His obligation...the blood of that bull spilled and grew all earth life...then Mitra and the Sun sat down to eat.Worship of Lord Mitra ended in Persia with the ascension of the Zoroastrians.Hundreds of years later He was rediscovered and thrown into the Official Roman Pantheon (tm) for some semi-tricky reason, I forget why. But all references of Him ended abruptly when He was stricken from same, so apparently His worship was some sort of vehicle for advancement in the bureaucracy, like membership in the Communist Party was in the Soviet Bloc. The sociology of religion in ancient times is fascinating!Oh, His B-day was 25 Dec. Ahem.I am not sure if the mystery cult really lasted after His was booted from the Roman Imperial God Roster or what. It contained mostly soldiers, with 7 levels of initiation. They worshipped underground in caverns in pews. The bull horns in those temples were for scaring away or impaling evil spirits, I'm not sure that they had Mithraic significance or not.I don't know that the ritual meal was of a cannibalistic nature as is the Christian masses. But eating deities goes way back to Old Kingdom Egypt.Someone mentioned bullfighting. Did Mithraists sacrifice bulls? I forget. More likely, for a religious source, might be the shower of bull's blood enjoyed by the worshippers of Cybele on the Day of Blood? Cybele worship extended all throughout even up to France bigtime.",11

Version 1.21 is mainly a bugfix for THINK C users. THIS VERSIONNOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter forC programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems, feel free to contact me.The other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls fromthe FPU version to make it run faster.Those of you who don't know what all this is about, read on.********Programmers 3D GrafSys -- What it is:-------------------------------------Didn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of drawing three-dimensional scenes? Didn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure of three-dimensional molecules?And didn't the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from actually doing it?Well if the answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes, but what has it to do with this package???' , read on.GrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines for building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating (independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling) three dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.GrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-line/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.GrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallelprojections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showingoff for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explainwhat it all means later on). GrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines withdata so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routinesto do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines soyou don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)GrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above processors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.Both versions are *100% source compatibel*. GrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3Dgraphics and how to use the package.If demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. However, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use fora lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.GrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage.

"In <Apr.23.02.55.31.1993.3123@geneva.rutgers.edu>Tim asks:   This is probably too simplistic for some, but John 3:16 saus,   ""For God so loved the world that He gave His only son, that   whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life"".   Genesis 15:6, ""And he (Abram) believed the LORD; and He reckoned   it to him as righteousness"".   I don't find anywhere that God restricts heaven to particular   ethnic groups or religious denominations or any other category   that we humans like to drop people into. But He does REQUIRE   that we believe and trust Him. In Hebrews it says that God spoke   of old by the prophets (the old testament), but in these last days   he has spoken to us by His son Jesus Christ. And we learn of   Him through the pages of the New Testament. The Bible tells us   what we need to believe. For those who have never heard, I leave   them in God's capable care, He will make himself known as he   desires. It behooves each one of us to act upon the knowledge   we have. If you reject the claims of Jesus, and still go to   heaven, then the joke's on me. If you reject him and go to hell,   that's no joke, but it will be final.   Gerry",7

"Archive-name: space/astronautLast-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:02 $HOW TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT    First the short form, authored by Henry Spencer, then an official NASA    announcement.    Q. How do I become an astronaut?    A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it's probably    impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying    passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have    so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to    win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet    experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you    want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle ""mission    specialist"".    If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly    exceeds the supply.  NASA's problem is not finding qualified people,    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.	It is not enough    to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands    dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-    seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in    another seems to be a frequent winner.    Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.	(DO NOT get a    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term    effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other    significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,    you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor.    Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in    appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying    to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you    are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is    a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and    proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.    Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,    and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.    Keep your nose clean.    Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby;    experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.    Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,    43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were    a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).    If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job    at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant ""you    do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first"".    Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance    to demonstrate motivation.    Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn't make it the first time.    NASA    National Aeronautics and Space Administration    Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center    Houston, Texas    Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates    ==================================================================    Astronaut Candidate Program    ---------------------------    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for    Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates    to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be    considered.    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in    Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation    program.    Space Shuttle Program Description    ---------------------------------    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and    flight crew.    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space    Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include    government agencies and private industries.    The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,    and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are    assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA    astronauts.    Pilot Astronaut    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,    crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing    the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other    payload operations.    Mission Specialist Astronaut    Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,    have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations    in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and    experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to    have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed    knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and    objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission    specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling    using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific    experimental operations.    Astronaut Candidate Program    ===========================    Basic Qualification Requirements    --------------------------------    Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to    submitting an application.    Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidate:    1. Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering,    biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be    followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,    professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable and may be    substituted for part or all of the experience requirement (master's    degree = 1 year, doctoral degree = 3 years). Quality of academic    preparation is important.    2. Ability to pass a NASA class II space physical, which is similar to a    civilian or military class II flight physical and includes the following    specific standards:	 Distant visual acuity:	      20/150 or better uncorrected,	      correctable to 20/20, each eye.	 Blood pressure:	      140/90 measured in sitting position.    3. Height between 58.5 and 76 inches.    Pilot Astronaut Candidate:    1. Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering,    biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be    followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,    professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable. Quality of    academic preparation is important.    2. At least 1000 hours pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft. Flight    test experience highly desirable.    3. Ability to pass a NASA Class I space physical which is similar to a    military or civilian Class I flight physical and includes the following    specific standards:	 Distant visual acuity:	      20/50 or better uncorrected	      correctable to 20/20, each eye.	 Blood pressure:	      140/90 measured in sitting position.    4. Height between 64 and 76 inches.    Citizenship Requirements    Applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program must be citizens of    the United States.    Note on Academic Requirements    Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic    education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions --    specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum    in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor's    degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,    biological science, physical science, or mathematics.      The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the    sciences, are not considered qualifying:      - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology,	Medical Technology, etc.)      - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological	Psychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).      - Degrees in Nursing.      - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)      - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.    Application Procedures    ----------------------    Civilian    The application package may be obtained by writing to:	NASA Johnson Space Center	Astronaut Selection Office	ATTN: AHX	Houston, TX 77058    Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA    decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be    given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is    made. Applications received after that date will be retained and    considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate    continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from    consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the    preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be    requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as    supervisors and references may be contacted.    Active Duty Military    Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their    respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application    procedures will be disseminated by each service.    Selection    ---------    Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.    Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered    will be notified of the outcome of the process.    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following    their establishment.    General Program Requirements    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,    Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to    ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during    their candidate period.    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does    not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and    evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become    permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for    a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not    selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA    depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that    time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a    specified tour of duty.    NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified    minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.    Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.    Pay and Benefits    ----------------    Civilians    Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal    Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,    and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements    and experience.    Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and    participation in group health and life insurance plans.    Military    Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center    but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and    other similar military matters.",6

(I speakfrom expierence!)I'm not saying the Quad 4 is a bad engine, but don't highlight reliability when youcomparing it to a Acura Engine.  AND while the Integra costs alot more, it is abetter investment since it will hold its value considerably much better.  Anddoes a nice job at being a sporty car and practical at the same time.",17
"Hello,    Let me introduce a problem:   When I measure a sinusoidal wave (voltage) with a digital voltmeter, using AC mode, my output is an rms value (a peak value over 2 squared). / Right? /    When I measure a square wave in the same mode (AC), my output is equal to a peak value, actually, to the upper flat boundary of the wave.   I assumed, that a digital voltmeter makes some kind of integration of the input value, and divides it over the wave period. / Right?/   Now, I used it to measure the same  square wave as above, but distorted by high-frequency harmonics. Ideally, output should be the same, but...The output value was only about 10% of the previous one!    Why? What is the nature of this output value? What does the voltmeter actually measure? And what does it show?     Related question (less important to me):   What are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with analog ones?

In thiswork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for theexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and relyupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values andaesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, weredecisively rejected in Mackie's ""The Miracle of Theism"".  In the revisededition of ""The Existence of God"", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which hemakes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.J. L. MACKIE""The Miracle of Theism"", OxfordThis (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principalarguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classicalphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, throughthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatementsof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses thosepositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as ""replacements forGod"" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - lessformalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly directwhen compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.JAMES A.

"I _know_ I shouldn't get involved, but...   :-)[bit deleted]Righto, DAN, try this one with your Cornflakes...The book says that Muhammad was either a liar, or he was crazy ( a modern day Mad Mahdi) or he was actually who he said he was.Some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as follows.  Who would die for a lie?  Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar?  People gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing how his son-in-law made the sun stand still.  Call me a fool, but I believe he did make the sun stand still.  Niether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example anyone who is drawn to the Mad Mahdi is obviously a fool, logical people see this right away.Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the real thing.  --",0

"There has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and groundingpractices here.  A few points need to be clarified:The Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, orthe metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, tocarry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit thevoltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  Itshould never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry thenormal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters inthe power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the groundingconductor.  Much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltageson the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the groundingconductors to provide reliable operation  (""orange"" outlets are often used forthis, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and inmany cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should readboth the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications oninstalling quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulatedgrounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductorsback to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the serviceentrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Manyof these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not providea safe ground or a quiet ground or either. The GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which isreferred to in the code as the ""identified"" conductor and is supposed to bewhite or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground inmost electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrancepanel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many householdservice panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw whichattaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)  The Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  Inthe case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing thecircuit from the panel to the load device.  Since the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the groundingconductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distancefrom the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small butmeasurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load,under normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect thegrounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some ofthe neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Sincethere will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will alsono longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipmenthas a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the ""U""ground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. The difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a fewtenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does notpresent a shock hazard.  HOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contactwith an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator,a metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try toflow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, youwill get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc)Under the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible insome cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire ofinadequate size, causing it to overheat.With the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is ashort circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which mayflow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, whichincreases the possibility for shock or fire.  Also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage onthe ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, oftencausing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts intechnical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.The Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer aswell as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily forlightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path backto ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to groundedobjects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fusesquickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from thedwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of itflows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may causecorrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks,and it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loopbetween the ""hot"" conductors in the service and the neutral current in thewater pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. (don't flame ME on this, I'm just telling you where the field comes from, notit's health effect, as far as I'm concerned, the jury is still out on this.)Note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at anysub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run serviceentrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must havea seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in thisapplication only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to thegrounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bondingscrew, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be aboveground, with the possible problems listed above.The code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from onebuilding to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may beused as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperatewire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. These exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the daysbefore U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don't want tohave to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don't want tohave to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in placeof three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperateneutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings(since most current is in the 220 volt ""hots"" except at some low settings, thewires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. So far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings,it's primarily for lightning protection.People doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal groundingconductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in ""romex"" 'with ground' is.  Anywherethere is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a goodgrounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxesis a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run underthe steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut thisaluminum band off at the ends, you don't have to bond it to anything, it doesits job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwalltubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bondinglocknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.  ""Greenfield"" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the emptysheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn't havethe aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance andinductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside thegreenfield.""Wiremold"" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxesoften prevents good contact, and the ""feed"" to the wiremold extension is oftenfrom a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremoldbox.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold andthe cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were ""hot"" with120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiatorhere in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and oneof the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run aground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box inthe original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can ""bond"" the wire to thebox with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.On another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outletswhen ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use themwithout a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have theprotection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don'tinstall it.  The interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip.  It isdesirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground isconnected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in,whereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or somethingprovides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungroundedGCFI's, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my '93code is in the city, but I know the rule hasn't changed.  It might berenumbered though.) We have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much moreto this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.  John",4

(6)  Both of the choices you give Stephen assume that he condoned     taking quotes out of context in A.(7)  I assumed you were being logical, and that the sentence that begins     ""Could you please explain ..."" was not a nonsequitur, but was intended     to follow from the sentence that preceded it.(8)  Therefore, I concluded that you believed that (2) implied that Stephen     condoned taking quotes out of context in A(9)  But we've already seen that (2) does not imply this(10) Therefore, you were incorrect to believe that (2) implied that Stephen     thought it was okay to take quotes out of context in A, and were      making an error of a kind that is frequently made by creationists.Is that better Jim?

It-> asserts that the right to keep and bear arms is essential for-> maintaining a milita. -> a free state.Yes, I agree the first half of the amendment does modify the noun militia.  But the difinition of modify that applies to how ""well regulated"" modifies ""militia"" is:	to qualify or limit the meaning of.  For example, ""wet""	modifes ""day"" in the phrase ""a wet day.""The amendment is similiar to the statement:	A wet day, being annoying, the right of the people to keep	and wear boots, shall not be infringed.So how does a dry day pertain the right to use boots?

"It helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion - or at leasta reasonable model of the class of distortion.  Below is a very shortdescription of the process which we use; if you have further questions,feel free to poke me via e-mail.================================================================*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.   Consider deleting these edges.1) Now, there are two goals:    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)'s)       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured        using the digitized (x,y)'s).2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For   example:    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the       Reference(x,y).     b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge       the correct length (where ""correct"" is the DigitizedLength).        Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).alpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Considerhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insiston the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want tobalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in lengthof the edges.WARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must beobserved (essentially, you can't allow the convex hull to change, andyou can't allow triangles to ""fold over"" neighboring triangles.  Both ofthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion ofindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using the current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from theoriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time wasprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try andchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.

"I know it's a long shot, but maybe someone went through this and will havesome comments to share.The story is this: I bought a car out of state, and I'm trying to getthe safety inspection in Pennsylvania. The problem is that the car has aftermarket tint on all windows except the windshield. The tint is ratherweak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.The inspection garage said that they won't pass it unless I get awaiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - theofficer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get awaiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him toshow me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal.  Heshowed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, ifyou can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I toldhim that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the bookand said ""It's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give youa ticket for it right now."" Well, won't argue with that...Since the vehicle code says it's OK as long as you can see through thetint, I'd like to keep it (I'll re-read the vehicle code in thelibrary).  I'd also like to get some sort of paper from the policethat says it's OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won'tget in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn't mind registeringa complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.So does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper fromthe police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experienceregistering a complaint against an officer? I called the station later on today, but they basically said there is no place where Icould register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decideto keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance doI stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?Any comments about it will be welcome!",17

"Well, I'd say you're mostly right, but for different reasons. (BTW, as of acouple years ago, the most stolen bikes in Orange County and SF were 750GSX's and Ninjas). Probably the biggest reason BMWs aren't ripped off is thatmost people who buy BMWs will only deal with the actual BMW dealer, or mail-order types. Most of these can have their inventory checked fairly easilyby law-enforcement types, and their mark-up is usually sufficient to keep them honest about acquiring parts. For Harleys and rice-rockets, you've got 2 different situations. There is aHUGE aftermarket in Harley parts, so a bike can be parted out fairly easily.Ditto the non-sport Japanese bikes, but the prices on the parts for these arenot as high, comparatively. For the 'rockets', anytime a bike goes down, the plastic is usually cracked, and is expensive to replace. It's fairly easy,then, for a disreputable shop to take a fairing from a stolen bike, slap iton a bike in for repair, repaint it, and make a tidy profit.

"The observation that the Tree of Life would rotate clockwise in thenorthern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern probably doesn'tgive enough consideration to the feebleness of the Coriolis force comparedto, say, the phototropism of vegetation.

So it's more valid to talk ofthe clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of coursenot.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether theanti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, orbecause it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.

"Here is a press release from the White House. President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A To: National Desk Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100   WASHINGTON, April 20 -- Following are remarks by President Clinton in a question and answer session with the press:1:36 P.M. EDT     THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federalagents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the lawagainst the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiledweaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-daystandoff ensued.     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made everyreasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end withoutbloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts wereultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they weredealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probablyinsane.     He engaged in numerous activities which violated bothfederal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover,responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during theaction against the compound in February.  Given his inclinationtowards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, noprovocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federalagents against the compound.     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno onan operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure onKoresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.The plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, evenin the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not causepermanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the peoplein the compound to come outside and to surrender.     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  Idiscussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions Ithought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do whatshe thought was right, and I take full responsibility for theimplementation of the decision.     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.Mr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federalagents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were hiscaptives, as well as all the other people who were there who did notsurvive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimateresponsibility for the carnage that ensued.     Now we must review the past with an eye towards thefuture.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice andTreasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation touncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have beendne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independentprofessional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  Iexpect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is requiredto complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments tocooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we cancontinue to be fully accountable to the American people.     I want to express my appreciation to the AttorneyGeneral, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on thefront lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficultcircumstances.     Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorryfor the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the endof this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will betempted to join cults and to become involved with people like DavidKoresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen overthe last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficultsituations which federal agents confronted there and which they willbe doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the futurewill be somewhat better handled and better understood because of whathas been learned now.     Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why,after 51 days, you decided --     Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it isthat Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversationwith --     THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will gofirst and then the other.     Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --     Q  Mr. President --     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but Ican't do it at once.     Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday aboutthe nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney Generalthat the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take anotherstep in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And shedescribed generally what the operation would be -- that they wantedto go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to causepermanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make itvery difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it washoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.     I was further told that under no circumstances would ourpeople fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going toshoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them andthere would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awfullot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.There were no shots coming back from the government side.     I asked a number of questions.  The first question Iasked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasonsI was given were the following:     Number one, that there was a limit to how long thefederal authorities could maintain with their limited resources thequality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might beneeded in other parts of the country.     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this hadnever seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convincedthat no progress had been made recently and no progress was going tobe made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cultmembers to come out.     Number three, that the danger of their doing somethingto themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, withthe passage of time.     And number four, that they had reason to believe thatthe children who were still inside the compound were being abusedsignificantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary andunsafe conditions.     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they hadgiven consideration to all of the things that could go wrong andevaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She saidthat the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them wereconvinced that the chances of bad things happening would onlyincrease with the passage of time.     The third question I asked was, has the military beenconsulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco,that's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obviousthat this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Militarypeople were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and someof the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if themilitary had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that theyhad, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only oneminor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelmingsignificance.     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, Isaid that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that sheshould proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by thattoday.     Q  Mr. President --     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.     Q  Can you address the widespread perception --reported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you weretrying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The onlyreason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the onlyreason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing toadd to what was being said and I literally did not know until ratherlate in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those whohad been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken intocustody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for eventsto unfold.     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why peoplespeculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney Generalon the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.I called her again late last night after she appeared on the LarryKing Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- itis not possible for a President to distance himself from things thathappen when the federal government is in control.     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprisedwould be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that theAttorney General should resign because some religious fanaticsmurdered themselves.  (Applause.)     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in thislife to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  Thesepeople killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They wereheavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly,and they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could toavoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolatethemselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about thechildren.     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno,is when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want youto tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- whyyou believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And shesaid, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that thosechildren are still being abused and that they're in increasinglyunsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easierwith time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word forthat.  So that is where I think things stand.     Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this wasmishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out ofpatience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you reallydecide that way?     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assumeis just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI hasdone a lot of things right for this country over a long period oftime.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed theWorld Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiryto analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else weshould have known?  Is there some other question they should haveasked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I sayfor sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to makethe outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I wantthe inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we havesome independent law enforcement people, not political people, buttotally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the bestevidence we have.     There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort offanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront itagain.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do,particularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it isimportant to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were thepeople who killed others and then killed themselves.     Q  Mr. President, were there any other optionspresented to you for resolving this situation at any point fromFebruary 28th until yesterday?     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports allalong the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you goback -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very goodjob of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursuedany number of other options all along the way, and a lot of themearly on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some ofthe other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed tobe some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and theauthorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and thingsjust began to spin downward.     Whether there were other -- in terms of what happenedyesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did notinvolve other options except whether we should take more time withthe present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said theywanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to getpeople out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.That's what they thought.     Q  Did the government know that the children did nothave gas masks?     Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- areyou in agreement with that?     THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can dowhatever they want.  But I think it's very important that theTreasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bringin some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if anycongressional committees want to look into it, we will fullycooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably themost well-covered operation of its kind in the history of thecountry.",8

"I would be very wary of retail outlets selling as cheap as educational prices!I went for a retailer, actually mail order (CDA computers), because its pricewas better thant the campus computer store. I found out why later on when Itried to get a repair done at an Apple registered repair center - the CPU was aresale. The serial number had been removed and replaced with a non-standardnumber (probably from CDA computers). Consequently, the Apple repair man couldnot do ANY warrenty repairs. So I ended up with just a 90day warrenty from CDAover the Apple 12month warrenty. Boy, was I pi**ed! Moral of the story, CAVEATEMPTOR.However, if you go with a reliable, trustworthy mail order firm (if they exist- maybe someone could enlighten us with their experiences), you will probablyget a better price than your local educational outlet simply because mail orderout of state does not REQUIRE sales tax yet. Though for how much longer remainsto be seen. The addition in sales tax on a CPU purchase will probably wipe outan educational discount. Again CAVEAT EMPTOR, some mail order companies DOinclude sales tax on purchases even if they are out of state, so check!",14

The estimated population of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem. Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the  Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897, however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character  notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian  Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the  southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.""

Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They  found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border  into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole  length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to  Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain  plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of  Tartar villages.

"       This seems a strange argument to make considering that Canada'sviolent crime rate in general is far lower than that of the U.S.  (Ournon-gun crime rate is greater than their *entire* crime rate).  Itwould seem strange to suggest that it, to, were the result of guncontrol laws.       I think if we looked we'd find very specific (cultural andenforcement) reasons why the non-gun rate is low as well, and thenthat reasons could be applied to the with-gun rates as easily.

(Which is now, by the way, blaming their risinggun-crime rate on the U.S.  Strange that the border used to ""magically""keep the guns out, but now isn't.)       The other side of the coin, of course, is that far ""illegal drugs""are purchases legally or stolen from people who purchase them legally. I've still not been convinced that guns, a commodity which criminalshave shown their perfectly willing to pay for from illegal sources(stolen either from police, military, or civilian) we wouldn't simplysee South American sources from which drugs come start smuggling guns aswell, since there's a thriving gun manufacturing industry down there.        And as was not pointed out in the study, but in critiquesof it, (two seperate articles by James Wright and David Kopel cometo mind) it was pointed out that the difference was *also* almostentirely minority related.  That is, the gun crime rate skyrocketedfor poor minorities (Blacks and Hispanics primarily) while when youcompared the white majority they were virutally identical.        The problem with the NEJM study was they compared minority vs.non-minority percentages but failed to take into account the relativeconditions of those minorities.  That there was an eqaul percentage ofnomn-whites was about as far as they went.  They failed to take intoaccount that the non-whites in either city were not living in thesame conditions.        If the situation was entirely based on availability of guns,then we'd expect that the white rates, the two groups which arearguably fairly comparative in the two cities, would have a farhigher rate in Seattle.  Yet the majority in Seattle is not onlynot significantly higher when the minorities are excluded, but slightlylower.       The point is, of course, that many of the U.S. ""inner-city""problems are not mirrored in Canada.  As such  if there is a conditionwhich is significantly different in Canada from the U.S., and violentcrime is highly correlated to that area, suggesting that gun controlis the source of Canada's low rate is highly questionable.  (As oneCanadian pointed out on talk.politics.guns, Canada's major gun controlin 1978 did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increasein violent crime rates, which have been rising steadily since.  Apparentlythey didn't even mirror the U.S.s very large drop of violent crime inthe early eighties.       True only to a certain extent.  Take Washington D.C., wheregun control was instituted while it had crime problems true, but thatcrime proceeded to explode afterwards.  Similarly for New York.       The question is not simply a point in time where crime was highor low.  Did the gun control significantly and positively impactviolent crime.  Since it's gone up in those areas, often faster than itwas going up before, you can't simply dismiss the high crime rate bysaying gun control was caused by it.  Yes, gun control may be institutedto deal with high crime.  But if the crime is not positively impacted, youcan't continually say that that crime rate was entirely a cause ofthat gun control, since much of that crime rate increased after gun controlwas implemented, just as happened in Canada.       As would be expected if violent crime was generally independentof gun control.       Would this be the laws which made manufacturers liable for whatothers did with their guns, and suddenly the police found nobody wouldsell to them?",10

"Well put, Jim.  I am as concerned about the media's complicity in thisgrowing coverup.  Can you imagine the media outrage, the lawsuits, theinvestigations that would emit if the government kept the media away fromany other story?  Particularly if a Republican administration had beenbehind it.  What's going on here?Let's look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next.I'm a student of human phychology, particularly in the area of psy-opsbecause I've found some of the techniques to be useful in businessnegotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEURknows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do apsychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI hadprofessionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh's behavior wasemminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away fromcivilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve theirisolation.  It would also be typical, given Koresh's religiousorientation, for such an individual to interpret a government assault asthe apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to beingconsumed in the apocalypse.IMHO, the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentratedpsy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course ofaction designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publiclyappearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered thetanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations.They KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles,obstensibly to perform ""gas insertions"" (love that NewSpeak) WOULD pushhim over the edge.Look at some supporting evidence.  Koresh's attorney mentioned on TVearlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh's major concern was the biblicalrole of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Renoon Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning)claimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was truethey KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW theywere pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational andreasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, atthe first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back andwould have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the""gas insertion"" right up to the point where flames appeared.  The imagethat will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting backand forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.Let's step back and assess how this thing could have been ended withoutbloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agencyinterested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservationof life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.The way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back,abandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed thearmor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploitedhis ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  Asimple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tellhow he whipped the US government would have been something he could nothave resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left thecompound.  Simple, clean and safe but because it would have required theFBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of therevenge they sought, it was totally out of the question.

"-*----The two commandments *are* rules; they are merely rules that areso vague that they are practically devoid of meaning.  MichaelSiemon acknowledges this every time he writes that the resolutionof an argument over them turns on secular and culturalassumptions that are independent of these rules. The commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed,in part, as reminding man that he is not God and cannot act as ifhe has ""ultimate responsibility."" Indeed, many traditions presentan interpretation where believers are supposed to interpretloving one's neighbor as following various other rules, andrelying on their god to make things come out right, preciselybecause it would be wrong for man to assume such ""ultimateresponsibility."" Once again, we are confronted with good soundinggoo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean. And who is to say that this interpretation is ""twisted""?  Thereare many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforwardreading show the Christian god behaving in just this way.Michael cannot refer to ""base"" claims or base commandments toshow that such readings are ""twisted,"" because this divergence inunderstanding occurs even in trying to interpret the ""base""claims and commandments.  In addressing conservative Christians,Michael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notionsthat these conservative Christians will reject.  But these base commandments are too vague to serve as  ""aprinciple for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems."" The meaning ofthese base commandments for any believer derives from the secularand cultural notions that the believer brings to them, from howthe believer mixes their demands with straightforward readings ofother Biblical passages, from a particular sectarian tradition,or from some combination of these things.  These commandmentslack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis forcriticizing ethical systems.  What meaning they have comes fromthe ethical system the believer brings to these commandments. Jesus explicitly states that this summarizes Jewish law, whichwould seem to bring in all of it if we properly understand whatit means to love God and love our neighbors.  There are *many*parables and teachings the gospels attribute to Jesus that arestraightforwardly read as ethical commandments.  The Paulineepistles are similarly full.  If it is not clear that these allcome together in a sensible understanding of ethical behavior,the problem is *not* a lack of raw material. -*----No, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel seriously.  What differentiates you is the way you interpret thegospel.In a sense, the wide variety of interpretations does tell ussomething about Christianity.  It tells us that the New Testamentauthors left a sufficiently vague hodge-podge that it can serveas the source text for many, vastly different beliefs about thenature of the Christian god and about what men should andshouldn't do. The irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity perse that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians andgays.  *Every* Christian principle he turns to this cause iseffective only through the extra-Christian principles throughwhich Michael interprets his religion, and the homophobes applythe *same* Christian principles, with equal justification, totheir cause.  In short, it is the extra-Christian principles thatmake Michael's Christianity beneficial, and I suspect they wouldbe as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered byChristian interpretation.  Michael paints a picture of ""standard American atheism"" as therejection of the evil in many conservative Christianinterpretations of the Bible.  But I think it is even moredamaging to Christianity to note that the New Testament presentssuch a vague hodge-podge of notions about the nature of God andthe nature of the good (except, of course, when it is ordered byan interpretation that relies on extraneous principles).  Here, Ithink we should apply a Christian parable, where a cold drink canhave its value and a hot drink can have its value, but thelukewarm we should spit out. ",11

"	Again I find myself wanting to respond to a posting and having neitherthe time nor the proper materials with me (you would think I would learn mylesson by now--but I'm trying to finish writing my Thesis and don't have tonsof time.  Anyway...)	The basis for our (the catholic church's) belief in the assumption ofMary, body and soul, into heaven is that, to put it simply, the apostles and all the early generation Christians believed it.  In fact, throughout theirministry the apostles kept in close contact with Mary, and 11 of the 12 werepresent when she died.  Only Thomas was missing--when he arrived several dayslater, he asked to be shown her body, and moved with pity, Peter and several ofthe other apostles brought him to her tomb.  When they arrived the seal wasstill unbroken.  They broke the seal, entered, and the body was missing.  Therewas no sign that anyone had entered, forcibly or otherwise, and everything elsewas laid out exactly as it had been left.  The apostles present all believedthat Mary was assumed into heaven--and the apostles TAUGHT this in their  preaching (of course, this does not appear in any of the texts currently considered part of the bible, but it does appear in other writings left behindby several of them.)  Basicaly, as an apostolic church (ie. founded by theapostles), we believe that the teachings of the apostles, whether written downin the bible or written down in other sources, is true, providing that theauthenticity of those other sources can be confirmed.  At least in the case ofthe assumption of Mary, the authenticity is quite clear.",7

"	The runner can leave his base at any time.  If the ball is caught,he's got to tag up.  If it isn't caught, he _doesn't_ have to tag up atall.  So, if he's feeling lucky, your runner at second can sprint for gloryas soon as the ball is popped up.  If it isn't caught, he's probably scoreda run.  If it is, he's probably headed for AAA.  	The only effect the infield fly has is to make the batter out,thereby removing the force on the runners on base.

RasterOps 24si (24-bit accelerated, hardware zoom/pan, 4 meg RAM):------------------------------------------------------------------Renamed the 24sx a few months after I bought it, this board is for 13""monitors, providing **accelerated 24-bit**, hardware zoom/pan, NTSC mode(you can plug it into something like the RasterOps Video Expander and outputNTSC), and 4 RAM slots that use 1 meg or 4 meg SIMMS for GWorld RAM, or aRAM disk. Software included for such functions. 4 meg of RAM included (1 megSIMMS). Selling for $605 at Bottom Line (without the RAM - add $100), I'm asking**$525** (shipping included this time, it's just a card). Original box andpackaging. I'd actually prefer to sell the Sony monitor and this cardtogether, so if you want both, drop me e-mail and make a ""bundled offer""for these items. ------------ Cheers. dan keldsen - djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu",14
"I have written a program and I want to market it.  I would like certain degreeof protection, since my main custmers are individuals and not the cooperations.   I know laser hole burning method, and hardware key method,however, my  software is going to cost only $15.00, so I can not afford that.Also, at this low price I can not afford people make too many copy of mysoftware. Well, I guess say upto %20 illigal copying is ok by me.However, I do not want someone to get a copy of PCTools and copy my software.  Off course, I never meant to forbid the true hackers from copying, since theycan develope a better program anyway.

"I don't think they provide homeopaths, heck the heir apparent was trying to promote Osteopaths to the ranks of eligibility a couple of years back... It pleased my family no end, since I'm at an Osteopathic school, sort of validated it for them...then I told them that the name was the same but the practice was different....oh.	If you're seeking validation for your philosophy on the strength of the national health service adopting it, I suggest that you are not very sure of the validity of your philosophy. I believe in 1946, the NHS was still having its nurses taught the fine art of ""cupping"", which is the vacuum extraction of intradermal fluids by means of heating a cup, placing it on the afflicted site and allowing it to cool.	I wouldn't take my sick daughter to a homeopath.",5

"	I disagree: every proposition needs a certain amount of evidence and support, before one can believe it. There are a miriad of factors for each individual. As we are all different, we quite obviously require different levels of evidence.	As one pointed out, one's history is important. While in FUSSR, one may not believe a comrade who states that he owns five pairs of blue jeans. One would need more evidence, than if one lived in the United States. The only time such a statement here would raise an eyebrow in the US, is if the individual always wear business suits, etc.	The degree of the effect upon the world, and the strength of the claim also determine the amount of evidence necessary. When determining the level of evidence one needs, it is most certainly relevent what the consequences of the proposition are.	If the consequences of a proposition is irrelvent, please explain why one would not accept: The electro-magnetic force of attraction between two charged particles is inversely proportional to the cube of their distance apart. 	Remember, if the consequences of the law are not relevent, thenwe can not use experimental evidence as a disproof. If one of the consequences of the law is an incongruency between the law and the state of affairs, or an incongruency between this law and any other natural law, they are irrelevent when theorizing about the ""Truth"" of the law.	Given that any consequences of a proposition is irrelvent, including the consequence of self-contradiction or contradiction with the state of affiars, how are we ever able to  judge what is true or not; let alone find""The Truth""?	By the way, what is ""Truth""? Please define before inserting it in the conversation. Please explain what ""Truth"" or ""TRUTH"" is. I do think that anything is ever known for certain. Even if there IS a ""Truth"", we could never possibly know if it were. I find the concept to be meaningless.--       ""Satan and the Angels do not have freewill.

"about 2.5Kbyte without Novell 3.11 support.No.No.Nearly all.We run mixed WNT beta and W4WG, no problem apart from printer sharing( beta problem)We had problems with mouse drivers using W4WG where Windows 3.1 didn't, seems to be more critical about it. It was actualy a port problem with the network card running on 0x2e0, we changed it to 0x300, now everything is allright, I think it has to do with the AMI Bios as well.",12

"Just a shot here, but ya never know:I once bought a (REAL) cheap equalizer / power amp for my car tape player at one of those motel-room truckload sales, and it sounded great.  For a while, that is.  Then one channel quit entirely.  I opened it up, and the amplifier chip for the bad channel had simply melted some of its solder joints attaching it to the PCB.  I soldered them back and it worked fine.  I just had to keep the volume a bit lower than I did before.  Probably lousy heat sinking.You said ""a nice Alpine"" which I'm sure is a few orders of mag higherin quality than the P.O.S. I had.  But the point is - look inside beforeyou scrap it, since you OCCASIONALLY find something you can repair.Maybe even the same thing I found.",4
"This is a two-sided problem. Unfortunately our culture has been deteriorating over time.The ""breeding"" of these low-life's is getting worse; our justice system is at bestextremely weak to handle these problems. That is why low-abiding citizens should havethe power to protect themselves and their property using deadly force if necessary anywhere a threat is imminent.My Camaro (my pride and joy) got stolen right out of my driveway a few years back.The persons that did that were eventually caught (lucky for me!) but not beforehaving trashed the car.On another occasion, on my way from Texas to Florida, I had stopped in a small motelfor the night in a small town somewhere in Florida. About 5 youths were disturbing mycar, setting off the alarm and challenging me to come out. When I and another tenantwalked out with a 357 Magnum and a 45 automatic respectively, they vanished. Needless to say, I immediately packed-up and left.Watch out for car-jacking and staged accidents. They can be deadly!",17
"The fact that she was wearing a miniskirt with no underwear waspresented as evidence that she was a prostitute, and the courtapparently found this compelling.Clayton does indeed know the difference.

I think George is referring to switch.zip in the ~ftp/pub/pc/win3/drivers/videodirectory. Description reads -- Switcher: Windows Video Mode Switcher.,12
